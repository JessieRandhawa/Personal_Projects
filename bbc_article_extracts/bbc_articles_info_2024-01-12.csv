Watch: Fighter jets strike targets in Yemen

Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first.

But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence.

The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"".

In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"".

Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation.

Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress.

""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.""

""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us.""

Pramila Jayapal and other progressives fumed that President Biden had bypassed Congress

Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval.

""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas.

US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval.

After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"".

But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress.

Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades.

Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action.

Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision.

""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night.

""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added.

Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed.

""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said.

Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action.

Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel.

The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life; degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim.

The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"".

The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim.

But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal.","Progressive Democrats fume over Houthi strikes as Republicans offer rare praiseBy Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue BBC News, WashingtonWatch: Fighter jets strike targets in YemenProgressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Watch: Video shows impact of snow storm in Iowa ahead of caucus

A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend.

From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state.

Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday.

It is the week's third major US storm.

Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard.

A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York.

Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021.

In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C).

The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021.

Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need.

He said another days-long blackout was unlikely.

""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat.

Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor.

To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated.

In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"".

Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan.

Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois.

Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power.

The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children.

The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states.

Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.

In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph. Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned.

""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often.""

Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas.

In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph.

However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US.

Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high.

A blizzard in Iowa is hampering campaigning for the Iowa caucuses

The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"".

Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State.

Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"".

Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country.

By Holly Honderich in Des Moines, Iowa

Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.

On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border.

At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump.

""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said.

The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines.

Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back.

Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls.

""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday.

The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with.""

The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points.

Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics; that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense.

""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project.

""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do.""

Nikki Haley made her pitch to voters in an Iowa pub on Tuesday

So what exactly is her game plan?

Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win.

They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election.

In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said.

Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state.

Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her.

Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump.

""She's not up to this,"" he said.

Ms Haley seems poised to overtake Ron DeSantis for second place

Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations.

""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina.

Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop.

Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote.

""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple.""

Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars.

In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces.

""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted.""

Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election.

""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points.""

But she has to defeat Mr Trump first.

""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant.

Ms Haley has cast herself as Mr Trump's main rival

At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley.

""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider.""

The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre.

She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else.

Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming.

In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"".

Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations.

Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first.""

The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa.

The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?

By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent

Stellarium

An artist's impression highlighting the positions of the Big Ring (in blue) and Giant Arc (shown in red) in the sky.

Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space.

It is 1.3bn light-years in diameter and appears to be roughly 15 times the size of the Moon in the night sky as seen from Earth.

Named the Big Ring by the astronomers, it is made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

They say that it is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe.

It cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power.

Such large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe.

Although stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form.

The Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play.

According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing.

""This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time,"" he said.

NASA

A view from the Hubble space telescope shows that galaxies are evenly distributed in the Universe

The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure spanning 3.3bn light-years of space.

Asked how it felt to have made the discoveries, she said: ""It's really surreal. I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can't believe that I'm talking about it, I don't believe that it's me

""Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,"" she said.

""And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important - but what exactly?""

Both the Big Ring and the Giant Arc appear relatively close together, near the constellation of Bootes the Herdsman.

Professor Don Pollacco, of the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects might be related and form an even larger structure.

""So the question is how do you make such large structures?

""It's incredibly hard to conceive of any mechanism that could produce these structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the early universe where waves of high and low density material are 'frozen' in to extragalactic medium.""

There are also similarly large structures discovered by other cosmologists - such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length, and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across.

But the biggest single entity scientists have identified is a supercluster of galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion light-years wide.

While the Big Ring appears as an almost perfect ring on the sky, analysis by Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face aligned with Earth.

""The Big Ring and the Giant Arc, both individually and together, gives us a big cosmological mystery as we work to understand the universe and its development.""

The findings have been presented at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in New Orleans.

By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague BBC News

Watch: 'Distorted factual picture' presented by South Africa - Israeli lawyer tells ICJ

Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.

South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ.

South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza.

It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity.

The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable.

Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case.

Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart.

On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa.

A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere.

South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening.

Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case.

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war.

In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"".

South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"".

Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"".

He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas.

Watch: ""Israel has genocidal intent in Gaza"", says lawyer representing South Africa

On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"".

Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"".

Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"".

""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court.""

In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".

The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"".

""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation.""

Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ.

A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong.""

""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said.

What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched.","Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide caseBy Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague BBC NewsWatch: 'Distorted factual picture' presented by South Africa - Israeli lawyer tells ICJIsrael has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.

By Sam Cabral BBC News

Carlos Moore Law Group

Aderrien Murry survived the shooting but suffered a collapsed lung, fractured rib and lacerated liver

Attorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi.

It follows last week's release of body camera footage from the moments before Aderrien Murry was shot in his home after calling police for help.

He suffered a collapsed lung, fractured ribs and a lacerated liver. His family is suing the city where it took place.

The officer involved has been cleared of criminal conduct and reinstated.

The flurry of new information about the May 2023 shooting in the city of Indianola follows a nearly seven-month probe by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI).

Last month, the state's attorney general said Sergeant Greg Capers will not face charges after a grand jury determined the bureau's findings showed no evidence of criminal conduct on his part.

Sergeant Capers, who was placed on unpaid administrative leave after the shooting, has since re-joined the Indianola Police Department.

But the Murry family has continued to argue the shooting was not justified, with Aderrien's mother, Nakala, pushing for footage from the incident to be publicly released.

The newly released 911 recordings raise questions about whether Mr Capers knew there was a child in the house when he and another officer responded to domestic disturbance calls placed by Ms Murry's mother, who was not there, and then by Aderrien.

A man later identified as John Nolden, the father of one of Ms Murry's other children, had shown up unexpectedly at the home in the early hours of the morning.

That led a frightened Ms Murry to give her son a cell phone and ask him to call for help, first by informing his grandmother and then by calling 911.

Last Friday, in response to Ms Murry's repeated pleas, state officials released body camera footage of the moments leading up to the shooting of Aderrien.

The video shows Mr Capers approaching the Murry home with a colleague, repeatedly banging on the front door and - with permission from the 911 dispatcher - unsuccessfully attempting to kick it open.

When Ms Murry opens the door, he is heard twice shouting: ""Let me see your hands."" Ms Murry immediately complies.

""Where's he at?"" Mr Capers then asks twice. As Ms Murry gestures inside the home with her head, he asks her to come out of the house and she steps outside.

The officer is then heard repeatedly asking the intruder to come out, adding ""don't make us come in"".

He also asks if the man is armed, to which Ms Murry appears to respond that he is not.

As Mr Capers enters the empty living room, Aderrien walks into the frame with his hands over his head.

Mr Capers immediately opens fire, shoots him in the chest and then says ""Oh, my god"".

As the boy screams in pain and runs out the door yelling for his mother, the officer begins calling for an ambulance on his dispatch radio.

""What did I do?"" Aderrien is said to have asked his mother after being shot. ""I don't want to die.""

He spent four days recovering in a local hospital, during which he was placed on a ventilator and given a chest tube.

Sharing his story for the first time in May with Good Morning America (GMA), the child described feeling like he had been struck by ""a big punch to the chest"".

He also said he had previously wanted to be a police officer but changed his mind after the shooting.

In a December GMA interview, Mr Capers, who is also black, said the shooting was ""spur of the moment"" and ""definitely wasn't intentional"".

National law enforcement statistics suggest domestic disturbance calls are dangerous for US police, often leading to officer assaults and even deaths. Experts say that puts them on high alert.

Carlos Moore, an attorney representing the Murry family, said in a statement that the video footage ""allows the world to independently assess whether the actions of Greg Capers were justified"".

After the MBI declined to release copies of Aderrien's 911 call, saying that it would violate state law, Mr Moore released the tapes himself on Thursday.

The five minutes of audio detail four separate 911 calls, including the first from Aderrien's grandmother and the one placed by the boy himself.

The tapes suggest that the 911 dispatcher may not have conveyed to Mr Capers and his colleague that there was a boy inside the house and it was he who called for help.

""The audio recordings reveal that one caller advised the police that no weapons were involved, and another caller advised that there was a child in the house,"" Mr Moore said in a statement to The Enterprise-Tocsin local newspaper.

""This crucial information should have been known to the responding officers and should have informed their approach to the situation.""

The city has so far declined to comment on either the video or audio releases.

The Murry family is currently suing the city and its police force for $5m (£3.9m).

The civil rights suit calls for Mr Capers and Indianola Police Chief Ronald Sampson to be fired.

It alleges the responding officers acted with gross negligence and reckless disregard ""so outrageous that it shocks the moral and legal conscience of the community"".","Aderrien Murry: Audio and video offer clues on shooting of boy, 11, by policeBy Sam Cabral BBC NewsCarlos Moore Law GroupAderrien Murry survived the shooting but suffered a collapsed lung, fractured rib and lacerated liverAttorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi.

All 10 victims of the Buffalo, New York shooting were black

The US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting.

The US Department of Justice, in a Biden administration first, said capital punishment is warranted due to the shooting's effect on victims.

Payton Gendron, 20, was sentenced to life in prison last year for the Buffalo, New York, shooting.

Gendron has said he killed people that day ""because they were black"".

The justice department outlined its arguments for the death penalty in a court filing on Friday. Under President Joe Biden, the federal government has not previously sought capital punishment and the longtime politician has stated his opposition to it.

But on Friday, the agency said in a court filing that the sentence was warranted because Gendron intentionally targeted the victims he killed and injured for their race when he opened fire at a grocery store on 14 May, 2022.

All 10 people who were killed in the shooting at a Buffalo supermarket were black. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86, and included eight grocery store shoppers, a store security guard and a church deacon that drove people to and from the store to do their shopping.

The gunman's actions that day were planned, premediated, and fuelled by his ""bias, hatred and contempt toward Black persons"", the agency's court filing says.

Merrick Garland, the US attorney general who leads the justice department, instituted a moratorium on federal executions pending a review of procedures in 2021. This court filing suggests that review has concluded.

New York state does not have capital punishment, but the gunman is facing hate crime and gun charges in a separate federal case. In those federal cases, the Justice Department can seek the death penalty.

Though her state banned capital punishment, Kathy Hochul - New York's governor - said she agreed with the decision.

""This complies with the DOJ requirements for what constitutes a death penalty offense,"" Ms Hochul said at a press conference on Friday.

Lawyers for the victims and families affected by the shooting said they welcomed the DOJ's request for the death penalty.

""Today's decision by the Department of Justice provides a pathway to both relief and a measure of closure for the victims and their families,"" the lawyers said. ""They have been pleading for full justice for nearly two years, and today they are one step closer.""

The gunman, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, had driven more than 320km (200 miles) across the state to a predominantly black neighbourhood before carrying out the attack.

He describes himself as a fascist and white supremacist in a 180-page document that he allegedly wrote before the shooting. He pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in 2022.

At his sentencing, the judge overseeing the case told the gunman that ""there is no place for you or your ignorant, hateful and evil ideologies in a civilized society"".","Buffalo: US seeks death penalty for gunman in racist shootingBy Nadine Yousif BBC NewsGetty ImagesAll 10 victims of the Buffalo, New York shooting were blackThe US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting.

US authorities are stepping up oversight of Boeing's manufacturing line a week after a door plug broke off one of its planes mid-flight.

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said he believed there were ""significant problems"" with the 737-9 Max jet as well as ""other manufacturing problems"".

The FAA said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line.

It also plans to review who is in charge of quality oversight.

For years, the FAA has delegated some parts of quality reviewing of planes to Boeing, but the practice has been controversial, drawing repeated warnings of safety risks.

""It is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,"" FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.

""The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system.""

Boeing did not immediately comment.

The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.

Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted.

Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed.

The blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries, has revived scrutiny.

Passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight have filed a class action lawsuit against Boeing. Their lawyers described the incident as a ""nightmare experience"" that had caused ""economic, physical and ongoing emotional consequences that have understandably deeply affected our clients"".

Mark Pegram, the father of Sam Pegram, an aid worker who died in the Ethiopian Airlines 2019 crash, said the emergency should make the government reconsider the deal it made with Boeing after the the earlier fatal accidents, in which the firm paid $2.5bn but may see its criminal charge dropped.

He also called for an independent industry monitor.

""The need for this independent oversight is even more necessary now when one considers the ineptness of the FAA which has failed again to properly oversee Boeing's Max aircraft production, as evidenced by these latest near catastrophes,"" he said.

""The lives of passengers should not needlessly, and once again, be put at risk.""

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating what happened on the Alaska Airlines plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks.

On Thursday, the FAA formally announced an inquiry into Boeing's processes.

It has also grounded 171 planes - most of the 737-9 Max fleet - with similar door plugs for inspections, which have revealed loose bolts and other issues.

Boeing has said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the probes. Supplier Spirit Aerosystems is also involved.

Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has already said the company will admit its ""mistake"" and has described the issue as a ""quality escape"".","Boeing: US regulator to increase oversight of firm after blowoutGetty ImagesUS authorities are stepping up oversight of Boeing's manufacturing line a week after a door plug broke off one of its planes mid-flight.

Watch: The biggest takeaways from Trump’s fraud trial… in 82 seconds

Appearing in court in New York at the end of the civil fraud case against the Trump Organization on Thursday, Donald Trump insisted on having his say.

The judge had previously said the former president would not be able to speak in the courtroom but eventually relented and gave him a few minutes.

He used that platform to accuse the city's attorney general of hating him before striding out of the courtroom and declaring the case a ""sham"" to waiting reporters.

But that wasn't enough. A full news conference followed at a building he owns - and is accused of fraudulently valuing - at 40 Wall Street down the road.

Mr Trump is treating his court appearances as though they are campaign events, blending his legal defence with his re-election bid as a US presidential race like no other kicks into high gear.

His legal headaches across the country are, in his telling, all part of a plan by Joe Biden, the Democrats and the White House to stop him winning the 2024 election.

Thursday's appearance in New York followed hot on the heels of another in Washington earlier in the week. The former president made a personal appearance at a federal appeals court where his lawyers argued that he could not be tried for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.

As his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination have been criss-crossing Iowa ahead of the first voting contest on Monday, the former president has been claiming that he is being dragged off the campaign trail by the judiciary.

""TWICE in this final week, I will reportedly be forced off the campaign trail and into courtrooms for phony witch hunts in both New York and Washington DC,"" he wrote in a fundraising email to supporters.

In fact, he did not have to attend either of these hearings. He deliberately chose to appear in two separate courtrooms because he believes that his campaign gets a significant boost every time he is seen in court.

And he's right. The Republican frontrunner has successfully transformed his multiple legal problems into his greatest political asset. At rallies, news conferences and in emails and text messages to voters and donors, he claims to be the victim of politically motivated prosecutions orchestrated to try to stop him getting back into the White House.

The indictments against him, he tells supporters, aren't a source of shame but a ""badge of honour"". He claims the various cases he faces are not just an effort to target him but also the 50% or so of America that supports him. A familiar line from his political stump speech is: ""They are not after me. They're after you. I'm just standing in their way.""

That framing of 91 criminal charges - a charge sheet that would have long sunk any ordinary candidate - has proved to be a very effective way of drawing his base into this battle right alongside him.

It has given the Trump campaign a mission and a purpose ahead of what looks like a likely rematch against President Joe Biden in November. Mr Trump's legal travails also help to ensure his campaign machinery is greased with the right amount of cash.

His bid for re-election only started to build momentum after the first criminal indictment against him in New York last April.

Trump has repeatedly claimed his legal troubles are an attempt by Democrats to take down his campaign

Fundraising emails were sent just minutes after news of the charges related to hush money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels broke in the media. More than $4m (£3.1m) was reportedly raised in the following 24 hours.

After his second indictment in June - on federal criminal changes of mishandling classified documents - the money again poured in. Some $6.6m in a matter of days was reported to have been raised by his campaign.

By the time that iconic mugshot was taken when he was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in August - on charges of plotting to overturn the state's 2020 election results - he had perfected the art of making a spectacle out of each indictment.

The campaign brought TV crews with him on his private plane and inside his motorcade to broadcast his every move, live.

Speaking in Washington this week, he claimed that he was only being prosecuted because opinion polls show he is currently leading President Biden. According to most polls, the race is neck and neck.

""I think they feel this is the way they are going to try to and win, and that's not the way it goes,"" Mr Trump said. He predicted there would be ""bedlam"" in the country if the criminal cases against him prevented his re-election.

The White House has been on the counter-offensive. President Biden used his first major speech of this year on 6 January to warn of the fundamental threat he says Mr Trump poses to American democracy.

This argument - which leans heavily on reminding Americans of what happened when Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol three years ago- will be a major plank of the Democrat's campaign, which is otherwise struggling to cut through on its positive message about the US economy and that inflation is coming down.

But Mr Trump has already turned the argument on its head for his supporters. In Trump's world, Mr Biden is ""the true destroyer of democracy"".

But the mood - particularly among independents - may change when any of the trials Mr Trump is facing actually get under way.

The 6 January case is particularly perilous for the former president. Voters will hear detailed evidence about how Mr Trump tried to cling on to power after losing the 2020 election. Polls suggest a conviction in that case - and the potential implication of prison time - could become a significant political disadvantage.

But Mr Trump has a strategy for that too. Delay, delay and delay with as many motions and appeals as possible to try and make sure no trial begins until after the election on 5 November.","""I think they feel this is the way they are going to try to and win, and that's not the way it goes,"" Mr Trump said.

Watch: Rapper Jelly Roll urges Congress to take action on US fentanyl crisis

Rapper and country artist Jelly Roll, who at one time sold drugs, is now urging Congress to pass anti-fentanyl legislation that targets traffickers.

The two-time Grammy nominee, whose real name is Jason DeFord, acknowledged on Thursday the role he once played in the crisis.

But he told lawmakers he has also personally seen the devastation drugs are causing across the US.

""I've attended more funerals than I care to share with y'all,"" he said.

""I could sit here and cry for days about the caskets I've carried of people I love dearly, deeply, in my soul.""

Fentanyl is a leading killer in the US - contributing to over 100,000 deaths in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six out of 10 fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills contain a lethal dose of fentanyl, the US Drug Enforcement Administration found.

The Country Music Award winner urged legislators in the Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to pass the bill, which would enforce financial sanctions against drug traffickers to disrupt the flow of the drugs coming from Mexico and China.

DeFord said it is time to ""proactive"", not ""reactive"" towards the crisis.

Though he was lobbying for legislation put forward by Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, he said this was a bipartisan issue.

He said: ""I truly believe in my heart that this bill will stop the supply and can help stop the supply of fentanyl.""

In his testimony, DeFord said 190 people on average die a day from a fentanyl overdose.

He asked Congress: ""Could you imagine the national media attention it would get if they were reporting that a plane was crashing every single day and killing 190 people?""

""But because it's 190 drug addicts, we don't feel that way,"" DeFord said, adding that society has been known to ""bully and shame drug addicts"".

From the age of 14, DeFord ran into trouble with law, spending 10 years in and out of detention facilities for drug-related crimes.

""I believed when I sold drugs, genuinely, that selling drugs was a victimless crime,"" DeFord said.

""I brought my community down. I hurt people. I was the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about, just like these drug dealers are doing right now when they're mixing every drug on the market with fentanyl. And they're killing the people we love,"" he told senators.","Country artist Jelly Roll pushes for anti-fentanyl billBy Chloe Kim BBC News, New YorkWatch: Rapper Jelly Roll urges Congress to take action on US fentanyl crisisRapper and country artist Jelly Roll, who at one time sold drugs, is now urging Congress to pass anti-fentanyl legislation that targets traffickers.

President Lula has pledged to end deforestation in the Amazon by 2030

The rate of deforestation in Brazil's Amazon fell by nearly 50% in 2023 compared to the previous year, space agency data suggests.

Brazil's environment ministry said it was the lowest recorded deforestation rate in the last five years.

Though smaller than in previous years, the deforested area is still more than six times the size of New York City.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva pledged to end deforestation by 2030 when he took office a year ago.

Preliminary data from national space agency Inpe showed 5,153 sq km (1,989.6 sq miles) of the Amazon were cleared in 2023, down from 10,278 sq km in 2022.

President Lula promised to restore the Amazon rainforest and chase down climate criminals during his speech at climate summit COP27 in 2022.

Watch: Fighter jets strike targets in Yemen

It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened.

Hopes for containing what is happening rest on the fact that it is still relatively low-level, compared to the worst-case scenarios of regional war.

The US and British attacks on the Houthis in Yemen are not just, as ministers in London have suggested, about the freedom of navigation and world trade.

They are directly linked to events in Gaza and represent an escalation of the crisis that is gripping the region.

The Houthis immediately vowed to respond. It is also entirely possible that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria will increase the action they are taking against the American forces in the region.

If that theatre heats up more, and US forces retaliate, it will be harder for the American diplomacy effort to avert all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political movement backed by Iran.

The Houthis are also part of the network of allies and proxies, the so-called axis of resistance, that Iran has constructed to give it forward defence against its enemies.

They are getting increasingly sophisticated weapons from Iran, but it is best to think of them as allies rather than Tehran's proxy.

I have spent quite a bit of time with the Houthis in Yemen and they are people who are highly independently minded. They will relish conflict with the Americans. They want to be part of this war. What has been happening suits both the Houthis and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Houthi supporters demonstrate on Friday after the US and UK air strikes

Iran has beefed up their capabilities and the kind of firepower that the Houthis have at their disposal. That includes anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles they have fired at Israel as well as attack drones - the same sort that Iran supplies to Russia to use against Ukraine. They are well-armed.

It is nothing like the naval capacity that they are facing from the US, UK and other members of the coalition the Americans have assembled in the Red Sea. But the threat the Houthis pose is less about the physical damage they might cause and more about the danger to international navigation.

In December, they hijacked a ship and forced it into one of their ports. They have also fired directly at ships and caused some damage, although they have not sunk any vessels.

Commercial shipping companies who want to get their valuable cargoes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the mouth of Red Sea do not want to have hostile forces firing at them. Because of the risks, the insurance costs will rocket, and that's why so many companies are now choosing to detour along the west coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, the shortcut between Asia and Europe that routes ships down the Red Sea and through Bab al-Mandab.

The Houthis have controlled Sanaa, Yemen's capital, and big parts of the country including the Red Sea coast since 2014. In 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition, also including the United Arab Emirates, that went to war to try to overthrow them.

The Saudis said the intervention in Yemen's civil war was to re-establish the country's legitimate and internationally recognised government, which the Houthis had overthrown.

But a few days after the intervention started, I spoke to very senior Saudis who told me it was to stop Iran from operating in their back yard. Yemen has a frontier with Saudi Arabia.

The Houthis were then bombed by the Saudis from 2015 until the ceasefire came in over a year ago, so a fresh round of strikes is unlikely to intimidate them - they are used to it.

I don't think one single round of air strikes is going to do more than make them think yes, we are on the right track. They want to be seen as a fearless resistance to America and its Western allies, who also back Israel.

The Houthis have said that they are carrying out these attacks in the Red Sea because of the war in Gaza, the killing of civilians and the severe privations Israel has imposed by blocking all but a fraction of the food and relief supplies that they need to survive.

They have said that if the war in Gaza ended and if supplies were permitted to enter, then they wouldn't be threatening a major international shipping lane.

Some critics of the American and British support for Israel say that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would be a much better way to stop the Houthi attacks than bombing them. If Houthi attacks continued after a ceasefire, the argument is that air strikes against them would have increased legitimacy.

There is the possibility that this US-UK action could prolong or escalate the situation with the Houthis, rather than shutting it down. Last November, when the Houthis made their first moves in the wider Gaza war with their first attacks on merchant shipping off the Yemen coast, I spoke to Mohammed Ali Al Houthi, one of the leading members of their organisation. He was very defiant then and I am absolutely certain the Houthis will continue to be defiant now.

They will want to carry out more attacks, to show that they are defiant and unbeaten.

The US and UK attacks hit many different locations. While it is not possible to know the Houthis' precise military capacity, it seems unlikely that one round of strikes will have taken it out.

Houthi fighters pictured in Sanaa yesterday

Regular bombardment by the Saudis since 2015 did not appear to have had a significant impact on their capacity. Yemen is a mountainous country. Given their experience of being bombed it is likely they will have tried to hide things away. Iran presumably has sent advisers and trainers to Yemen to help them operate the weapons they have supplied, and they too will have thought about ways of surviving attacks.

We can gauge the way that Iran has upgraded the Houthi arsenal by looking at the kind of weapons they are firing out of Yemen. They are more sophisticated, more lethal and therefore more of a threat.

When the Houthis took over a merchant ship last month, video of their attack showed well-trained commandoes landing from a helicopter. They are more formidable than the images we often see on TV, of groups of raggedly dressed men waving Kalashnikovs.

Compared to the force the US and UK can wield there is no comparison, but that isn't the point in this kind of warfare.

If the Houthis, who have supporters across the region, are able to continue to threaten and fire on ships in some way then they will signal to their followers that they are not bowed by the West.","Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spreadBy Jeremy Bowen BBC international editorWatch: Fighter jets strike targets in YemenIt is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East.

The Houthis released images showing their fighters hijacking a vessel in the Red Sea on 21 November

Drone and rocket attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have now prompted US and UK-led forces to stage air strikes on targets in the region.

Western forces took action after vessels were attacked by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group which controls a large part of Yemen.

US President Joe Biden said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes early on Friday against Houthi targets with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.

More than 12 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold, were hit. The Houthi targets in Yemen included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots.

Why have the Houthis attacked Red Sea ships?

The attacks began after the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.

The Houthis declared their support for Hamas and said they would target any ship travelling to Israel. It is not clear that all of the ships attacked were actually heading there.

In November they seized what they said was an Israeli cargo ship.

They since have attacked several commercial vessels with drones and ballistic missiles.

Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.

Major shipping firms including Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and the oil company BP have all said they are diverting vessels away from the Red Sea.

The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia.

Washington has accused Iran of being ""deeply involved"" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

More on the US-UK strikes in Yemen

Who are the Houthis?

The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They take their name from the movement's founder, Hussein al Houthi.

Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the group was formed in the 1990s to combat what they saw as the corruption of the then president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.

President Saleh, backed by Saudi Arabia's military, tried to eliminate the Houthi rebels in 2003, but the Houthis repelled them both.

Reuters

The Houthis have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government. The government has been backed against the Houthis by a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

By the start of 2022, the war had caused an estimated 377,000 deaths and displaced four million people, according to the UN.

The Houthis declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and the wider West - along with Hamas and Hezbollah.

Who backs the Houthis?

The Houthis model themselves on the Shia armed group in Lebanon, Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has been providing them with extensive military expertise and training since 2014, according to the US research institute, the Combating Terrorism Center.

The Houthis also consider Iran as an ally, because Saudi Arabia is their common enemy.

Iran is suspected of supplying the Houthis with weapons, and the US says Iranian intelligence is critical to enabling them to target ships.

""We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,"" White House national security spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

""This is consistent with Iran's long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis' destabilizing actions in the region.""

Iran denies involvement in attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea.

Wreckage of a drone fired from Yemen at the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi in 2022

The US and Saudi Arabia says Iran supplied the ballistic missiles which the Houthis fired at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, but which were shot down.

Saudi Arabia also blamed Iran for supplying the cruise missiles and drones that the Houthis used to attack Saudi oil installations in 2019.

The Houthis have fired ten of thousands of short-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, and have also attacked targets in the UAE. They have also fired ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel since the start of the war in Gaza.

Supplying these weapons would breach a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied doing so.

How much of Yemen do the Houthis control?

The official government of Yemen is the Presidential Leadership Council, to which President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi transferred his powers in April 2022.

However, the government is based in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after Hadi fled there in 2015.

Most of the Yemeni population lives in areas under Houthi control. As well as Sanaa and the north of Yemen, the Houthis control the Red Sea coastline.

The group collects taxes and also prints money.","Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking Red Sea ships?

By Lora Jones, Jonathan Josephs & Faisal Islam BBC News

Oil prices jumped by 4% after the US and UK launched strikes in Yemen over recent attacks by Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea.

Brent crude hit $80 per barrel for the first time this year as the Iran-backed rebels vowed to retaliate against military action by Western powers.

While the price rose, it is below highs reached when Russia invaded Ukraine.

But the UK government has drawn up scenarios suggesting further disruption could hit the economy.

The BBC understands the Treasury has modelled outcomes including crude oil prices rising by more than $10 a barrel and a 25% increase in natural gas.

On Friday, Brent Crude - the international benchmark for oil prices for much of the world - hit $80.71 per barrel before easing, while US West Texas crude increased by 2.79% to $74.03.

The UK government is concerned that ongoing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea could weigh on the UK economy, where growth remains fragile.

Higher energy prices risk stoking inflation just as it has begun to slow. Meanwhile, the cost of shipping containers on vessels has jumped, meaning that companies could choose to pass on this expense to consumers.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that the attacks had caused ""major disruption to a vital trade route and [higher] commodity prices"".

But Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, pointed out that energy prices are still considerably lower than they were four months ago.

""At these levels, it is actually quite disinflationary for the UK economy,"" he said.

He added that when the Bank of England comes to make its next interest rate decision in February, oil prices are still likely to be some 20% lower than they were in the autumn.

More on the US-UK strikes in Yemen

Houthi rebels in Yemen have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The US said there had been 27 attacks in the Red Sea since mid-November.

The group has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.

Ships usually take this key trade route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. Many companies are now sending vessels around the Cape of Good Hope instead, a route that adds at least 10 days of travel.

On Friday, shipping data showed that at least four oil tankers changed course since the overnight strikes by the US and the UK.

Danish fuel tanker giant Torm also said that it had stopped allowing its fleet to sail through the southern Red Sea, while Intertanko, which represents nearly 70% of all internationally traded oil, gas and chemical tankers, is currently urging its members to avoid the Bal al-Mandab straight for several days and turn off their transmitters.

Currently, about a quarter of the world's shipping containers are being diverted.

According to the White House, about 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea. This includes 8% of global grain, 12% of seaborne oil and 8% of the world's liquified natural gas.

Vincent Clerc, chief executive of Maersk, the shipping giant, told the BBC that ""significant disruption"" to global trade was already being felt ""down to the end consumer"".

Several companies have said they have already seen, or are expecting, a knock-on effect:

Carmaker Stellantis is using some airfreight solutions to avoid disruption

Tesla has suspended most car production at its Berlin plant

Volvo Cars will pause production for three days next week at its plant in Ghent, Belgium

Tesco's boss has warned it ""could inflate the cost of some items""

Next has said delays to deliveries could arise

Ikea has said supplies could be affected

Danone has said transit times for its shipments have increased

The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, although it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel.

As a result of the attacks, Maersk and several of the world's other major shipping lines have been avoiding a key route for global trade as they prioritise the safety of their crews.

""We have ships that are being shot at. We have colleagues whose lives are at risk when this happens and we can simply not justify sailing through these danger zones the way the situation is right now,"" Mr Clerc said.

He said the longer route around Africa was sucking capacity out of the global shipping system in the short term, adding anything from seven days to two weeks to a ship's journey, as well as costing $1m (£783,000) more in fuel alone.

Rates for moving cargo by sea reached record highs during the pandemic. Since the attacks on vessels started in the region, prices for both container transport and that of goods have again surged.

According to the Drewry World Container Index, pricing for a 40ft container hit $3,072 on 11 January, prior to the US and UK strikes carried out on Houthi targets in Yemen.

In Bahrain on a tour of the Middle East this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said extra costs get ""translated into higher prices for people, for everything from fuel to medicine to food"".","Oil prices rise on US-UK strikes over Red Sea attacksBy Lora Jones, Jonathan Josephs & Faisal Islam BBC NewsGetty ImagesOil prices jumped by 4% after the US and UK launched strikes in Yemen over recent attacks by Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea.

Both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden cited the global economic impact of Houthi attacks on Red Sea cargo ships in overnight statements as the reasoning behind military action.

The Treasury has modelled scenarios suggesting that disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the UK economy, risking a recession.

The main fear in the Treasury's analyses is of a rise of at least $10 per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas.

Rises such as these have not actually materialised, so far, mainly because of the actions of Saudi Arabia - the major oil producing nation - in soothing global energy markets with price cuts.

The US and UK will hope that their overnight strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels will help reverse widespread delays and disruption to Red Sea trading routes, by re-establishing safe passage through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait into the Suez Canal.

But, on the other hand, there is now also a clear pathway of escalation to a wider Middle East conflict.

Oil prices had fallen quite significantly before this, helping petrol prices drop below £1.40 a litre to a two-year low. And on Friday, while prices rose by 4%, they are still a relatively manageable $80 per barrel.

But disruption to cargo traffic risks spreading from the Red Sea across the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz, another key trading route.

On Thursday, Iran's navy seized a US-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of a long-running row between the two nations.

If that situation also escalates, another energy shock is possible with the risk of $100 per barrel of oil on the horizon - just as the impact of the Ukraine crisis was fading.

Meanwhile, Europe is now much more physically dependent on flows of shipped gas from Qatar, after supplies from Russian pipelines were stopped.

European energy majors have been queuing up to do deals with Doha after Russian taps were turned off.

Even if physical supplies could be made up from the US - now the world largest exporter of liquified natural gas - the price would surge on any disruption in the Gulf.

A serious escalation could further disrupt the global economy, entrenching inflation, just as the world's central banks were pondering turning points and cutting interest rates.

It would also mark clear parallels with the 1970s, when two separate geopolitical energy shocks from the Arab-Israeli War and the Iranian Revolution led to prolonged inflation over several years.","Is the economy facing another energy price shock?

By Georgina Rannard Science reporter, BBC News

Stephen Rostain

Scientists found evidence of 6,000 mounds thought to be the basis for ancient homes

A huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.

The discovery changes what we know about the history of people living in the Amazon.

The houses and plazas in the Upano area in eastern Ecuador were connected by an astounding network of roads and canals.

The area lies in the shadow of a volcano that created rich local soils but also may have led to the destruction of the society.

While we knew about cities in the highlands of South America, like Machu Picchu in Peru, it was believed that people only lived nomadically or in tiny settlements in the Amazon.

""This is older than any other site we know in the Amazon. We have a Eurocentric view of civilisation, but this shows we have to change our idea about what is culture and civilisation,"" says Prof Stephen Rostain, director of investigation at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, who led the research.

""It changes the way we see Amazonian cultures. Most people picture small groups, probably naked, living in huts and clearing land - this shows ancient people lived in complicated urban societies,"" says co-author Antoine Dorison.

The city was built around 2,500 years ago, and people lived there for up to 1,000 years, according to archaeologists.

It is difficult to accurately estimate how many people lived there at any one time, but scientists say it is certainly in the 10,000s if not 100,000s.

The archaeologists combined ground excavations with a survey of a 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area using laser sensors flown on a plane that could identify remains of the city beneath the dense plants and trees.

This LiDAR technology found 6,000 rectangular platforms measuring about 20m (66 ft) by 10m (33 ft) and 2-3m high.

They were arranged in groups of three to six units around a plaza with a central platform.

The scientists believe many were homes, but some were for ceremonial purposes. One complex, at Kilamope, included a 140m (459 ft) by 40m (131 ft) platform.

They were built by cutting into hills and creating a platform of earth on top.

Stephen Rostain

Roads, paths and canals were found connecting the platforms suggesting a large area was occupied

A network of straight roads and paths connected many of the platforms, including one that extended 25km (16 miles).

Dr Dorison said these roads were the most striking part of the research.

""The road network is very sophisticated. It extends over a vast distance, everything is connected. And there are right angles, which is very impressive,"" he says, explaining that it is much harder to build a straight road than one that fits in with the landscape.

He believes some had a ""very powerful meaning"", perhaps linked to a ceremony or belief.

The scientists also identified causeways with ditches on either side which they believe were canals that helped manage the abundant water in the region.

There were signs of threats to the cities - some ditches blocked entrances to the settlements, and may be evidence of threats from nearby people.

Researchers first found evidence of a city in the 1970s, but this is the first time a comprehensive survey has been completed, after 25 years of research.

It reveals a large, complex society that appears to be even bigger than the well-known Mayan societies in Mexico and Central America.

""Imagine that you discovered another civilisation like the Maya, but with completely different architecture, land use, ceramics,"" says José Iriarte, a professor of archaeology at University of Exeter, who was not involved in this research.

Some of the findings are ""unique"" for South America, he explains, pointing to the octagonal and rectangular platforms arranged together.

The societies were clearly well-organised and interconnected, he says, highlighting the long sunken roads between settlements.

Not a huge amount is known about the people who lived there and what their societies were like.

Pits and hearths were found in the platforms, as well as jars, stones to grind plants and burnt seeds.

The Kilamope and Upano people living there probably mostly focussed on agriculture. People ate maize and sweet potato, and probably drank ""chicha"", a type of sweet beer.

Prof Rostain says he was warned against this research at the start of his career because scientists believed no ancient groups had lived in the Amazon.

""But I'm very stubborn, so I did it anyway. Now I must admit I am quite happy to have made such a big discovery,"" he says.","Huge ancient lost city found in the AmazonBy Georgina Rannard Science reporter, BBC NewsStephen RostainScientists found evidence of 6,000 mounds thought to be the basis for ancient homesA huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.

By Hugh Schofield BBC News, Paris

Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin (L), pictured with the new PM, was a protégé of Nicolas Sarkozy

France's youngest ever PM Gabriel Attal has kept on most of the heavyweights from the outgoing government.

But his cabinet - named on Thursday - also contains some interesting new faces.

Mr Attal's own former partner Stéphane Séjourné is at foreign affairs, while Sarkozy-era minister Rachida Dati is at culture.

The cabinet's profile is clearly more skewed to the right than previous ones under President Emmanuel Macron.

Gone it seems is the careful preservation of left-right balance. Today the only members of the government with a past in the Socialist Party (PS) are Mr Attal himself and Mr Séjourné (though Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti also has been identified with the left in the past).

Among those who came to Mr Macron from the centre-right Republicans (LR) are Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu - all of whom keep their posts.

To their number is now added 58-year-old Rachida Dati, who rose to fame as a young minister of justice under President Sarkozy in 2007.

Outspoken and petite, Ms Dati is held up more often than she would like as an exemplar of French Republican integration. One of 11 children born to a Moroccan-Algerian couple in Chalon-sur-Saône, she battled her way to the top by force of personality.

Currently she is mayor of the expensive 7th arrondissement of Paris, which includes most government buildings, and which she has used as a springboard for her avowed ambition to be the next mayor of Paris.

Reuters

Stéphane Séjourné and Rachida Dati are among the new names in Mr Attal's cabinet

Political insiders were knocked backwards by news of her appointment at culture, because she was not seen as a particular friend of the government. She once said Macronites were all traitors - either from the left or from the right.

Now that she has performed her own mini-betrayal, Ms Dati's membership of LR has been suspended. But her recruitment is a coup for Mr Attal. She is a familiar face among the French who - in general - admire her chutzpah.

Less familiar and less exciting a personality, but occupying a more important role, is Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné.

Any thumbnail sketch of the 38-year-old is bound to start with the fact that he was for more than five years the partner of Mr Attal.

In 2017, the two Macron-loyalists were joined by a civil partnership (PACS). Mr Attal is France's first openly gay PM. Mr Séjourné attended key meetings at the Elysée while Mr Attal as government spokesman was at the heart of policy-making at the prime minister's office - making them the supreme Macronite power-couple.

Such is the importance attached to the non-reporting of public people's private lives in France, it was only this week that we learned that their PACS was dissolved in 2022.

Brought up in Madrid and Buenos Aires, Mr Séjourné was an early adopter of Macronism and helped set up the president's LREM party. He was an Elysée adviser before becoming an MEP in 2019 and heading the centrist bloc in the EU parliament, Renew.

More than his predecessor Catherine Colonna, he will enjoy the confidence of President Macron - which is as well because it is the president who sets foreign policy anyway.

Catherine Vautrin, 63-year-old president of the greater Reims metropolitan area, takes over as a new super-minister of health and labour. She is another defector from the right, having served as a junior minister under President Chirac.

Some will recall that Ms Vautrin voted against gay marriage in 2013, though she has since said she regretted not seeing how society was changing.","Mr Attal's own former partner Stéphane Séjourné is at foreign affairs, while Sarkozy-era minister Rachida Dati is at culture.

Two sisters caught four care workers abusing their 89-year-old grandmother after hiding a camera in her bedroom.

Danielle Hinsley and her sister Rebecca became suspicious after Beryl Wall's behaviour changed and she began to get bruises on her face and wrists.

Like a scene from the hugely popular Netflix drama Fool Me Once, they put a photo frame with a hidden camera in her room at a care home in Wolverhampton.

Four days of footage from February 2020 was enough to convict her attackers.

It caught the workers shouting in dementia sufferer Mrs Wall's face, making fun of her, holding her legs in the air and hitting her in the face with a pillow.

Danielle Hinsley

It was these bruises on Mrs Wall's face that made her granddaughters get the hidden camera

Ame Tunkara, Morounranti Adefila, Danny Ohen and Bridget Aideyan were jailed at the end of 2023.

""Knowing they spent Christmas and new year away from their families is the best punishment,"" Danielle said.

The sisters saw their grandmother regularly so quickly spotted her decline.

""We visited nan every day as this happened before lockdown,"" Danielle said.

""Her behaviour had changed, she had bruises. So I went home and ordered a picture frame camera off Amazon and put a picture of me, my sister and my nan in it.""

Danielle Hinsley

Mrs Wall's family shared images of care home workers being abusive caught on the hidden camera

It is the same type of camera millions of viewers have seen actress Michelle Keegan use in Fool Me Once, which is currently Netflix's number one drama worldwide.

It is given to her to keep an eye on her daughter's nanny, but captures more than she is expecting.

Naked and confused

When Danielle viewed the footage several days later, she said it ""broke my heart"".

It captured the people who should have been caring for her most mocking Mrs Wall and pinching her face.

In much of the footage their grandmother was naked and confused, Danielle said.

The sisters took their evidence to the care home managers, the Care Quality Commission and West Midlands Police.

Three of the four workers were from an agency and one was a permanent member of staff.

Danielle Hinsley

Mrs Wall's behaviour changed from being happy to being distressed

Ohen was on his first shift at the home when he was caught on camera intimidating Mrs Wall and hitting her in the face with a pillow.

The family does not want to name the care home, which is under new management and whose other staff had been ""amazing"", they said, caring for Mrs Wall until she died in October last year.

""We believe nan waited for the trial to end because she took a turn quite quickly when we told her the verdict,"" Danielle said.

""She was my everything and always will be my everything.""

West Midlands Police

Ame Tunkara (left) and Bridget Aideyan were jailed for four months

In total, eight care workers were charged for abusing Mrs Wall but only four were found guilty.

Tunkara, 33, of Walsall, and Adefila, 43, of Wolverhampton, were found guilty of ill-treatment and wilful neglect and sentenced in December to four months in prison.

Ohen, 39, and Aideyan, 49, both from Wolverhampton, were also found guilty of the same offences and sentenced to six months and four months, respectively.

West Midlands Police

Many people abstain from drinking to kick off the year. Non-alcoholic cocktails are a growing option – yet they're more than just a substitute for the temporarily sober.

For Chicago comedian Kristi Durkin, 1 January ushered in a wave of new year's excitement – and a 31-day alcohol-free challenge. ""Everyone on the internet is going sober,"" jokes Durkin. ""Everyone is drinking, like, tart cherry juice, and I'm really susceptible to internet trends.""

Durkin, 26, has latched onto Dry January, an annual challenge popularised by advocacy group Alcohol Change UK. Each January, participants commit to a month without alcohol, ostensibly to ""dry out"" after the holidays, and explore the merits of a sober lifestyle

In contrast with past years, Dry January doesn't necessarily mean fully ditching swanky mixed drinks. There are many non-alcoholic options on the market, particularly in cans, as the ""mocktail"" market surges.

US demand for non-alcoholic canned cocktails grew by 4% year over year, according to a study from Amsterdam-based behavioural research company Veylinx, seen by the BBC. Even big brands want in on the boom; last year, US beverage company Molson-Coors launched its first non-alcoholic cocktail, a canned concoction called Roxie. Meanwhile, a swath of emerging companies are offering upscale botanical spirits without alcohol.

Some emphasise flavour, like California-based Ghia. Launched in 2020, the company serves up an artfully designed, booze-free apéritif with a ""vibrant, fresh and satisfyingly bitter"" taste meant to appeal to people who want a complex alternative to a cocktail – something more sophisticated than, say, a diet cola.

Other brands look to substitute alcohol for purported benefits, promising nutritional or mood-boosting enhancements. This is the slant of Kin Euphorics, a brand co-founded by American supermodel Bella Hadid, which touts ""natural ingredients that nourish the mind and body"".

Yet for all the options, Dry January participants may not be making a one-for-one swap from cocktails to mocktails, says Michael Bevan, head of marketing for Veylinx. The imbibers going sober for a month may be less interested in shifting to alternatives, and more interested in muscling through a month without alcohol.

""I don't need something that tastes like alcohol to trick myself,"" says Durkin. She says she'd rather save money and drink a fizzy non-alcoholic seltzer like Topo Chico in place of alcohol. ""It's more about putting something in my hand to sip.""

Along with consumer tastes during a month of abstention, one barrier to mocktail adoption may be the cost. For those who see Dry January as a way to save money, they may not be the best option.

Ghia's Apéritif Duo, which includes two 500ml bottles, retails online for $75 (£59); in contrast, a 750ml bottle of Aperol, an alcoholic apéritif, runs about $30 (£24). Beyond canned cocktails, another emerging category in non-alcoholic alternatives is spirits. California-based Monday, which makes zero-alcohol whiskey, mezcal, gin and rum, offers a Dry January pack of four bottles for $172 (£135), discounted to $130 (£102) as of this writing. (These high prices are not always the case – non-alcoholic beer from multinational beverage company The Athletic is priced comparably to other craft brews.)

Some industry experts, however, say the point of high-end mocktails isn't to offer a direct swap for alcoholic cocktails, or to be a budget option – whether during Dry January or in general.

Hector Diaz, the co-founder of In Good Spirits, a non-alcoholic bar and bottle shop in Chicago, suggests that these drinks are more about inclusivity. ""It's less about replacing [alcohol] entirely and more about filling a need,"" says Diaz. ""A lot of consumers that don't drink in general have lacked options in the past, and for them to have them now is really great.""

Come February, Dry January practitioners may head back to alcohol, whether they're spending on canned cocktails, spirits or other beers, but Diaz is happy if the experiment teaches them something about their habits and attitudes around drinking.

""A lot of folks [visiting our store] aren't necessarily going to stop drinking alcohol, but they want to be more intentional about their choices – even if that means they're taking a quick break from alcohol during a night of drinking,"" says Diaz. ""It's all about balancing themselves out.""","Do mocktails scratch the Dry January itch?

Roberts said she's ""very forthright"" in expressing her views on film sets

Julia Roberts has said she has made the choice not to do nude scenes throughout her 35-year film career.

""You know, not criticising others' choices, but for me to not take off my clothes in a movie or be vulnerable in physical ways is a choice that I guess I make for myself,"" she said.

The actress, interviewed by Notting Hill writer and director Richard Curtis for British Vogue, also said she nearly didn't take the film's starring role.

""Honestly, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was your movie, playing a movie actress,"" she told him.

""I was so uncomfortable! I mean, we've talked about this so many times, but I almost didn't take the part because it just seemed - oh, it just seemed so awkward. I didn't even know how to play that person.""

The star was also asked if she chose roles that represented her views on feminism.

""It would be more to the point that the things I choose not to do are representative of me,"" she replied.

She added: ""But in effect, I'm choosing not to do something as opposed to choosing to do something.""

Roberts said she'd had a ""G-rated career"" - referring to the US film rating for movies suitable for a general audience.

Roberts shot to fame opposite Richard Gere in Pretty Woman

She had a body double for revealing scenes as a prostitute in 1990's Pretty Woman, and has previously spoken about asking for an explicit sex scene in 2009's Duplicity to be changed.

""It's not really what I do, so if you're going to ask me to do it, you have to expect it to be toned down. You know, as a mum of three, I feel like that,"" she was reported to have said at the time.

She also once said: ""I wouldn't do nudity in films. To act with my clothes on is a performance. To act with my clothes off is a documentary.""

'I speak plainly'

During the new Vogue interview, Curtis said there was a ""tough side"" to Roberts.

""I think I speak very plainly,"" the Oscar winner responded. ""That's kind of how I see myself. I'm very forthright.

""There are a lot of personalities in the world that don't accept that easily, and it can seem really harsh, even if I feel like I'm just being honest about something and just saying, 'This is how I see it'. I never am trying to be unkind.""

Roberts almost turned down her role in 1999's Notting Hill

She recalled that she ""loathed"" a costume that had been chosen for her to wear in a key scene in Notting Hill, so decided to send her driver back to her flat to fetch her own clothes for her to wear instead.

""It was my own flip-flops and my cute little blue velvet skirt and a T-shirt and my cardigan.""

Roberts was interviewed for Vogue by Richard Curtis

Roberts also said young film stars have a more ""exhausting"" and ""chaotic"" time now compared with the late 1980s and early 90s, when she made her name.

""I don't know if it's better [today], because it's not my experience, but it just seems very different,"" she said. ""And in a way, it seems so cluttered. There are so many elements to being famous now, it just seems exhausting.

""Whereas I feel like, and again this is just my perception, because I don't really know - I'm not a young person starting out in show business in the 21st Century - but it seems to me that it was: you meet people, you read for parts, you try to get jobs, you get a job, you try to do a good job, and from that job, you might meet some new people who might suggest you to some other people and then you might get another job and you might get paid a little bit more for that job, and it might be a little bit of a better job.","Julia Roberts says she has made the choice not to do nude scenesBy Ian Youngs Entertainment & arts reporterGetty ImagesRoberts said she's ""very forthright"" in expressing her views on film setsJulia Roberts has said she has made the choice not to do nude scenes throughout her 35-year film career.

By Jemma Dempsey BBC News

HelloFresh

The ICO found HelloFresh had sent millions of spam emails and texts over a seven-month period

Food delivery company HelloFresh has been fined for sending millions of spam emails and texts to customers.

The recipe box firm was told to pay £140,000 following a 2022 investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

It found 79 million emails and one million texts were sent out over a seven-month spamming campaign.

The ICO said it marked a ""clear breach of trust"". HelloFresh said it had made changes to its SMS and email policy.

Investigations began in March 2022 after 14 complaints were made directly to the regulator, and another 8,729 were made to the 7726 spam message reporting service.

The ICO found HelloFresh continued to contact some individuals even after they had asked it to stop.

'Barrage of texts'

It also found customers were not given enough information that their data would be used for marketing for up to 24 months after cancelling their subscriptions.

""This marked a clear breach of trust of the public by HelloFresh,"" said Andy Curry, head of investigations at the ICO.

""Customers weren't told exactly what they'd be opting into, nor was it clear how to opt out. From there, they were hit with a barrage of marketing texts they didn't want or expect, and in some cases, even when they told HelloFresh to stop, the deluge continued.""

The ICO said the fine showed ""clear and decisive"" action would be taken if the law was not followed to protect the right of customers to choose how their data is used.

HelloFresh

Food retail expert Teresa Wickham said the company's brand would be damaged as well as its bottom line

HelloFresh said its customers were ""at the centre of everything we do"" and that the company took its data protection obligations extremely seriously.

In contrast to the 14 complaints that the ICO said it received directly, HelloFresh claimed the regulator received just three.

""We have worked closely with the ICO,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We have carefully considered their feedback and have made changes to our SMS and email policy,""

A tough market

HelloFresh was founded in 2011. Members choose meals from a changing online menu and receive recipes and fresh ingredients in a box once a week ready for cooking. Subscribers are often attracted by deals with up to 60% off their first box.

The recipe box market is ""very tough"", according to food retail retail expert Teresa Wickham, with competitors including Gusto and the Mindful Chef.

""It's a highly competitive business,"" Ms Wickham said. ""Overhead costs, with labour, electricity and fuel to deliver, are high. But [profit] margins in horticulture and wholesale are quite low. It's cut-throat.""

The former supermarket director said the ICO investigation would damage HelloFresh. ""Any fine will hurt them,"" she said. ""It will affect their brand and their bottom line.""","HelloFresh fined over millions of spam texts and emailsBy Jemma Dempsey BBC NewsHelloFreshThe ICO found HelloFresh had sent millions of spam emails and texts over a seven-month periodFood delivery company HelloFresh has been fined for sending millions of spam emails and texts to customers.

Later that year the Japanese superstar opened up about suffering depression, taking extended breaks from the tour as a result, before an even longer absence as she gave birth to her daughter Shai in 2023.

Now the 26-year-old is back from maternity leave and says returning as a mother has given her a ""different mindset"".

The early signs are she remains the same talent, showing glimpses of her explosive shot-making and fleetness of foot on her return in Brisbane last week.

There is no doubt Osaka has the technical tools to go back to the very top. How quickly she can challenge for the biggest prizes again remains to be seen.

Poland's Iga Swiatek has dominated the WTA game for almost two years and a fine start to 2024 has seen the world number one extend her unbeaten run to 16 matches after helping Poland reach the United Cup final.

Sabalenka is continuing to push Swiatek. The 25-year-old Belarusian, who briefly replaced Swiatek at the top of the rankings last season, reached at least the semi-finals of all four majors in 2023 and will be confident of a strong title defence in Melbourne.

Sabalenka saw her 15-match winning streak ruthlessly ended in the Brisbane final by Kazakhstan's 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who is another serious contender.

And it will be fascinating to see how American teenage Coco Gauff, who defended her WTA title in Auckland last week, will deal with her new-found status as a Grand Slam champion after a triumphant US Open victory which illustrated her growing maturity and inner belief.","When Naomi Osaka won her fourth major title at the 2021 Australian Open, it felt like she would lead the women's game for years to come as both an athlete and an advocate.

The Emmy Awards are given for outstanding achievement in the television industry

ESPN has returned more than 30 Emmy statuettes after the award hosts uncovered a ploy in which some network employees used fake names to circumvent eligibility rules.

The network has said the ploy was ""a misguided attempt"" to recognise on-air talent that were not eligible for certain categories.

The awards won were reportedly re-engraved with the real names of the on-air personalities.

The sports network has apologised.

Details of the ploy were first uncovered in a report on Thursday by sports publication The Athletic.

The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the organisation behind the Emmys, told The Athletic that it had ""identified a number of fictitious credits submitted by ESPN to multiple Sports Emmys competitions"".

NATAS then notified ESPN's senior management of this finding, who has since apologised and reprimanded those who were responsible.

The Athletic's report centred around ESPN's ""College GameDay"" programme, which nabbed eight Emmys for Outstanding Weekly Studio Show between 2008 and 2018.

Until 2023, that category prohibited submissions from on-air talent in an effort to avoid duplicate wins for a single programme.

On-air personalities could instead submit for other categories, like Outstanding Host or Emerging On-Air Talent.

In a bid to secure awards for their on-air talent, the network reportedly circumvented eligibility rules by submitting entries with fake names credited for the programme.

The fake names were similar to those of the on-air personalities, with the same initials but slightly altered.

There is no evidence suggesting the on-air personalities were aware of the submissions or the ploy.

In a statement to the BBC, ESPN spokesperson Julie McKay said the ploy involved award submissions that may date back as far back as 1997.

""This was a misguided attempt to recognize on-air individuals who were important members of our production team, "" Ms McKay said in an email. ""Once current leadership was made aware, we apologized to [The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences] for violating guidelines.""

Ms McKay said the network has brought in outside counsel to conduct ""a full and thorough investigation."" She added those who were responsible were disciplined by ESPN.","ESPN apologises for Emmy entries won with fake namesBy Nadine Yousif BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe Emmy Awards are given for outstanding achievement in the television industryESPN has returned more than 30 Emmy statuettes after the award hosts uncovered a ploy in which some network employees used fake names to circumvent eligibility rules.

The court filings said the victims had been left ""emotionally, psychologically, and physically"" terrorised.

eBay has agreed to pay a $3m (£2.36m) fine to resolve harassment charges against bloggers critical of the company.

Executives at eBay sent live spiders and cockroaches to Ina and David Steiner, according to court papers.

The couple were targeted for producing a newsletter the employees disliked, prosecutors said.

The filings said the couple had been left ""emotionally, psychologically, and physically"" terrorised.

The US Attorney's Office in the District of Massachusetts said Jim Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, had targeted the couple for producing EcommerceBytes, a newsletter that the company's executives were unhappy with.

Baugh and six associates led a campaign to intimidate the Steiners, the court papers say.

The acts of intimidation included sending live insects, a foetal pig and a funeral wreath to the Steiners' home in Natick, Massachusetts.

Baugh and his associates also installed a GPS tracking device on the couple's car and created posts on the website Craigslist inviting sexual encounters at their home, according to the filings.

The employees in question were fired by eBay shortly after the incident.

In 2021, employee Philip Cooke was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The following year, Baugh was sentenced to nearly five years.

Baugh's lawyers said he faced pressure from former eBay CEO Devin Wenig to rein in the Steiners over their coverage of the company.

Mr Wenig, who stepped down in 2019, has not been charged in the case and denies knowledge of the harassment campaign.

Watch: Fighter jets strike targets in Yemen

Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first.

But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence.

The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"".

In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"".

Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation.

Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress.

""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.""

""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us.""

Pramila Jayapal and other progressives fumed that President Biden had bypassed Congress

Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval.

""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas.

US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval.

After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"".

But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress.

Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades.

Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action.

Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision.

""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night.

""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added.

Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed.

""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said.

Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action.

Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel.

The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life; degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim.

The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"".

The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim.

But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal.","Progressive Democrats fume over Houthi strikes as Republicans offer rare praiseBy Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue BBC News, WashingtonWatch: Fighter jets strike targets in YemenProgressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Watch: Video shows impact of snow storm in Iowa ahead of caucus

A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend.

From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state.

Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday.

It is the week's third major US storm.

Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard.

A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York.

Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021.

In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C).

The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021.

Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need.

He said another days-long blackout was unlikely.

""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat.

Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor.

To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated.

In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"".

Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan.

Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois.

Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power.

The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children.

The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states.

Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.

In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph. Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned.

""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often.""

Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas.

In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph.

However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US.

Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high.

A blizzard in Iowa is hampering campaigning for the Iowa caucuses

The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"".

Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State.

Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"".

Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country.

An artist's impression highlighting the positions of the Big Ring (in blue) and Giant Arc (shown in red) in the sky.

Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space.

It is 1.3bn light-years in diameter and appears to be roughly 15 times the size of the Moon in the night sky as seen from Earth.

Named the Big Ring by the astronomers, it is made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

They say that it is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe.

It cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power.

Such large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe.

Although stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form.

The Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play.

According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing.

""This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time,"" he said.

The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure spanning 3.3bn light-years of space.

Asked how it felt to have made the discoveries, she said: ""It's really surreal. I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can't believe that I'm talking about it, I don't believe that it's me

""Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,"" she said.

""And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important - but what exactly?""

Both the Big Ring and the Giant Arc appear relatively close together, near the constellation of Bootes the Herdsman.

Professor Don Pollacco, of the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects might be related and form an even larger structure.

""So the question is how do you make such large structures?

""It's incredibly hard to conceive of any mechanism that could produce these structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the early universe where waves of high and low density material are 'frozen' in to extragalactic medium.""

There are also similarly large structures discovered by other cosmologists - such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length, and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across.

But the biggest single entity scientists have identified is a supercluster of galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion light-years wide.

While the Big Ring appears as an almost perfect ring on the sky, analysis by Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face aligned with Earth.

""The Big Ring and the Giant Arc, both individually and together, gives us a big cosmological mystery as we work to understand the universe and its development.""

The findings have been presented at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in New Orleans.

Roberts said she's ""very forthright"" in expressing her views on film sets

Julia Roberts has said she has made the choice not to do nude scenes throughout her 35-year film career.

""You know, not criticising others' choices, but for me to not take off my clothes in a movie or be vulnerable in physical ways is a choice that I guess I make for myself,"" she said.

The actress, interviewed by Notting Hill writer and director Richard Curtis for British Vogue, also said she nearly didn't take the film's starring role.

""Honestly, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was your movie, playing a movie actress,"" she told him.

""I was so uncomfortable! I mean, we've talked about this so many times, but I almost didn't take the part because it just seemed - oh, it just seemed so awkward. I didn't even know how to play that person.""

The star was also asked if she chose roles that represented her views on feminism.

""It would be more to the point that the things I choose not to do are representative of me,"" she replied.

She added: ""But in effect, I'm choosing not to do something as opposed to choosing to do something.""

Roberts said she'd had a ""G-rated career"" - referring to the US film rating for movies suitable for a general audience.

Roberts shot to fame opposite Richard Gere in Pretty Woman

She had a body double for revealing scenes as a prostitute in 1990's Pretty Woman, and has previously spoken about asking for an explicit sex scene in 2009's Duplicity to be changed.

""It's not really what I do, so if you're going to ask me to do it, you have to expect it to be toned down. You know, as a mum of three, I feel like that,"" she was reported to have said at the time.

She also once said: ""I wouldn't do nudity in films. To act with my clothes on is a performance. To act with my clothes off is a documentary.""

'I speak plainly'

During the new Vogue interview, Curtis said there was a ""tough side"" to Roberts.

""I think I speak very plainly,"" the Oscar winner responded. ""That's kind of how I see myself. I'm very forthright.

""There are a lot of personalities in the world that don't accept that easily, and it can seem really harsh, even if I feel like I'm just being honest about something and just saying, 'This is how I see it'. I never am trying to be unkind.""

She recalled that she ""loathed"" a costume that had been chosen for her to wear in a key scene in Notting Hill, so decided to send her driver back to her flat to fetch her own clothes for her to wear instead.

""It was my own flip-flops and my cute little blue velvet skirt and a T-shirt and my cardigan.""

Roberts also said young film stars have a more ""exhausting"" and ""chaotic"" time now compared with the late 1980s and early 90s, when she made her name.

""I don't know if it's better [today], because it's not my experience, but it just seems very different,"" she said. ""And in a way, it seems so cluttered. There are so many elements to being famous now, it just seems exhausting.

""Whereas I feel like, and again this is just my perception, because I don't really know - I'm not a young person starting out in show business in the 21st Century - but it seems to me that it was: you meet people, you read for parts, you try to get jobs, you get a job, you try to do a good job, and from that job, you might meet some new people who might suggest you to some other people and then you might get another job and you might get paid a little bit more for that job, and it might be a little bit of a better job.","Julia Roberts says she has made the choice not to do nude scenesBy Ian Youngs Entertainment & arts reporterGetty ImagesRoberts said she's ""very forthright"" in expressing her views on film setsJulia Roberts has said she has made the choice not to do nude scenes throughout her 35-year film career.

By Sam Cabral BBC News

Carlos Moore Law Group

Aderrien Murry survived the shooting but suffered a collapsed lung, fractured rib and lacerated liver

Attorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi.

It follows last week's release of body camera footage from the moments before Aderrien Murry was shot in his home after calling police for help.

He suffered a collapsed lung, fractured ribs and a lacerated liver. His family is suing the city where it took place.

The officer involved has been cleared of criminal conduct and reinstated.

The flurry of new information about the May 2023 shooting in the city of Indianola follows a nearly seven-month probe by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI).

Last month, the state's attorney general said Sergeant Greg Capers will not face charges after a grand jury determined the bureau's findings showed no evidence of criminal conduct on his part.

Sergeant Capers, who was placed on unpaid administrative leave after the shooting, has since re-joined the Indianola Police Department.

But the Murry family has continued to argue the shooting was not justified, with Aderrien's mother, Nakala, pushing for footage from the incident to be publicly released.

The newly released 911 recordings raise questions about whether Mr Capers knew there was a child in the house when he and another officer responded to domestic disturbance calls placed by Ms Murry's mother, who was not there, and then by Aderrien.

A man later identified as John Nolden, the father of one of Ms Murry's other children, had shown up unexpectedly at the home in the early hours of the morning.

That led a frightened Ms Murry to give her son a cell phone and ask him to call for help, first by informing his grandmother and then by calling 911.

Last Friday, in response to Ms Murry's repeated pleas, state officials released body camera footage of the moments leading up to the shooting of Aderrien.

The video shows Mr Capers approaching the Murry home with a colleague, repeatedly banging on the front door and - with permission from the 911 dispatcher - unsuccessfully attempting to kick it open.

When Ms Murry opens the door, he is heard twice shouting: ""Let me see your hands."" Ms Murry immediately complies.

""Where's he at?"" Mr Capers then asks twice. As Ms Murry gestures inside the home with her head, he asks her to come out of the house and she steps outside.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigation

The officer is then heard repeatedly asking the intruder to come out, adding ""don't make us come in"".

He also asks if the man is armed, to which Ms Murry appears to respond that he is not.

As Mr Capers enters the empty living room, Aderrien walks into the frame with his hands over his head.

Mr Capers immediately opens fire, shoots him in the chest and then says ""Oh, my god"".

As the boy screams in pain and runs out the door yelling for his mother, the officer begins calling for an ambulance on his dispatch radio.

""What did I do?"" Aderrien is said to have asked his mother after being shot. ""I don't want to die.""

He spent four days recovering in a local hospital, during which he was placed on a ventilator and given a chest tube.

Sharing his story for the first time in May with Good Morning America (GMA), the child described feeling like he had been struck by ""a big punch to the chest"".

He also said he had previously wanted to be a police officer but changed his mind after the shooting.

In a December GMA interview, Mr Capers, who is also black, said the shooting was ""spur of the moment"" and ""definitely wasn't intentional"".

National law enforcement statistics suggest domestic disturbance calls are dangerous for US police, often leading to officer assaults and even deaths. Experts say that puts them on high alert.

Carlos Moore, an attorney representing the Murry family, said in a statement that the video footage ""allows the world to independently assess whether the actions of Greg Capers were justified"".

After the MBI declined to release copies of Aderrien's 911 call, saying that it would violate state law, Mr Moore released the tapes himself on Thursday.

The five minutes of audio detail four separate 911 calls, including the first from Aderrien's grandmother and the one placed by the boy himself.

The tapes suggest that the 911 dispatcher may not have conveyed to Mr Capers and his colleague that there was a boy inside the house and it was he who called for help.

""The audio recordings reveal that one caller advised the police that no weapons were involved, and another caller advised that there was a child in the house,"" Mr Moore said in a statement to The Enterprise-Tocsin local newspaper.

""This crucial information should have been known to the responding officers and should have informed their approach to the situation.""

The city has so far declined to comment on either the video or audio releases.

The Murry family is currently suing the city and its police force for $5m (£3.9m).

The civil rights suit calls for Mr Capers and Indianola Police Chief Ronald Sampson to be fired.

It alleges the responding officers acted with gross negligence and reckless disregard ""so outrageous that it shocks the moral and legal conscience of the community"".","Aderrien Murry: Audio and video offer clues on shooting of boy, 11, by policeBy Sam Cabral BBC NewsCarlos Moore Law GroupAderrien Murry survived the shooting but suffered a collapsed lung, fractured rib and lacerated liverAttorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi.

Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.

On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border.

At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump.

""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said.

The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines.

Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back.

Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls.

""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday.

The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with.""

The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points.

Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics; that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense.

""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project.

""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do.""

Nikki Haley made her pitch to voters in an Iowa pub on Tuesday

So what exactly is her game plan?

Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win.

They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election.

In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said.

Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state.

Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her.

Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump.

""She's not up to this,"" he said.

Ms Haley seems poised to overtake Ron DeSantis for second place

Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations.

""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina.

Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop.

Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote.

""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple.""

Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars.

In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces.

""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted.""

Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election.

""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points.""

But she has to defeat Mr Trump first.

""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant.

Getty Images

Ms Haley has cast herself as Mr Trump's main rival

At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley.

""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider.""

The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre.

She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else.

Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming.

In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"".

Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations.

Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first.""

The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa.

The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?

By Chloe Kim BBC News, New York

Watch: Rapper Jelly Roll urges Congress to take action on US fentanyl crisis

Rapper and country artist Jelly Roll, who at one time sold drugs, is now urging Congress to pass anti-fentanyl legislation that targets traffickers.

The two-time Grammy nominee, whose real name is Jason DeFord, acknowledged on Thursday the role he once played in the crisis.

But he told lawmakers he has also personally seen the devastation drugs are causing across the US.

""I've attended more funerals than I care to share with y'all,"" he said.

""I could sit here and cry for days about the caskets I've carried of people I love dearly, deeply, in my soul.""

Fentanyl is a leading killer in the US - contributing to over 100,000 deaths in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six out of 10 fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills contain a lethal dose of fentanyl, the US Drug Enforcement Administration found.

The Country Music Award winner urged legislators in the Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to pass the bill, which would enforce financial sanctions against drug traffickers to disrupt the flow of the drugs coming from Mexico and China.

DeFord said it is time to ""proactive"", not ""reactive"" towards the crisis.

Though he was lobbying for legislation put forward by Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, he said this was a bipartisan issue.

He said: ""I truly believe in my heart that this bill will stop the supply and can help stop the supply of fentanyl.""

In his testimony, DeFord said 190 people on average die a day from a fentanyl overdose.

He asked Congress: ""Could you imagine the national media attention it would get if they were reporting that a plane was crashing every single day and killing 190 people?""

""But because it's 190 drug addicts, we don't feel that way,"" DeFord said, adding that society has been known to ""bully and shame drug addicts"".

From the age of 14, DeFord ran into trouble with law, spending 10 years in and out of detention facilities for drug-related crimes.

""I believed when I sold drugs, genuinely, that selling drugs was a victimless crime,"" DeFord said.

""I brought my community down. I hurt people. I was the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about, just like these drug dealers are doing right now when they're mixing every drug on the market with fentanyl. And they're killing the people we love,"" he told senators.","Country artist Jelly Roll pushes for anti-fentanyl billBy Chloe Kim BBC News, New YorkWatch: Rapper Jelly Roll urges Congress to take action on US fentanyl crisisRapper and country artist Jelly Roll, who at one time sold drugs, is now urging Congress to pass anti-fentanyl legislation that targets traffickers.

By Jeremy Bowen BBC international editor

Watch: Fighter jets strike targets in Yemen

It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened.

Hopes for containing what is happening rest on the fact that it is still relatively low-level, compared to the worst-case scenarios of regional war.

The US and British attacks on the Houthis in Yemen are not just, as ministers in London have suggested, about the freedom of navigation and world trade.

They are directly linked to events in Gaza and represent an escalation of the crisis that is gripping the region.

The Houthis immediately vowed to respond. It is also entirely possible that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria will increase the action they are taking against the American forces in the region.

If that theatre heats up more, and US forces retaliate, it will be harder for the American diplomacy effort to avert all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political movement backed by Iran.

The Houthis are also part of the network of allies and proxies, the so-called axis of resistance, that Iran has constructed to give it forward defence against its enemies.

They are getting increasingly sophisticated weapons from Iran, but it is best to think of them as allies rather than Tehran's proxy.

I have spent quite a bit of time with the Houthis in Yemen and they are people who are highly independently minded. They will relish conflict with the Americans. They want to be part of this war. What has been happening suits both the Houthis and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Reuters

Houthi supporters demonstrate on Friday after the US and UK air strikes

Iran has beefed up their capabilities and the kind of firepower that the Houthis have at their disposal. That includes anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles they have fired at Israel as well as attack drones - the same sort that Iran supplies to Russia to use against Ukraine. They are well-armed.

It is nothing like the naval capacity that they are facing from the US, UK and other members of the coalition the Americans have assembled in the Red Sea. But the threat the Houthis pose is less about the physical damage they might cause and more about the danger to international navigation.

In December, they hijacked a ship and forced it into one of their ports. They have also fired directly at ships and caused some damage, although they have not sunk any vessels.

Commercial shipping companies who want to get their valuable cargoes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the mouth of Red Sea do not want to have hostile forces firing at them. Because of the risks, the insurance costs will rocket, and that's why so many companies are now choosing to detour along the west coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, the shortcut between Asia and Europe that routes ships down the Red Sea and through Bab al-Mandab.

The Houthis have controlled Sanaa, Yemen's capital, and big parts of the country including the Red Sea coast since 2014. In 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition, also including the United Arab Emirates, that went to war to try to overthrow them.

The Saudis said the intervention in Yemen's civil war was to re-establish the country's legitimate and internationally recognised government, which the Houthis had overthrown.

But a few days after the intervention started, I spoke to very senior Saudis who told me it was to stop Iran from operating in their back yard. Yemen has a frontier with Saudi Arabia.

The Houthis were then bombed by the Saudis from 2015 until the ceasefire came in over a year ago, so a fresh round of strikes is unlikely to intimidate them - they are used to it.

I don't think one single round of air strikes is going to do more than make them think yes, we are on the right track. They want to be seen as a fearless resistance to America and its Western allies, who also back Israel.

The Houthis have said that they are carrying out these attacks in the Red Sea because of the war in Gaza, the killing of civilians and the severe privations Israel has imposed by blocking all but a fraction of the food and relief supplies that they need to survive.

They have said that if the war in Gaza ended and if supplies were permitted to enter, then they wouldn't be threatening a major international shipping lane.

Some critics of the American and British support for Israel say that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would be a much better way to stop the Houthi attacks than bombing them. If Houthi attacks continued after a ceasefire, the argument is that air strikes against them would have increased legitimacy.

There is the possibility that this US-UK action could prolong or escalate the situation with the Houthis, rather than shutting it down. Last November, when the Houthis made their first moves in the wider Gaza war with their first attacks on merchant shipping off the Yemen coast, I spoke to Mohammed Ali Al Houthi, one of the leading members of their organisation. He was very defiant then and I am absolutely certain the Houthis will continue to be defiant now.

They will want to carry out more attacks, to show that they are defiant and unbeaten.

The US and UK attacks hit many different locations. While it is not possible to know the Houthis' precise military capacity, it seems unlikely that one round of strikes will have taken it out.

Houthi fighters pictured in Sanaa yesterday

Regular bombardment by the Saudis since 2015 did not appear to have had a significant impact on their capacity. Yemen is a mountainous country. Given their experience of being bombed it is likely they will have tried to hide things away. Iran presumably has sent advisers and trainers to Yemen to help them operate the weapons they have supplied, and they too will have thought about ways of surviving attacks.

We can gauge the way that Iran has upgraded the Houthi arsenal by looking at the kind of weapons they are firing out of Yemen. They are more sophisticated, more lethal and therefore more of a threat.

When the Houthis took over a merchant ship last month, video of their attack showed well-trained commandoes landing from a helicopter. They are more formidable than the images we often see on TV, of groups of raggedly dressed men waving Kalashnikovs.

Compared to the force the US and UK can wield there is no comparison, but that isn't the point in this kind of warfare.

If the Houthis, who have supporters across the region, are able to continue to threaten and fire on ships in some way then they will signal to their followers that they are not bowed by the West.","Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spreadBy Jeremy Bowen BBC international editorWatch: Fighter jets strike targets in YemenIt is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East.

Danielle Hinsley

Two sisters caught four care workers abusing their 89-year-old grandmother after hiding a camera in her bedroom.

Danielle Hinsley and her sister Rebecca became suspicious after Beryl Wall's behaviour changed and she began to get bruises on her face and wrists.

Like a scene from the hugely popular Netflix drama Fool Me Once, they put a photo frame with a hidden camera in her room at a care home in Wolverhampton.

Four days of footage from February 2020 was enough to convict her attackers.

It caught the workers shouting in dementia sufferer Mrs Wall's face, making fun of her, holding her legs in the air and hitting her in the face with a pillow.

Danielle Hinsley

It was these bruises on Mrs Wall's face that made her granddaughters get the hidden camera

Ame Tunkara, Morounranti Adefila, Danny Ohen and Bridget Aideyan were jailed at the end of 2023.

""Knowing they spent Christmas and new year away from their families is the best punishment,"" Danielle said.

The sisters saw their grandmother regularly so quickly spotted her decline.

""We visited nan every day as this happened before lockdown,"" Danielle said.

""Her behaviour had changed, she had bruises. So I went home and ordered a picture frame camera off Amazon and put a picture of me, my sister and my nan in it.""

Danielle Hinsley

Mrs Wall's family shared images of care home workers being abusive caught on the hidden camera

It is the same type of camera millions of viewers have seen actress Michelle Keegan use in Fool Me Once, which is currently Netflix's number one drama worldwide.

It is given to her to keep an eye on her daughter's nanny, but captures more than she is expecting.

Naked and confused

When Danielle viewed the footage several days later, she said it ""broke my heart"".

It captured the people who should have been caring for her most mocking Mrs Wall and pinching her face.

In much of the footage their grandmother was naked and confused, Danielle said.

The sisters took their evidence to the care home managers, the Care Quality Commission and West Midlands Police.

Three of the four workers were from an agency and one was a permanent member of staff.

Danielle Hinsley

Mrs Wall's behaviour changed from being happy to being distressed

Ohen was on his first shift at the home when he was caught on camera intimidating Mrs Wall and hitting her in the face with a pillow.

The family does not want to name the care home, which is under new management and whose other staff had been ""amazing"", they said, caring for Mrs Wall until she died in October last year.

""We believe nan waited for the trial to end because she took a turn quite quickly when we told her the verdict,"" Danielle said.

""She was my everything and always will be my everything.""

West Midlands Police

Ame Tunkara (left) and Bridget Aideyan were jailed for four months

In total, eight care workers were charged for abusing Mrs Wall but only four were found guilty.

Tunkara, 33, of Walsall, and Adefila, 43, of Wolverhampton, were found guilty of ill-treatment and wilful neglect and sentenced in December to four months in prison.

Ohen, 39, and Aideyan, 49, both from Wolverhampton, were also found guilty of the same offences and sentenced to six months and four months, respectively.

By Georgina Rannard Science reporter, BBC News

Stephen Rostain

Scientists found evidence of 6,000 mounds thought to be the basis for ancient homes

A huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.

The discovery changes what we know about the history of people living in the Amazon.

The houses and plazas in the Upano area in eastern Ecuador were connected by an astounding network of roads and canals.

The area lies in the shadow of a volcano that created rich local soils but also may have led to the destruction of the society.

While we knew about cities in the highlands of South America, like Machu Picchu in Peru, it was believed that people only lived nomadically or in tiny settlements in the Amazon.

""This is older than any other site we know in the Amazon. We have a Eurocentric view of civilisation, but this shows we have to change our idea about what is culture and civilisation,"" says Prof Stephen Rostain, director of investigation at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, who led the research.

""It changes the way we see Amazonian cultures. Most people picture small groups, probably naked, living in huts and clearing land - this shows ancient people lived in complicated urban societies,"" says co-author Antoine Dorison.

The city was built around 2,500 years ago, and people lived there for up to 1,000 years, according to archaeologists.

It is difficult to accurately estimate how many people lived there at any one time, but scientists say it is certainly in the 10,000s if not 100,000s.

The archaeologists combined ground excavations with a survey of a 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area using laser sensors flown on a plane that could identify remains of the city beneath the dense plants and trees.

This LiDAR technology found 6,000 rectangular platforms measuring about 20m (66 ft) by 10m (33 ft) and 2-3m high.

They were arranged in groups of three to six units around a plaza with a central platform.

The scientists believe many were homes, but some were for ceremonial purposes. One complex, at Kilamope, included a 140m (459 ft) by 40m (131 ft) platform.

They were built by cutting into hills and creating a platform of earth on top.

Stephen Rostain

Roads, paths and canals were found connecting the platforms suggesting a large area was occupied

A network of straight roads and paths connected many of the platforms, including one that extended 25km (16 miles).

Dr Dorison said these roads were the most striking part of the research.

""The road network is very sophisticated. It extends over a vast distance, everything is connected. And there are right angles, which is very impressive,"" he says, explaining that it is much harder to build a straight road than one that fits in with the landscape.

He believes some had a ""very powerful meaning"", perhaps linked to a ceremony or belief.

The scientists also identified causeways with ditches on either side which they believe were canals that helped manage the abundant water in the region.

There were signs of threats to the cities - some ditches blocked entrances to the settlements, and may be evidence of threats from nearby people.

Researchers first found evidence of a city in the 1970s, but this is the first time a comprehensive survey has been completed, after 25 years of research.

It reveals a large, complex society that appears to be even bigger than the well-known Mayan societies in Mexico and Central America.

""Imagine that you discovered another civilisation like the Maya, but with completely different architecture, land use, ceramics,"" says José Iriarte, a professor of archaeology at University of Exeter, who was not involved in this research.

Some of the findings are ""unique"" for South America, he explains, pointing to the octagonal and rectangular platforms arranged together.

The societies were clearly well-organised and interconnected, he says, highlighting the long sunken roads between settlements.

Not a huge amount is known about the people who lived there and what their societies were like.

Pits and hearths were found in the platforms, as well as jars, stones to grind plants and burnt seeds.

The Kilamope and Upano people living there probably mostly focussed on agriculture. People ate maize and sweet potato, and probably drank ""chicha"", a type of sweet beer.

Prof Rostain says he was warned against this research at the start of his career because scientists believed no ancient groups had lived in the Amazon.

""But I'm very stubborn, so I did it anyway. Now I must admit I am quite happy to have made such a big discovery,"" he says.","Huge ancient lost city found in the AmazonBy Georgina Rannard Science reporter, BBC NewsStephen RostainScientists found evidence of 6,000 mounds thought to be the basis for ancient homesA huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.

By Thomas Moynihan Features correspondent

Looking to a brighter future? (Credit: Getty Images)

Historian Thomas Moynihan explores what we can learn from the hopeful and 'flagrantly fictional' forecasts written 100 years ago, just as humanity was emerging from a global pandemic, the end of the First World War and encountering rapid technological change.

From Hunger Games to Squid Games, from Black Mirror to Blade Runner, the appetite for dystopia seems higher than ever. Perhaps this is because the cliches of the genre are seeping beyond fiction. Both Elon Musk's Neuralink and Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse seem lifted straight from cautionary tales. Meanwhile, AI poises unprecedented challenges, and human-made climate change threatens to destabilise our fragile world order.

Dystopian fiction can be vitally important. It can contain important warnings: raising alarms on social issues through extrapolating troubling trajectories. But in relentlessly imagining the future as already lost to dystopia in our fiction, it's possible we risk giving up on it in reality too.

As we now look ahead across 2024 – and the years, decades and centuries that follow – could there be other ways of thinking about the future?

The obvious response is a utopian lens, but this also has its flaws. Although utopias can expand minds, they also can tempt those too bewitched by them to act rashly or harmfully, by forcing their hopes upon the present.

As a historian who studies how worldviews transform and priorities alter as we learn more about ourselves and our place in the Universe, I'm interested in how people's perceptions of the future have changed over time. If we look back 100 years, how was tomorrow imagined back then? A century ago, there were dystopias and utopias, but many writers and thinkers also approached the future in other ways: with an open, nuanced and often playful perspective. And they did so despite the grave challenges they faced in their societies. What might we learn from these visions?

Picture a world where horrifying war rages in Europe and the Middle East; where a pandemic has gripped the globe; where the masses suffer a deteriorating climate, while sweeping inequality jars against unprecedented wealth. A world where protest flares in the name of social justice, revolting against oppressive pasts and corrupt monopolies. A world where emerging technologies seem set to disrupt society's foundations, whether by automating away swathes of labour or, worse, precipitating universal catastrophe.

This doesn't just describe how some people view our present. It paints a picture, too, of affairs a century ago, as the 1910s shaded into the 1920s. Witness to World War One’s mechanised massacre, alongside a deadly pandemic, the period saw rapid developments in science, promising the unloosing of powers that were arguably even more disturbing.

Where we have climate change, they had smog and slums. Where our phones and feeds make us point-blank witnesses to the world's tragedies, they were, thanks to a newly coalesced global news network, the first generation to experience disasters as mass-media spectacles, like the sinking of HMS Titanic. Where they saw growing numbers of multimillionaires (one of which perished in the aforementioned shipwreck), we anticipate the first trillionaire. Where, today, geopolitical stabilities seem to be unravelling, they witnessed the spread of new authoritarian regimes.

You may also like:

Understandably, back then, there was similarly a burst of dystopian fiction. There were chilling visions of tech-fuelled totalitarianism, where Earth's oceans are filled in and its mountains levelled, whilst humans become drones serving like neurons powering one centralised, mechanised mega-brain. There were even prescient visions of climate disaster. Take, for example, Alfred Döblin's 1924 Mountains, Oceans, Giants: it depicts a high-tech future suffering overpopulation, where a plan is formulated to melt Greenland's icecap to create more living space. A mysterious, newly discovered form of energy is wielded to accomplish this, with disastrous results, as it unleashes all-consuming environmental cataclysm, rippling across the Northern hemisphere.

Nonetheless, there was resonant hope, too. Hope that the juggernaut of civilisation could be steered: that its technological forces — unloosed by the genie of science — could be collectively and equitably harnessed for the betterment of the world. Theirs was a generation whose future seemed torn between hope and dystopia, between renovation and final calamity.

Comment & Analysis Thomas Moynihan is a historian and author. Currently, he is a Visting Researcher at Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.

Amid the dystopias, there remained widespread conviction that technology could be harnessed, in harmony with the natural world, to emancipate, rather than to suppress, humanity. Speaking to a crowded hall in Yorkshire in 1923, Keir Hardie — who founded the UK's left-leaning Labour Party in 1900 — directly compared science's empowerments to those of his movement. He noted how physicists had recently discovered entirely new forms of energy, from X-rays to radioactivity.

Harnessed properly, Hardie suggested, these powers promised everything from medical miracles to unshackling abundances of unpolluting energy. Directly comparing such scientific revelations to Labour's struggle for worker's rights and protections, he declared that the formation of Britain's nascent welfare state may similarly set free hitherto ""undreamed-of powers and forces in human nature"".

Such statements might chime discordantly now ""technology"" often appears indistinct from ""big tech"", and more a totem for growing inequality than egalitarianism. However, back then, the wedding of technological innovation to private interests and profiteering was weaker, and therefore less ingrained in public consciousnesses. It reminds us that such expropriation, perhaps, wasn't historically inevitable and, therefore, doesn't necessarily need to forever continue.

By World War One's end, it was no longer questionable that science was poised to change everything, from work to warfare. Technology promised more of the same: colossal change. But it seemed, more than before, this could go in multiple directions, no longer bound to one bright destiny or dark fate. Recent shocks acted like a prism, splitting the path into tomorrow from one track into many, each leading towards dramatically different destinations, all now seemingly plausible from the present's vantage. Stranger and more multifarious prospects than those considered merely a generation before now couldn't be ignored.

One 1929 entry, by the pacificist Vera Brittain, captures the series' virtuosic tone. After decades of coordinated protest and painful struggle, women had only the previous year been universally given the vote in UK. Brittain took the opportunity to project this forward: forecasting the future of gender relations.

Titled Halcyon, or, the Future of Monogamy, it begins with Brittain drifting to sleep, and dreaming she is reading a ""moral history destined to be published in the far-distant future"". It's by ""Minerva Huxterwin"", the ""Chair of Moral History at Oxford"" (a position which didn't, and still doesn't, exist). Apparently living and writing many centuries hence, Huxterwin's specialism is chronicling the 20th Century's moral revolutions.

The rest of Brittain's book is her transcription, upon awaking, of what she dreamt reading. Of course, it's all a ploy; Huxterwin is made-up. But it's ingenious, allowing Brittain to proffer her preferred vision of what could be, using a dreamt-up historian from centuries hence as her mouthpiece.

Her hopeful vision partially panned out. Narrating Brittain's future, from her further future, Huxterwin chronicles how household technologies, introduced from the 1930s onwards, renovate gender relations throughout the 20th Century. And no longer oppressive, now mutually enjoyable, Huxterwin records marriage surviving well into the future, albeit only through being continually transformed.

Brittain's wasn't the only ""future history"" of the time. Many bold prophecies would, back then, often be winkingly presented as the reflections of commenters from centuries hence. Perhaps the most celebrated example was Edward Bellamy's bestselling Looking Backward, which, though first published in 1887, experienced a resurgence in popularity through the 1930s. It relayed reflections transmitted from the socialist idyll Bellamy boldly imagined America would become by AD 2000.

This generation wasn’t the first to use the device of the future historian. During the height of their empire, Victorians liked to spook themselves envisioning how, in some misty future, travelling archaeologists, from distant lands, may decipher London's decayed ruins. Often these visitors were envisioned as indigenous peoples from other continents – now imagined in the position of imperial ascendency – in a move designed to scandalise the racist sensibilities of Victorian England.

The Victorians’ use of future history, however, constricts imaginations more than expands them. It frames the future as set, with time on one track, composed, in this instance, of rising and falling of empires and ascendancies. The tempo might have varied, but not the tune. Skipping ahead this way allowed writers to claim things could not have gone any other way. Tidily pruning paths untrodden, insinuating they were never live options anyway, this makes time’s course seem sealed from what’s unforeseen or unforeseeable.

When Brittain and others imagined future historians, they were actually drawing from a tradition practised by earlier writers like Joseph Addison, which opened rather the closed minds. In 1711, Addison pondered what ""impartial"" assessment a future historian might make of the controversial politics of his time. His prediction is knowingly derailed, though, as Addison interrupts himself, segueing into glaring partiality: his future historian ends up writing about posterity's esteem for Addison himself.

It's a self-aware joke. But it's doing more than highlighting how prediction is coloured by the person making it. In so flagrantly flunking impartiality, Addison is not just staging the ironic failure of his own prevision: he's also foregrounding the fallibility of all such attempts to capture the future. After all, tomorrow's attitudes will always differ from our forecasts.

The future histories of the 1920s inherited far more from Addison’s whimsy than Victorian angst. Previsions like Brittain’s were presented as blatantly made-up. Flagrantly fictional, they flaunt their pretence with a wink. As well as allowing these authors to criticise their present's limitations, inequalities and bigotries with more freedom, it also opened a space for multiple possibilities to coexist. Claiming to assume the role of future historian is patently absurd, an impossible feat. But because we all know this — audience and author alike — we understand we have strayed from the business of making serious claims about what will happen, and drifted into the wider, looser terrain of what could. Our focus has dilated, expanding from what's most probable to what's merely possible. To predict is, often, to prescribe; to propose, however, is to enter dialogue and play.

Previsions like Brittain’s were presented as blatantly made-up. Flagrantly fictional, they flaunt their pretence with a wink

To be clear, the future-gazers of 100 years ago often got things gravely wrong. But even here, we can gain insight. Living in the 2020s, we find ourselves living in the ""tomorrow"" many prophets from a century ago attempted to anticipate. We now can, like the chroniclers they imagined, look backward and assess. This reveals plenty of optimistic predictions for, say, technologies that never emerged – but also anticipations of avenues that we should be thankful history didn't take.

Take, for example, 1911's Moving the Mountain: a feminist utopia envisioned by the prominent suffragist Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Through a contrivance involving amnesia, our narrator finds himself awoken and thrown into the America of decades hence. It is unrecognisable; there are two-hour workdays; women are entirely emancipated; civilisation now powers itself via ""solar engines"". There, also, is no crime or poverty. But this is because, in Gilman's chilling words, ""degenerates"" have been sterilised and ""removed"".

The future imagined by Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined equality – but with dark consequences (Credit: Getty Images)

In Gilman's future, ""equality"" has been reached. But it has been reached not through emancipating, but rather by brutally eliminating, the downtrodden and those she deemed unfit. Gilman, like many others in the 1920s, was falsely convinced by the ideas of eugenics, and that ""moral character"" is strictly inherited rather than being shaped by one's environments or upbringing.

A few, like Brittain, saw past this. Her future historian chronicles a world wherein eugenics is never entertained, because society recognises that youngsters' destinies are dictated not by their genes but are shaped, overwhelmingly, by equal opportunity and parental affection.

Prediction isn't divorced from power and, invariably, is jaundiced by prejudice

Nonetheless, eugenic views remained widely acceptable in this period, eventually coming to influence policy globally, from the United States to Japan. Classist and racist paranoias, about ""bad stock"" outbreeding ""superior"" classes, slither through forecasts from the era. So too do prescriptions we now know to be heinous. These went on to harm innumerable real people. Had they been implemented more fully, many of us wouldn't be here today.

There's a resounding lesson here. Only a few generations ago, influential people, who were convinced they were benevolently acting in the name of future generations, were led to disastrously evil conclusions, because of misguided beliefs and unrelinquished bigotries in their present. This should give us pause when anyone speaks for the future today.

Prediction is a vexed game. So is prescribing which future is best; not just for people like yourself, but for everyone. That's why we ought to be suspicious of all visions. Indeed, prediction isn't divorced from power and, invariably, is jaundiced by prejudice. The utopias of the past often horrify us today. This insight is essential as we ourselves look forward.

Positive visions - even utopias - risk inspiring unethical acts (Credit: Getty Images)

Through remaining always vigilant of this, however, we can foster openness and multiplicity. Indeed, expectations and designs on the future wouldn't become more reliable and inclusive, over time, if no one strove to be alert to their errors and exceptions in the here and now.

The tomorrows of 100 years ago prove all this, not just in their gregarious multiplicity, but also in the biases they preserve for us to learn from today. Taken together, the lesson perhaps is this: none of today's own tomorrows will truly stand time's test, but this is no bad thing. After all, if our present also remains corrupt – in ways both visible and currently invisible – it's perhaps not so terrible if tomorrow remains beyond our reach. What we aspire to be, but are ultimately not, should comfort us, for it means there's room for improvement beyond what we can currently muster.

Here lies the power of writing future histories like Brittain's, approached with playful irreverence to one's present. It coaxes us to dislodge the blinkers of the now, even if only performatively so: to goad ourselves, from the feigned perspective of centuries hence, for being the hostages to the status quo we no doubt will be revealed to have been. Perhaps, this way, we can reach for futures not only imagined today, but also those lying just beyond the borderlands of what's currently imaginable.

This is how prophesy – done right – can do more than reflect our own prejudices and preferences back to us. It can help reengineer them anew, provoking us to fumble for what might've been overlooked, pushing us in new and challenging directions, by forcing us to glimpse ourselves as the hidebound ancestors of tomorrow's alien world. It pays to remind ourselves that, just as with generations past, we are probably also prisoners to our parochial beliefs about what's most inevitable or inescapable about our present paradigm: beliefs which, in the fullness of time, are often proven mistaken.

By clutching to the mere conviction that things can get better, hope acts as a lodestar - always shepherding but perpetually beyond reach

Today, we excel in ill-fated dystopian visions, but in the past 100 years, have we lost some of the hopefulness of yesterday's tomorrows?

A century ago, hope remained prevalent. Perhaps after the traumas of the trenches, people couldn't help but imagine better tomorrows, to make recovery worthwhile. Today something similar applies again. Climate collapse very well could wreck Earth's future; but, because of this, we must hope for better worlds tomorrow.

Such hope is distinct from the techno-optimism that naively holds that, with enough unbridled innovation, ""progress"" becomes unstoppable and everything will inevitably go well. Instead, by clutching to the mere conviction that things can get better, hope acts as a lodestar – always shepherding but perpetually beyond reach. It steers all present attempts to move beyond our troubled present, fomenting every effort to fix what is wrong with the world right here and now, without demanding some impossible utopian perfection be imminently made manifest.

There are grave threats in our collective future, but let's not forget that approaching it with buoyant openness, as much as sombre gravity, can shift things towards what's better. After all, as Brittain's case illustrates, sometimes the truly tectonic social reforms are uttered first as semi-serious daydreams of ""could"" before they can become palpable matters of ""must"".

Many people abstain from drinking to kick off the year. Non-alcoholic cocktails are a growing option – yet they're more than just a substitute for the temporarily sober.

For Chicago comedian Kristi Durkin, 1 January ushered in a wave of new year's excitement – and a 31-day alcohol-free challenge. ""Everyone on the internet is going sober,"" jokes Durkin. ""Everyone is drinking, like, tart cherry juice, and I'm really susceptible to internet trends.""

Durkin, 26, has latched onto Dry January, an annual challenge popularised by advocacy group Alcohol Change UK. Each January, participants commit to a month without alcohol, ostensibly to ""dry out"" after the holidays, and explore the merits of a sober lifestyle

In contrast with past years, Dry January doesn't necessarily mean fully ditching swanky mixed drinks. There are many non-alcoholic options on the market, particularly in cans, as the ""mocktail"" market surges.

US demand for non-alcoholic canned cocktails grew by 4% year over year, according to a study from Amsterdam-based behavioural research company Veylinx, seen by the BBC. Even big brands want in on the boom; last year, US beverage company Molson-Coors launched its first non-alcoholic cocktail, a canned concoction called Roxie. Meanwhile, a swath of emerging companies are offering upscale botanical spirits without alcohol.

Some emphasise flavour, like California-based Ghia. Launched in 2020, the company serves up an artfully designed, booze-free apéritif with a ""vibrant, fresh and satisfyingly bitter"" taste meant to appeal to people who want a complex alternative to a cocktail – something more sophisticated than, say, a diet cola.

Other brands look to substitute alcohol for purported benefits, promising nutritional or mood-boosting enhancements. This is the slant of Kin Euphorics, a brand co-founded by American supermodel Bella Hadid, which touts ""natural ingredients that nourish the mind and body"".

Yet for all the options, Dry January participants may not be making a one-for-one swap from cocktails to mocktails, says Michael Bevan, head of marketing for Veylinx. The imbibers going sober for a month may be less interested in shifting to alternatives, and more interested in muscling through a month without alcohol.

""I don't need something that tastes like alcohol to trick myself,"" says Durkin. She says she'd rather save money and drink a fizzy non-alcoholic seltzer like Topo Chico in place of alcohol. ""It's more about putting something in my hand to sip.""

Along with consumer tastes during a month of abstention, one barrier to mocktail adoption may be the cost. For those who see Dry January as a way to save money, they may not be the best option.

Ghia's Apéritif Duo, which includes two 500ml bottles, retails online for $75 (£59); in contrast, a 750ml bottle of Aperol, an alcoholic apéritif, runs about $30 (£24). Beyond canned cocktails, another emerging category in non-alcoholic alternatives is spirits. California-based Monday, which makes zero-alcohol whiskey, mezcal, gin and rum, offers a Dry January pack of four bottles for $172 (£135), discounted to $130 (£102) as of this writing. (These high prices are not always the case – non-alcoholic beer from multinational beverage company The Athletic is priced comparably to other craft brews.)

Some industry experts, however, say the point of high-end mocktails isn't to offer a direct swap for alcoholic cocktails, or to be a budget option – whether during Dry January or in general.

Hector Diaz, the co-founder of In Good Spirits, a non-alcoholic bar and bottle shop in Chicago, suggests that these drinks are more about inclusivity. ""It's less about replacing [alcohol] entirely and more about filling a need,"" says Diaz. ""A lot of consumers that don't drink in general have lacked options in the past, and for them to have them now is really great.""

Come February, Dry January practitioners may head back to alcohol, whether they're spending on canned cocktails, spirits or other beers, but Diaz is happy if the experiment teaches them something about their habits and attitudes around drinking.

""A lot of folks [visiting our store] aren't necessarily going to stop drinking alcohol, but they want to be more intentional about their choices – even if that means they're taking a quick break from alcohol during a night of drinking,"" says Diaz. ""It's all about balancing themselves out.""","Do mocktails scratch the Dry January itch?

By Tim Bird Features correspondent

As the sun falls over a vast marshland, more than a million starlings undulate in mesmerising murmurations. But how, exactly, they do it remains mysterious.

When viewed individually, the humble starling, dressed in its dappled, green-sheen plumage, is handsome enough. But when the gregarious birds coalesce together in a vast, synchronised aerial dance, these small creatures create a spectacular – if somewhat mysterious – natural wonder: a murmuration.

Each spring and autumn, as the sun sets over the extensive wetlands in and around south-western Denmark's Wadden Sea National Park, as many as 1.5 million migrating starlings swoop and soar together in a seemingly spontaneous wave-like dance. As the birds swell together, the collective stir of their wings resembles the sound of a rushing waterfall, and they form cloud-like shapes so dark and dense that they've earned their own local description: Sort Sol, or ""Black Sun"".

Starlings have fascinated humans for as long as anyone can remember. The Ancient Romans believed their undulating patterns indicated the shifting moods of the gods. In Celtic mythology, starlings were associated with Brigid, the goddess of healing and fertility. After transfixing us with their shape-shifting abilities for thousands of years, the reasons why starlings dip, rise and swirl in unison is now generally known, but there is still no definitive explanation for how they manage to achieve these seemingly choreographed patterns.

At dusk, on an overcast and chilly day in late October, I followed Jesper Danneborg Voss, a jovial local nature guide from Sort Safari, to a dyke in the Tøndermarsken marsh near the German border. Voss could hardly contain himself as he crouched next to the dyke and waited patiently for the spectacle to start. When the fading sun slipped behind the clouds, an enormous flock of starlings, some 600,000 strong, appeared from all directions into the lakeside reeds. The birds descended and came within 20m from where we are sitting, the cacophony of their chirping and flapping wings creating a deafening sound. They then swooped up, before descending again.

As Voss and I watched the birds descending to roost, he explained what leads the starlings to congregate twice a year. ""The birds [spend] the summer up in Finland, Sweden or Siberia, and when it gets cold up there and the ground starts to freeze, they start to migrate south, stopping here because the conditions are fantastic. They stay here one or two months before heading south to Belgium and England, then they fly north again in spring, congregating here again.""

According to Voss, this corner of south-western Denmark has an abundance of snails, larvae and fallen fruit, which makes it an ideal temporary home for the starlings. The marshland's tall reeds also provide a perfect night-time shelter to protect the birds from predators, which include hawks, kites and foxes. ""The birds sleep in a vertical position, clutching the reed stems, with up to five birds per stem,"" Danneborg Voss said. ""Their heart rhythm goes down and they relax. They move closer together, cosy and warm, 2m above the water. Thermal imaging has shown that the starlings' body heat at night is 31C, even if the outside temperature is a lot less.""

As the sun begins to rise, the starlings depart from their chosen resting place in a sudden, massive and noisy commotion, dispersing across the marshland to feed in small groups, often surveying their options from barn rooftops. In the evening, the birds begin to assemble again, appearing like small plumes of smoke on the horizon, before joining forces and descending in larger masses. Some of the first arrivals scout out the best roosting spots for the coming night. If predators are detected, the birds will arise again in beautiful, spontaneous formations: that's when the murmurations happen.

Scientists have recently started to study the secrets behind these formations in detail. While the exact ways in which starlings coordinate their murmurations and communicate to one another within them remains something of a mystery, many experts think that the reason they move as a single, unified organism has to do with safety in numbers. As Voss explained, predators get confused by their shifting shapes, the density of which makes it harder for a hawk, kite or eagle to pick out individual victims. Some zoologists also believe that starlings' aerial ballets help them stay warm at night by signalling to the flock to come together and roost ahead of a cold night.

In addition to their eye-catching murmurations, starlings have an uncanny ability to imitate sounds. It issaid that the Roman emperor Nero kept a starling that was able to speak both Greek and Latin. The composer Mozart, perhaps inspired by the starling's choral talents, had one in a cage next to his piano.

As with any natural spectacle, such as seeing the Northern Lights, witnessing a volcanic eruption or spotting a rare animal, experiencing a murmuration isn't always a given. The marshes and dykes around the Tøndermarsken wetlands – and even the area just across the German border – are popular starling roosting zones and therefore good murmuration-spotting spots. September and October are the best viewing times, and the towns of Højer and Tønder, which have a range of good restaurants and accommodation, make great bases to explore the Wadden Sea National Park. The chateau-style Hotel Schackenborg, some 3km west of Tønder, is an especially elegant option. But to increase your odds of seeing the formations, it helps to hire an expert guide like Voss who keep a close eye on the behaviour of the birds.

While visitors come here from across Denmark, Germany, France and the Netherlands to witness South Jutland's dramatic bi-annual bird show, not everyone adores the starlings' mass migration. The birds regularly wander into local cow sheds, sometimes by the hundreds or thousands, to feast on cattle feed left by farmers. In in Rome, where as many as four million starlings gather each winter as they migrate south to Africa, the birds excrete so many droppings that they create a safety hazard – leading one man to try to herd millions of them with lasers.

The Wadden Sea National Park is a Unesco World Heritage site that's home to a rich variety of birdlife – and not just starlings. Enormous flocks of barnacle and grey geese gather here in the winter months, while falcons, herons, swans and lapwings are also common sights. The Wadden Sea Centre, located near the town of Ribe, houses excellent introductions to the region's varied wildlife. They include good presentations and exhibits about the murmuration and every aspect of the starlings' extraordinary behaviour, placing it in the broader context of the region's unique environment. The museum is also a good place to get information on local guides and tips about the best viewing locations.

There is a majestic drama to the wide, flat landscapes in this part of Denmark. It lends itself perfectly to bicycle explorations between picturesque towns such as Højer and Tønder. ""This part of Denmark is very inspiring,"" said artist and weaver Hanne Sönnichsen. As we sat near the loom at her showroom and studio in Højer, she showed me a scarf she had designed that was inspired by the ""Black Sun"". ""It reminds me of the enormity of nature. The dance of the starlings is inspiring visually, but the incredible sound of the birds is also inspiring, [as is] the sudden silence that follows when they settle to roost. There are so many other birds, too. On my morning walks, I can hear the geese, swans and then sometimes another sound, something new. I find it easy to breathe. You can stretch your eyes here, we say.""

By Miriam Balanescu Features correspondent

StudioCanal

As a trailer is released for Back to Black, which stars Marisa Abela as Amy Winehouse, what do we know about the film so far and why are some upset by it?

Just over a decade since the death of acclaimed singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, a biopic promising to chart her ""intense journey to fame"" is already due for release. A new trailer for Back to Black released by StudioCanal and Monumental Pictures yesterday showed Industry breakout star Marisa Abela donning the singer's instantly recognisable 1960s-inspired beehive hairdo, heavy, winged eyeliner and swirling shoulder tattoos. But the reactions from Winehouse fans were far from positive: critics were quick to decry Winehouse's lack of autonomy over her representation in the film, accuse the film's producers of turning a profit from the singer's turbulent later years, and claim that the biopic comes too soon.

There were already grumbles of discontent when images of Abela on set in London emerged last year, apparently in character as Winehouse in distress – beehive dishevelled and makeup smudged. A wave of backlash swiftly followed, with one social media user describing the images as ""revolting"". Before even a clip of Back to Black had been made public, Winehouse's followers were already on high alert to the prospect that a film about her life could sensationalise its more tragic elements and exploit her story.

It's understandable that fans want to protect the singer and her legacy. During her life, Winehouse's image, drug and alcohol consumption and relationships were routinely pilloried by the press – despite her many accolades as an artist. In 2009, Winehouse gained an injunction against the paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. She was also the first woman to win five Grammy Awards, and continues to be a hugely influential artist, inspiring the likes of pop megastars Adele, Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish. A mere 13 years after her death, the possibility of seeing some of Winehouse's more tragic moments dredged up again onscreen – including performances where she was intoxicated or booed offstage – is a distasteful prospect to some.

Representations of real lives can tread a fine line between authenticity and crass parody, the final season of The Crown being a prime example. The show was criticised for ""[giving] viewers just what no one needed: more of Diana and Dodi, Charles and Camilla, Will and Kate; all of the tabloids' greatest hits.""

The concern is that Back to Black will continue to reinforce this cycle of abuse and exploitation set in motion by the media. As Roisin O'Connor writes in The Independent, ""Given the vulture-like efficiency with which her life was picked over, it's near-impossible to think of a sincere reason to make a movie about Winehouse – at least not one that isn't motivated by greed.""

Authentic or exploitative?

There is also the question of whether a biopic celebrating Winehouse's legacy is really needed when she died so young. Critics have pointed out that there are already existing films honouring Winehouse's life and career, most notably Asif Kapadia's 2015 documentary Amy. The film snapped up numerous awards, including an Oscar, a Bafta and the MTV Movie Award for best documentary. The critically acclaimed BBC documentary Reclaiming Amy followed in 2021. Is another Winehouse film justified, then?

Given that Sam Taylor-Johnson will be taking the helm as director, there is hope that Back to Black may stand up as an authentic portrait

Then there's the issue of embodying of Winehouse's iconic presence and character onscreen – surely a near impossible feat. Abela's resemblance to Winehouse has been called into question, with Winehouse's father Mitch feeling the need to defend the casting decision: ""Marisa's a great choice for the role, even if she doesn't look exactly like Amy."" Further, the decision to cast a ""newcomer"" in such a major role seems puzzling.

Given that Sam Taylor-Johnson will be taking the helm as director however, there is hope that Back to Black may stand up as an authentic portrait. The filmmaker proved her biopic credentials with Nowhere Boy, about John Lennon, which gained generally warm reviews and four Bafta nominations. According to a report in Rolling Stone, Taylor-Johnson was also reportedly friends with Winehouse. ""My connection to Amy began when I left college and was hanging out in the creatively diverse London borough of Camden,"" Taylor-Johnson said in a statement last year. ""I first saw her perform at a talent show at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, and it was immediately obvious she wasn't just 'talent'… she was genius.""

Winehouse's father, Mitch, is also involved in the film, which has raised concerns that he may in some way attempt to rewrite his daughter's story. The Amy Winehouse Foundation founder was a vocal opponent of Kapadia's documentary for its less-than-flattering portrayal. He has also been criticised for his involvement in an Amy Winehouse hologram tour – now quashed after ""unique challenges and sensitivities"" – and a Winehouse Broadway musical which is currently in the works.

With Sofia Coppola's biopic of Priscilla Presley in cinemas now, and the lives of popstars like Britney Spears being re-examined, it is clear that stories about female celebrities who experience abuse or hardship are popular – but what does that mean for Amy Winehouse? ""More recently, it had begun to feel as if [Winehouse] was finally being remembered not as a purely tragic figure but as a generational talent who released two cherished records – and someone who wasn't purely self-destructive, but a victim of systematic abuse and mental illness,"" writes Shaad D'Souza in The Guardian. ""Back to Black threatens not to honour that legacy, but to revive all the demeaning noise that obscured it in the first place.""

Back to Black is released on 12 April in the UK and on 10 May in the US.","Back to Black: Why the controversial Amy Winehouse biopic is angering fansBy Miriam Balanescu Features correspondentStudioCanalAs a trailer is released for Back to Black, which stars Marisa Abela as Amy Winehouse, what do we know about the film so far and why are some upset by it?
Just over a decade since the death of acclaimed singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, a biopic promising to chart her ""intense journey to fame"" is already due for release.
Critics have pointed out that there are already existing films honouring Winehouse's life and career, most notably Asif Kapadia's 2015 documentary Amy.
The Amy Winehouse Foundation founder was a vocal opponent of Kapadia's documentary for its less-than-flattering portrayal.
He has also been criticised for his involvement in an Amy Winehouse hologram tour – now quashed after ""unique challenges and sensitivities"" – and a Winehouse Broadway musical which is currently in the works."

With a new variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus causing a spike in cases, it is demonstrating just how much the disease has changed since the pandemic began – and what happened to ""Covid toe"".

""For almost four years, I've managed to dodge Covid-19,"" TV broadcaster Mehdi Hasan tweeted a fortnight ago. ""But it finally got me. At the end of 2023.""

Hasan added that his symptoms were thankfully mild, but he is just one of many people reporting their first ever positive test for the virus responsible for the pandemic, Sars-CoV-2, four years on from when it first began spreading around the world.

What are the symptoms of JN.1 The version of the Covid-19 virus behind the latest spike in infections shares many of the same symptoms as earlier variants of Sars-CoV-2 : a sore throat, fatigue, headache and a cough. Differences in the symptoms often depend on a person's underlying health and their immune system. But some clinicians are reporting some of the most common first signs of an infection by JN.1 are diarrhoea or a headache. Fewer patients are losing their sense of smell with variants closely-related to Omicron, of which JN.1 is a subvariant.

Covid-19 cases are starting to rise again as a result of the JN.1 Covid variant, which appeared last September in France. The variant accounts for around 60% of new infections in early January, according to a data tracker from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

At the same time, data from both the CDC and the UK Health Security Agency shows that hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 are markedly lower compared to January 2023. Primary care physicians say they are finding it virtually impossible to distinguish Covid-19 symptoms from influenza without the help of a PCR test.

""When Covid first came, it was characterised by these very odd, vague symptoms – from brain fog, feeling exhausted, and losing taste and smell,"" says Ziad Tukmachi, a GP at Chartfield Surgery in south-west London, UK. ""Now I feel it's mutated to more similar symptoms to the flu, where it's very difficult clinically to distinguish between the two.""

While this might all suggest that the virus is evolving to become progressively less pathogenic, epidemiologists believe that the reality of the situation is more nuanced.

""The virus isn't necessarily less pathogenic,"" says Greg Towers, professor of molecular virology at University College London, UK. ""Rather, it's infecting a population that are less inclined to become sick, because they've seen Sars-CoV-2 before, and they're better at regulating [their] immune response against it.""

Towers says the major lesson over the course of the pandemic is that the symptoms which appear in patients are highly dependent on prior immune status. In the first two years of Covid-19, the responses of an individual patient to the virus were primarily dictated by their state of immune health, along with prior exposure to other coronaviruses.

Now, in 2024, this is determined by a much more complex cocktail of factors, including how many times that person has already been infected by the virus, their vaccination status, and whether their vaccination-induced immunity might be on the wane.

As a result, Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the City University of New York, US, says that people now experiencing Covid-19 for the very first time are at greater risk, especially if it has been a while since their last booster vaccine.

""There are still people who have somehow managed to remain completely Covid-näive,"" says Nash. ""If they are unvaccinated or under vaccinated, they stand to have the highest risk of severe and protracted symptoms.""

Still, Sars-CoV-2 is also constantly mutating, something which is also subtly shifting how it attempts to invade the human body. The JN.1 variant has an elevated ability to evade the immune system, for example, compared to other Omicron sub-variants. But this is also altering the way it affects the human body.

One of the ongoing concerns remains the virus' ability to cause damage to blood vessels and internal organs through the creation of micro clots

In 2023, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Medicine reported that people now being infected with Omicron-related subvariants are just 6-7% as likely to lose their sense of smell or taste, compared to infections by the virus in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Instead, some clinicians such as David Strain, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter, UK, told the BBC that his patients are more likely to present either with diarrhoea or a headache having been infected with JN.1 or the EG.5 variants.

""There has been a huge shift in viral tropism, meaning which cells get infected,"" says Towers. ""And that's governed by the sequence of the spike protein. Almost everybody in the world has been infected or vaccinated, so the virus is under huge pressure to escape those immune responses to continue to transmit, so the spike protein has evolved a lot. This leads to it infecting different cells to gain entry, which is why people aren't losing their smell or taste anymore.""

Researchers are still trying to figure out whether some more subtle, internal consequences of Sars-CoV-2 infection varies between variants of the virus or whether any differences are more driven by the waning of previous vaccine-induced protection. One of the ongoing concerns remains the virus' ability to cause damage to blood vessels and internal organs through the creation of micro clots, with the kidney – an organ which is constructed of approximately one million tiny blood vessels called capillaries – seemingly particularly vulnerable based on the patients Strain has seen.

""These are just observations but we're seeing more microvascular complications and a step change in the kidney function with the new JN.1 variant that does appear to be worse than the past couple of variants,"" says Strain. ""But it's difficult to say whether it's the variant, or the fact it's 18 months to two years now since a lot of people last received a vaccine.""

With some emerging evidence hinting that micro clots might be a cause of Long Covid – a study in August 2023 even suggested that they could contribute to the cognitive problems experienced by many Long Covid patients – researchers are now concerned that we might go on to see a further spike in chronic cases. However, it would be hard to distinguish whether this is a consequence of the new variant or declining population immunity.

""Studies from the March-summer 2020 period show that the risk of Long Covid from any case, was about 10%,"" says Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. ""Now we have far more infections, and the risk of Long Covid looks to have fallen, not because of a milder variant but because of a degree of protection from vaccine doses. A paper in the BMJ on a national cohort in Sweden shows protection goes up with each additional dose.""

This all indicates the ongoing importance for all age groups of remaining up to date with vaccine boosters, but while politicians have long been keen to move on from Covid, Strain says it is vital to keep monitoring how different variants continue to infect us.

""Symptoms do seem to change from one variant to another,"" he says. ""We've had periods where the earliest symptom is headache, and others where it's more gastrointestinal. We all to go back to life as normal, but the reality is, Covid isn't going anywhere.""

Whatever happened to ""Covid toe""?

In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, reports of an unusual and baffling symptom of the disease began to emerge – patients were developing painful or intolerably itchy lesions on their feet and hands. These chilblain-like swelling and reddening of the skin became commonly known as ""Covid toe"".

Doctors and scientists were puzzled – how did a respiratory virus cause such a strange symptom in the body's extremities?

Tests on samples taken from people with Covid toe have failed to find the presence of the virus responsible for Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, in the chilblains, suggesting the virus itself is not directly responsible. Instead, a number of hypotheses have been put forward, including that it could be the result of an excessive response by part of the immune system that produces a protein called interferon IFN-1, which helps the immune system target cells infected by viruses.

Others have suggested that it may not be something specific to Covid-19 at all, and rather just a response that occurs in people who are prone to chilblains anyway.

Another theory was that lockdown rules meant more people were just not wearing adequate footwear around their homes and too much time sitting still.

Curiously, as the virus has evolved and lockdowns have lifted, so too has the apparent occurrence of these cutaneous problems. Research by scientists at King College London, UK, who studied the reported symptoms of more than 348,000 people who logged their Covid symptoms via a mobile app, has revealed that Covid toe and related skin complaints have decreased in more recent waves of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.

They were reported by 11% of people during the wave caused by the Omicron variant, compared to 17% in the Delta variant wave, where symptoms also tended to last longer.

Michael Lewis joins Katty Kay on Influential (Credit: BBC)

On the heels of Going Infinite, his new book about beleaguered crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, Michael Lewis talks with the BBC about storytelling, money and his singular approach to grief.

Michael Lewis looks into a bookstore, flush with his works. He says it ""doesn't matter where the character is"" – you follow the story. He has indeed been on a journey through his prolific non-fiction catalogue, narratives that have taken him to Wall Street and back again, Silicon Valley and even baseball stadiums and American football fields across the US.

The best-selling author and long-time Vanity Fair contributor joins BBC correspondent Katty Kay on her series Influential for a candid conversation about his multi-decade storytelling career, plus his own major storyline: the tragic loss of his daughter, which left him grieving in unconventional ways.

Where to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch it live on Thursdays at 10:30 p.m. ET on the BBC News channel Stream the full episode on YouTube Listen to the interview on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Castbox

Throughout the past three decades, Lewis, 64, has often found himself in the centre of important – sometimes controversial – conversations, with more than a dozen books that trace the intersection of business and culture. His charge: distilling complicated subjects to a wide audience, with a character-driven approach that turns oft-opaque issues into human-centric, thrilling stories.

He began with Liar's Poker in 1989, which pulled back the curtain on his hustle in the rocky, heady world of 1980s finance at high-profile investment firm Salomon Brothers. Many of his titles have rocketed to best-seller lists, including Moneyball, which unpacks the statistics-driven strategy to build a championship baseball team on a shoestring; and The Big Short, the tale of 2008's subprime mortgage crisis, told through dark, even haunting humour. (Both books ended up as blockbuster films.)

Kay points out Lewis often takes on ""quite dense, quite nerdy"" subject matter. He sees it somewhat less starkly. ""I've gotten particularly interested in something and seen something about it that isn't obvious to the world in some way,"" he says.

Going straight for the details has always been his nature. Before becoming a writer, Lewis apprenticed as a cabinet maker, studied art history at Princeton University, worked at a prominent art dealership and guided wealthy American teenagers through Europe. As much as he loved the art world, he decided it wasn't sustainable, and pivoted to Wall Street – the experience he recounts in Liar's Poker.

In the back of his mind, however, he always knew he wanted to write. ""It just starts with the character and a situation,"" says Lewis of his approach to finding stories.

For his latest book, Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, he found the perfect personality in Sam Bankman-Fried, the cryptocurrency magnate who shot to prominence by founding crypto exchange FTX. ""[Bankman-Fried was] a socially maladjusted human being, who most of human history would have found no particular use for,"" he says. ""[He] went from being worth nothing to being worth 22-and-a-half billion dollars in 18 months, and then starts to change the world in all kinds of weird ways.""

The author's timing could not have been more apt; on the day Going Infinite hit stores, Bankman-Fried went on trial for seven counts of fraud and money laundering, for which he was convicted in November 2023. The book yet again vaulted Lewis to the top of conversation in the business world; mixed in with glowing reviews were criticisms from voices in the crypto space, who say Lewis put a biased, positive spin on Bankman-Fried. Going Infinite ""may be regarded as either the pinnacle or the nadir of his career"", wrote Gideon Lewis-Kraus in The New Yorker.

""Do you ever feel that they got close to your heart or into your brain, and therefore it's hard to be objective about them?"" Kay asks Lewis of the subjects he profiles.

""Yes. It's that almost always you develop a lot of feelings because there is feeling in the air after a while,"" he says, though he caveats this was not the case with Bankman-Fried. ""I've had that problem with other subjects because I know how sensitive and easily wounded they might be.""

Through his reporting approach, Lewis, indeed, sees many of the intimate details of their lives.

""You don't just talk to them, you do things with them. You don't just have an interview, you play paddle tennis, or you go on a trip, or you accompany them to their meetings. You learn so much about people when you cooperate with them,"" he says. ""The other trick is to force myself to look at the places where the character is least self-conscious, like your toenails. You know, it's not your face. You're thinking that's what people are looking at. Right? And so that's going to be very self-conscious. It's where you are thinking nobody's looking where it gets really interesting. I try to look when nobody's looking. I try to be where nobody is.""

In his personal life, Lewis has lived his own harrowing experiences. He had three children with his wife, iconic MTV news anchor and journalist Tabitha Soren. In 2021, their middle child, Dixie, died after a tragic car collision. When Kay asks how he honours Dixie's legacy, Lewis shares his philosophy on grief.

""I have a peculiar way of dealing with the death of my child. From the beginning, there was a pretty serious gap between what people expected me to feel and how I felt,"" he says. ""I'm realising there's a loss of love, that I don't feel guilt. I was a great dad, she had a great life and we loved each other. If you use the sports metaphor – which she would love to use – we left it all on the field, right? So, it wasn't like, OK, we lost, but it's not that we didn't try.' I kind of concluded that I think I have to approach this in a funny way, in the way I approach literary subjects.""

Watch: Michael Lewis on grief and the death of his daughter

He continues, ""Everybody has an unusual circumstance, a unique circumstance. It's partly how you're wired, and it's partly what your relationship was with the person you lost and probably how they died … This is going to be an individual sport, me figuring out how to live with the grief.""

After the loss of a child, ""how do you get to gratitude?"", asks Kay.

""The intensity of that pain I felt and still feel is in direct proportion to the power of the love I felt. I didn't just love my child – all three of my children, I feel the same way – I liked my child. It was a friendship and parenting relationship at the same time and I'm incredibly grateful I felt that way,"" says Lewis. ""The grief is so pure, like the sadness, it's not these toxic emotions. It's not anger, there's not guilt there's not whatever it is that you regret – those kinds of things that kind of eat at you – sadness doesn't eat at you, tears and laughter go together. You're in a different emotional space, when you're in tears and laughter than you are with anger, resentment and guilt. I'm grateful that the relationship was such that she's left me with tears and laughter.""

The experiences of both his personal and professional lives have led to a singular ability to weave narrative – and spot the next story worth sharing.

""Listen very carefully to the way people tell their stories. And you will learn a lot about them, you will notice patterns,"" he says. ""My children all say I'm the luckiest person they've ever known. One of the things they say is, 'Whenever we go to a restaurant, there's always a parking spot for you right outside the restaurant.' You know why that is? It's because I look for the parking spot, and I assume it's going to be there. Most people think the spot right outside the restaurant is going be taken. But I think it's going to be there. It's the narrative that is important.""","'Look when nobody's looking': How author Michael Lewis uncovers hidden storiesBy Jacqueline Schneider Features correspondentBBCMichael Lewis joins Katty Kay on Influential (Credit: BBC)On the heels of Going Infinite, his new book about beleaguered crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, Michael Lewis talks with the BBC about storytelling, money and his singular approach to grief.

The reopening of the La Tour d'Argent in Paris signals a new chapter in a spot with a very long and storied legacy.

The mythology around one of Paris's most famous restaurants, La Tour d'Argent, is legendary and far-reaching. The restaurant in the 5th arrondissement overlooks the Seine River and the Notre Dame Cathedral, and is often described as ""the oldest restaurant in Paris"" with a history that dates to 1582. It is famous for its signature duck dish, which is prepared theatrically in the dining room, and its 300,000-bottle wine cellar.

If the restaurant's claims are to be believed, it's here that King Henry III picked up a fork for the first time and popularised its use in France.

Its reputation has attracted a long list of powerful and influential diners throughout history, including Queen Elizabeth II, Theodore Roosevelt and John F Kennedy, as well as Charlie Chaplin, Salvador Dalí, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The 2007 Pixar animated film Ratatouille was also inspired in part by La Tour d'Argent.

So when the restaurant reopened in August 2023, after a 15-month renovation, it caused a major stir among the city's gastronomic glitterati, most of whom wrote glowingly about its renaissance, which now includes a ground-floor bar, luxury hotel suite, rooftop terrace and an open kitchen in the dining room.

But it also presents a renewed opportunity to reexamine some of the lore associated with the restaurant, which media reports have repeated unchallenged for decades – much to the wrath and indignation of some food historians.

The last time La Tour d'Argent closed for renovations was in 1936, when then owner André Terrail moved the restaurant from the ground floor to the sixth floor of the building on Quai de la Tournelle where panoramic, floor-to-ceiling windows offered sweeping views of the city. More than 85 years later, his grandson, also named André, has spearheaded a new chapter in the restaurant's long and storied legacy.

""Our number one goal is to extend the Tour d'Argent experience,"" the younger Terrail said in an interview in the restaurant’s new Bar des Maillets d'Argent, a polo-themed cognac bar in honour of his father and predecessor Claude, who was captain of the Paris polo team.

Our number one goal is to extend the Tour d'Argent experience

In the restaurant’s ""hall of fame"", a selection of autographs and photos of some of the restaurant’s most illustrious guests includes a small illustration of Ratatouille signed by director Brad Bird, who spent days at the restaurant sketching the dining room (Terrail recognised the lamps, cheese trolley and maitre d’s outfit in the film as their own).

An electricity bill for the Notre Dame Cathedral from 1955 also tells the story of how Terrail’s father Claude paid for the landmark's lighting bill at a time when the cathedral remained dark at night, in order to give his guests a nocturnal spectacle.

During my visit, Terrail was stopped regularly by diners who greeted him by first name as though they knew him personally, and he reciprocated with the graciousness of a host who had been groomed to enter the hospitality business his whole life. Until the age of 30, Terrail lived in the building and was a fixture: as a child, every Sunday he and his parents would sit at the corner table and tuck into a simple roast chicken lunch – a family ritual that held deeper meaning.

""My father would take me around, greeting the guests and would make sure I got a feel for what was awaiting me later,"" said the third-generation owner.

Because as much as the restaurant is a Parisian landmark, it’s also a family affair. Like the polo-themed bar for his father Claude, the new 150-sq-m, €8,900/night luxury suite, L’Appartement, honours the memory of his grandfather’s hotelier roots, Terrail said. Along with the restaurant, the elder Terrail helped open the hotel George V, now the luxury Four Seasons George V. It was also where his grandmother Augusta Burdel lived for a time.

In the upstairs dining room where chef Yannick Franques conducts his brigade in the new open kitchen, the signature dish, canard au sang (which translates to bloody duck) is prepared the same theatrical way the restaurant’s former owner, Frédéric Delair, made it in the 19th Century.

In keeping with tradition, the seared duck is held aloft with a fork and filleted tableside, and must not touch the plate as it’s carved, the way Delair did it. The carcass is then crushed in the famous duck press, and the ""bloody"" juices reduced with cognac and port wine into a rich and dark sauce.

The numbered ducks A Frédéric Delair tradition that remains unchanged is the numbering of every duck served at the restaurant, a clever business concept that was ahead of its time for conveying the idea that every meal is one of a kind. Guests leave with an embossed certificate bearing the duck's unique serial number as a souvenir. Franklin D Roosevelt reportedly consumed duck number 112,151 in 1929, while duck number 328 can be traced to 1890 and the dinner plate of Prince of Wales, future Edward VII. By the end of October 2023, more than 1,117,800 ducks had been served.

Perhaps equally important as the canard au sang is the restaurant’s 300,000-bottle wine collection, which includes a few historical pre-Revolution wines valued at more than €25,000. During World War Two, Claude famously saved his wine cellar from the Nazis by erecting a brick wall to hide the bottles.

It's tales like these that have helped build up the mythology of La Tour d’Argent. But two major claims – both of which have been central to the restaurant's fame – have been called into question by historians.

The first sticking point is the oft-repeated title of La Tour d'Argent as the oldest restaurant in Paris.

""That's a tall tale, it's not true at all, it's wrong,"" said Patrick Rambourg, a researcher at the Université Paris Cité and author of History of Gastronomic Paris, from the Middle Ages to the Present Day. ""The notion of a restaurant as an establishment in the 16th Century doesn’t work,"" he said. ""From the sources I’ve seen, I don’t see any mention of the Tour d’Argent until the 18th Century.""

For starters, Rambourg points out that the Western restaurant as we know it today (historians say the the world’s first restaurants actually popped up in China as early as 1100 AD) only made its first appearance in the 1760s and takes issue with the semantics often attached to the brand: the Tour d'Argent can’t be the oldest restaurant in Paris because there was no such thing in the 16th Century, he said.

In a 1969 interview on French TV, Claude Terrail addressed this discrepancy and described the site as an inn or tavern when it opened in the 16th Century, as ""restaurants came along a lot later.""

But that still doesn’t satisfy experts in regards to their second point of contention: the claim that Kings Henry III and Henry IV were patrons and that it was here, in its iteration as an inn or tavern, that Henry III introduced France to forks for the first time.

As Claude Terrail tells it in the same 1969 interview, Henry III was fed up with seeing members of his royal court soil their clothing and high collars, or ruffs, after every meal – an unavoidable consequence of eating with their hands. So he ordered a silversmith to make a dozen forks (already in use in Italy at the time) and hosted a dinner at the Tour d’Argent, where he introduced wider France to the fork.

But Rebecca Spang, author of The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomic Culture, points out that inns and taverns were patronised by travellers like religious pilgrims or merchants who had no other food options – not the elite and much less French royalty. ""It wasn't a luxurious experience,"" she said.

For Rambourg, the story also fails to hold up for similar reasons. ""Why would a king from that time stay at an inn or hostel in Paris when they had their own royal residences and palaces in the city?"" he asked.

Furthermore, Spang points out that the restaurant claims to have opened during the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants (1562-1598), when millions died during major upheaval, and questions the likelihood of French royalty staying in an unprotected rustic inn at this time.

For his part, the current owner André Terrail stands by the claims, saying that the writings in their possession date the building – whether it was a hostel or an inn – to 1582. ""Sometimes, history is transferred by word of mouth,"" he said. ""But there's probably as much chance that it's true as it is false.""

But Hélène Pietrini, managing director of the fine dining guide and global restaurant ranking La Liste, dismissed the focus on authenticating dates and superlative titles.

""I'm not on a museum tour. I'm eating a piece of French history and gastronomy,"" she said. ""You don't necessarily have to look at how many centuries a restaurant has existed, but instead what they represent in France's culinary heritage. And the Tour d'Argent is timeless.""

BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.

The Liverpool forward missed out on penalties in the 2021 Afcon final against Senegal, with former Reds team-mate Sadio Mane netting the winning spot-kick.

The defending champions are firmly among the favourites to lift the trophy but face threats from across the continent - with the unpredictability of the tournament underlined by the fact the past seven editions have produced seven different winners.

Morocco are Africa's top-ranked team at 13th in the world after their historic run to the semi-finals at the 2022 World Cup, while Nigeria can boast the striking firepower of African Footballer of the Year Victor Osimhen.

Hosts Ivory Coast are bidding for a first title since 2015 and Algeria will be searching for a vast improvement after crashing out as holders in the group stage two years ago.

""I cannot recall a stronger field,"" Senegal forward Mane, who now plays his club football in Saudi Arabia, said.

""All the giants are going to be in Ivory Coast and all of them will be plotting to dethrone us. I believe [this] Nations Cup will be the toughest to win.""

The 24-team format will see the top two in each of the six groups qualify for the last 16, with the four best third-placed sides also progressing to the knockout stages where the overall winners will pick up $7m (£5.5m) in prize money.

BBC viewers in the UK will be able to see 10 games live, including two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final on 11 February, while the World Football at Afcon podcast will have discussions rounding up every matchday.

The tournament was originally scheduled to be played in June and July last year, but has been shifted to early 2024 to avoid the rainy season in West Africa.","Mohamed Salah will be looking to captain Egypt to a record-extending eighth triumph when the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) gets under way in Ivory Coast on Saturday after finishing as a runner-up with the Pharaohs twice.

Antony: Man Utd winger has been affected by off-field issues, says Erik ten Hag

The form of Manchester United winger Antony has been impacted by off-field issues, says manager Erik ten Hag.

The Brazilian has been the subject of a police investigation after allegations of domestic abuse were made against him by three women, though he has not been arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.

The 23-year-old has no goals or assists in 21 appearances this season.

""I think his off-field issues stop him playing,"" said Ten Hag.

""They have had an impact on him, definitely, so he has to deal with that. So he caused them, so he has to sort them out. We will give him all the support but he has to do better.""

Antony became Manchester United's second most expensive signing when he joined from Ajax for £82m in September 2022, having scored 24 goals and provided 22 assists in 82 appearances for the Dutch giants.

He scored 10 goals and contributed five assists in 47 appearances for the Red Devils during 2022-23 and started the first four games of this season.

During the international break in September, Brazilian news outlet UOL published allegations made by Antony's ex-partner Gabriela Cavallin, which Antony denies.

Further assault allegations followed when Rayssa de Freitas and Ingrid Lana each claimed Antony assaulted them in 2022, which he denies.

United responded by saying they take the allegations ""seriously"" and granted Antony leave with full pay to deal with the allegations on 10 September.

He resumed training from 29 September having spoken to Greater Manchester Police voluntarily and returned to action in early October.

""First year he was OK, in the pre-season he was very OK, first four games [of this season] he was very good,"" added Ten Hag.

""But from the moment he was out and then he came back, he didn't deliver the performance we should expect from him and he can do so much better.

""His end product in Ajax was very high and he could return to that level. The Premier League is more difficult but he's capable of doing that.""

Ten Hag also wished Jadon Sancho good luck after his loan move to Borussia Dortmund was confirmed earlier this week.

The 23-year-old has been exiled from the Manchester United team since a public dispute with Ten Hag at the beginning of September.

""I hope he's doing well,"" he said. ""I wish him the best of good luck. That's it. I hope he's doing well and he'll be a success.""","Last updated on .From the section Man UtdAntony: Man Utd winger has been affected by off-field issues, says Erik ten HagThe form of Manchester United winger Antony has been impacted by off-field issues, says manager Erik ten Hag.
