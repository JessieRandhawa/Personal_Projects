Doctors say the death toll doesn't include bodies buried under rubble or those not taken to hospital.

The World Health Organization has called the figures reliable.

Weapons used

Military experts say the wide variety of bombs used by Israel - some as large as 2000lb - contribute to the scale of fatalities.

According to US intelligence assessments seen by CNN, Israel dropped more than 29,000 bombs on Gaza between the start of the war and mid-December, with 40-45% of these unguided.

Population density

What can make bombs even more devastating is that Gaza has a very high population density.

On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - similar to the average density in London.

What does Israel say?

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it takes steps to avoid harming civilians, including giving warnings before strikes.

It also says Hamas uses Gaza's population as human shields.

Fighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border earlier this week

Israel will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned.

Benny Gantz said the Israeli military would intervene if militants do not stop firing on northern Israel.

Time for a diplomatic solution was running out, he added.

Meanwhile, the head of the Israel Defense Forces said troops were in ""very high readiness"" for more fighting in the north.

""Our first task is to restore security and the sense of security to the residents in the north, and this will take time,"" Chief of the General Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said, after conducting a ""situational assessment"".

Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel.

On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched its highest number of cross-border attacks in a day since 8 October, security sources told Reuters.

It has led to concerns the conflict in Gaza could become wider across the region.

""The situation on Israel's northern border demands change,"" Mr Gantz told a press conference on Wednesday night.

""The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it.""

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on a visit to troops near the border that Israel would ""single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis"" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.

Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim organisation - is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.

Funded by Iran, it is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world.

In 2006, a full-blown war between Hezbollah and Israel was triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid, with Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon.

At the border, there has been an increase in rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah this week, with Israeli war planes quick to respond.

On Thursday, Israeli forces said they intercepted a drone crossing into their territory from Lebanon.

And on Wednesday, state media in Lebanon reported that a Hezbollah fighter and two of his relatives had been killed in an Israeli air strike.

The attack reportedly hit a house in Bint Jbeil, a town about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel.

A Hezbollah statement said one of the victims, Ibrahim Bazzi, was an Australian citizen visiting his family.

More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon since October - most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists, are also among the dead.

On the Israeli side, at least four civilians and nine soldiers are known to have died on the Lebanon border since hostilities began. Thousands of civilians living in dozens of communities in the area have been evacuated by the army.

Meanwhile, Unifil - the UN peacekeeping force that has operated in southern Lebanon since 1978 - called on Lebanese authorities to investigate after one of its troops was wounded in the country's south.

Unifil said a patrol was attacked ""by a group of young men"" in Taybeh, with a vehicle also damaged.

Hezbollah's leadership praised the unprecedented cross-border attack launched by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others were taken hostage.

More than 21,100 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","Israel Gaza war: Israel warns Hezbollah and Lebanon over border fightingBy James Gregory BBC NewsAFPFighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border earlier this weekIsrael will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned.

Nastya Ivleeva and Philipp Kirkorov were pictured during the party

This is Partygate: Russia-style.

What happened at a Moscow nightclub was bizarre. What happened next says so much about the current atmosphere in Russia.

On 20 December, blogger and TV presenter Nastya Ivleeva threw an ""Almost Naked Party"" at Moscow's Mutabor nightclub.

Dress code? More like an undress code.

Scantily clad pop stars and celebrities attended the soiree. Including Russian rapper Vacio [real name Nikolai Vasiliev]. He turned up wearing only training shoes and one strategically placed sock.

It was a private party. But it became very public when videos and photos appeared on social media. Overnight, Vacio's became the most famous sock in Russia. And not in a good way.

There was uproar. Pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who support the war in Ukraine, were furious: how could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the ""special military operation""?

For the revellers, the party was well and truly over. Rapper Vacio was arrested and jailed for 15 days for ""disorderly conduct"". He was also fined 200,000 roubles (£1,700; $2,200) for ""promoting non-traditional sexual relations"".

The organiser of the ""Almost Naked Party"", Nastya Ivleeva, is facing legal action. More than 20 people have signed a class-action lawsuit. They're demanding she pay a billion roubles (£8.5m) to the Defender of the Fatherland Foundation, an organisation that donates money to participants of the Kremlin's ""special operation"".

Other partygoers are facing the music, too.

Russian Eurovision veteran Dima Bilan insisted he was fully clothed and had no idea what other guests would wear

There's talk of concert dates being cancelled and advertising contracts terminated. Reports, too, that some of the stars are being edited out of pre-recorded New Year's Eve entertainment shows on Russian TV.

Big names - suddenly cancelled.

Cue the video messages.

One by one, the prominent party guests have been taking to social media - some to apologise for their attendance, others to insist they've done nothing wrong.

""I recognise I made a mistake,"" declared the now fully dressed megastar Philipp Kirkorov. ""The last thing I want is for such an event, my mistake, to result in restrictions on my career in Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen.""

""I wore a polo-neck, a big trench coat, trousers and shoes,"" said pop star Dima Bilan. ""I couldn't know in advance what the other guests would be wearing.""

Stephane Cardinale/Corbis

Until now, Philipp Kirkorov has been a staple of Russia's pre-recorded New Year's Eve TV schedule

""Тhey say that Russia knows how to forgive. If so, I would like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,"" said Nastya Ivleeva in her video message.

""If the answer is no, then I'm ready for my public execution. I won't shy away. I'm ready for any outcome.""

Events of the last few days will have come as a shock to these celebrities.

Following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they had taken the conscious decision to remain in Russia and continue their careers, and often lavish lifestyles, here. Public criticism was reserved for those anti-war celebs who had left Russia.

Not any more. But why?

It seems to me that Russia's political system, increasingly, relies on scapegoats. It needs groups or individuals it can point to and blame for problems at home and abroad.

Up till now, those scapegoats have included Ukraine, the US, the UK, the EU and Nato.

Now, it seems, some Russian celebrities are on the list.

In a social media post, this is how exiled Russian opposition activist Maxim Katz summed up events: ""In the past, there was a simple social contract with people who went to parties like this: do whatever you want as long as you stay loyal.

""But life is no party now. These ostentatious displays contrast with reality outside. You can't flippantly party in a country waging war.","Russian celebs at 'almost naked' party stung by backlashBy Steve Rosenberg Russia EditorInstagram/_AGENTGIRL_Nastya Ivleeva and Philipp Kirkorov were pictured during the partyThis is Partygate: Russia-style.

Blanchard family

Gypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee Blanchard

A woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard, 32, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Dee Dee Blanchard in Missouri in 2015.

She plotted with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother following years of abuse.

He stabbed Dee Dee Blanchard to death with a knife her daughter gave him and the pair fled the scene.

They were then arrested hundreds of miles away in Wisconsin where Godejohn lived. He is serving a life sentence without parole.

The case sparked intense media interest and spawned a number of documentary series and TV shows.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard walked out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri at 03:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Thursday having served seven years of a 10-year sentence.

While in prison, she gave a number of interviews detailing her mother's abusive behaviour and a memoir she wrote while behind bars is due to be published in January.

In a recent interview with People Magazine she said: ""Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.""

Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly abused her daughter for years by convincing her that she was disabled and required medical support.

She told people that Blanchard had multiple conditions including epilepsy, vision impairments and muscular dystrophy.

She received support from charities and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, often portraying her daughter as younger than she actually was and subjecting her to unneeded medical treatments.

Blanchard used a wheelchair, feeding tube and an oxygen tank even though she could walk and had no health issues.

She later said her mother kept her weak and isolated. Blanchard soon became more interested in the outside world, making a dating profile and meeting Godejohn.

""I wanted to be free of her hold on me,"" she said during Godejohn's trial. ""I talked him into it.""

She reached a plea deal with prosecutors due to the abuse she had suffered, which meant a 10-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty.","Gypsy Rose Blanchard released early from US prisonBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsBlanchard familyGypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee BlanchardA woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Elijah Blue Allman and Cher pictured in 2002

Cher has filed for a conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman due to his alleged substance abuse and mental health issues.

Court documents seen by the BBC claim Mr Allman, 47, is ""substantially unable to manage his financial resources"".

In the documents, lawyers for Cher say a conservator is ""urgently needed"" to protect his property and physical and mental health.

Cher's publicist has been approached for comment.

Mr Allman has not commented publicly on the legal filing. He recently posted the hashtag ""#imprisonmentviaconservatorship"" on an Instagram post.

A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.

It can be used to manage a person's financial affairs or personal affairs or both.

Mr Allman is due to receive assets from a trust before the end of the year.

The documents state he is entitled to regular payments from the trust set up by his late father, musician Gregg Allman.

The court papers, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, state Mr Allman is ""currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues"".

The filing adds: ""Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, [Cher] is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk.""

It says that Cher, 77, has ""worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs"".

A hearing for a temporary order is currently set for 5 January, with the hearing on a permanent order scheduled for 6 March.

Cher recently denied allegations that she hired four men to kidnap Mr Allman from a New York City hotel room.

The singer told People Magazine ""that rumour is not true"".

Cher was married to Greg Allman from 1975 to 1979. She was previously married to her former singing partner Sonny Bono from 1964 to 1975. She also has a child, Chaz Bono, from that relationship.

By Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, Sweden

Modvion

Engineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine tower

What is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

If that calls to mind flat-pack furniture and meatballs, you're wrong.

If you answered ""a wooden wind turbine"", you could be a visionary.

According to Modvion, the Swedish start-up that has just built the world's tallest wooden turbine tower, using wood for wind power is the future.

""It's got great potential,"" Otto Lundman, the company's chief executive, says as we gaze upwards at the firm's brand new turbine, a short drive outside Gothenburg.

It's 150m (492ft) to the tip of the highest blade and we are the first journalists to be invited to have a look inside. The 2 megawatt generator on top has just started supplying electricity to the Swedish grid, providing power for about 400 homes.

The dream of Lundman and Modvion is to take the wood and wind much higher.

Steel limitations

On the horizon near the Modvion project, several very similar-looking turbines are turning.

Steel, not wood, is the key material for them, as it is for almost all of the world's turbine towers. Strong and durable, steel has enabled huge turbines and wind farms to be constructed on land and at sea.

Modvion

The blades and generator from this 150m wind turbine in Skara, Sweden, are made of conventional materials

But steel is not without its limitations, particularly for projects on land.

As demand has grown for taller turbines that harvest stronger winds with larger generators, the diameter of the cylindrical steel towers to support them has had to grow too.

In a world of road tunnels, bridges and roundabouts, many in the wind industry say getting those huge pieces of metal to turbine sites has become a real headache, in effect limiting how tall new steel turbines can be.

Wooden turbine or sauna?

From the outside, there is little obvious difference between the Modvion wooden turbine and its steel cousins.

Both have a thick white coating to protect them from the elements and blades made primarily from fibreglass attached to a generator, which produces electricity when it turns.

It is only when we go inside the tower that the differences becomes clear. The walls have a curved raw wood finish, not unlike a sauna.

Kevin Church/BBC

Otto Lundman of Modvion shows Jonah the interior of the wooden turbine

The 105m (345ft) tower's strength comes from the 144 layers of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) that make its thick walls.

By varying the grain of each of the 3mm-thick layers of spruce, Modvion says it has been able to control the wall's strength and flexibility. ""It's our secret recipe,"" says company co-founder - and former architect and boat builder - David Olivegren, with a smile.

At the factory, on the edge of Gothenburg, the thin layers of wood have been glued and compressed together to make the curved sections. Those pieces are then taken on site, glued together into cylinders and then stacked on top of each other to make the tower.

""Wood and glue is the perfect combination, we've known that for hundreds of years,"" Olivegren says. ""And because using wood is lighter [than steel] you can build taller turbines with less material.""

David Olivegren of Modvion inspects a modular section of the wooden turbine tower in the factory

Lundman and Olivegren tell me their turbine's big selling point is that, by using wood and glue, towers can be built in smaller, more easily transported modules.

That will make it much easier to build really tall towers, they say, and to take the pieces to challenging locations.

However, Dr Maximilian Schnippering, head of sustainability at Siemens Gamesa - one of the worlds largest turbine manufacturers - says more pieces are likely to mean more trucks, more people and more time to complete the installation. He considers the modular system ""an advantage"" and that wooden towers can ""nicely complement"" steel towers.

Siemens Gamesa's efforts are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the steel it uses, he says.

Inside the Modvion tower, I am shown how the wooden modules have been stacked on top of each other and how they are held by steel fittings that are then glued into place.

""The industry wants to build turbines with a 300m [blade] tip height, which means a tower which is 200m or more in height. With modularity you can do that,"" says Lundman.

The wooden parts of the turbine tower are glued together on site

Steel could of course be modular too, with the cylinders cut up into smaller pieces, but the extra effort needed to then bolt the pieces together adds both to costs and to maintenance.

One of the investors in Modvion is renewable energy giant Vestas. It has installed more wind power capacity around the world than any other.

Jan Hagen, its chief technology officer for northern and central Europe, tells me they see ""tremendous potential"" in the market for taller turbines, with wooden turbines ""particularly well suited"" to play a role.

""What we find interesting about this is that its combination of an economically viable solution that addresses the transport bottleneck and a sustainable solution,"" Hagen says.

Negative carbon footprint

Though wind power is cheaper and cleaner than almost all other forms of electricity generation, making steel involves extremely hot furnaces and almost always the burning of fossil fuels. That means CO2 emissions - the main driver of climate change.

Modvion says using wood instead of steel eliminates the wind turbines' carbon footprint entirely, making them carbon negative.

That's because the trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere when they are alive and, when they are chopped down, the carbon is stored in the wood. As long as the wood doesn't end up rotting or being burned, the carbon is not released.

About 200 trees went into Modvion's turbine tower. They were the same species - spruce - that is used for Christmas trees and the company says they are farmed sustainably, meaning when they are harvested more are planted.

SSE Renewables, one of the UK's largest producers of wind power, told the BBC it was aware of Modvion's work and that it would be looking into wooden towers as ""an alternative technology"" to steel. However, many of SSE's projects are offshore, which can be reached using huge ships - meaning the modular transport benefits are less pronounced.

Modvion says it is hoping to build another even taller turbine soon and, if all goes well, it will open a facility that will produce 100 wooden modular turbines a year in 2027.

""The industry is currently putting up 20,000 turbines a year,"" Lundman says. ""Our ambition is that in 10 years time 10% of those turbines - about 2000 - will be wooden.""","World's tallest wooden wind turbine starts turningBy Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, SwedenModvionEngineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine towerWhat is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

By James Waterhouse BBC Ukraine correspondent

Satellite images showed the landing ship Novocherkassk docked at Feodosiya first on 5 December (L), then on 26 December

It was an explosion which filled the sky and lifted Ukrainian morale.

For Kyiv, the sight of Russia's Novocherkassk landing ship being hit in an air strike was a much-needed boost.

With Russia gaining the upper hand in recent weeks and the West's support stuttering, Ukraine has produced another dramatic missile strike in occupied Crimea.

Spectacular? No doubt. But was it significant?

""As a battleship, you might think it's not crucial,"" explains Alina Frolova, who was Ukraine's deputy defence minister between 2019-2020 and is now with the country's Centre for Defence Strategies.

""But we need to look at the full context, it's a step-by-step process.""

Both Ukraine and the UK now say that 20% of Russia's Black Sea Naval Fleet has been destroyed since the start of its full-scale invasion - no mean feat for Ukraine, a country whose navy barely has any ships.

Mostly, Russia's vessels have been destroyed with long-range Storm Shadow missiles supplied by the West.

Watch: Huge explosion as Russian warship hit by missile

That has diminished Russia's ability to launch missile strikes from the sea, and any possibility of it mounting an amphibious attack from the sea is even less likely. It has also unblocked ports like Odesa which has allowed Ukrainian and international cargo ships to travel along an unofficial route.

Frolova thinks this latest strike in Feodosia is a continuation of Ukraine squeezing Russian supply routes to Crimea, and therefore weakening Moscow's grip on the peninsula, which it has held since seizing it in 2014.

""It demonstrates Ukraine's Air Force can operate in the face of Russian air defences,"" she says. ""Ships like this are used to deliver ammunition and drones. Based on the detonation, there were a substantial number of explosives on board.""

Ukraine's Navy claims up to 80 people were on board too.

Land, sea and air

There are four ways Russia supplies Crimea, according to Serhiy Kuzan, co-founder of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre think-tank:

Over the Kerch Bridge, which connects Russia to Crimea

Through the land corridor Russia now occupies on mainland Ukraine

By flying cargo planes from Russia

By water through the Black Sea or Sea of Azov.

Kuzan is confident Russia will have felt this strike. He says because the Kerch Bridge was damaged from previous Ukrainian attacks, Moscow had to look at other means to supply the Crimean peninsula.

Reuters

Russia says the Novocherkassk was damaged, while Ukraine says it was destroyed (file image)

""Ships allow them to move large loads relatively quickly,"" he says. ""These large ships are intended for carrying up to 500 tonnes of people and equipment.""

The Novocherkassk was one of 12 Russian landing ships, according to Kuzan, of which he says Ukraine has now destroyed half.

Kherson, but bigger

Moscow is currently able to control the front lines in Ukraine. But Kuzan suggests these are not disconnected from Crimea.

""We can't separate the peninsula from the south of Ukraine, namely the occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,"" he says.

As with the liberation of Kherson city last year, Kuzan is optimistic the battles at the front could move in Ukraine's favour if they could eventually lessen Russia's air superiority and frustrate its supply lines to its troops.

This is exactly what led to invading forces retreating across the Dnipro river to the eastern bank in November 2022.

But this time we are talking about a lot more territory. And it is a different story in the east, where Moscow has captured almost all of the town of Mariinka.

Should Ukrainian land forces ever reach Crimean soil, the battle for its liberation would likely be bloody. By carrying out these missile strikes Kyiv is playing the long game by trying to make Russia's presence there untenable.

The problem for President Volodymyr Zelensky is, time is not Ukraine's friend. Some in the West want a faster return for the billions of dollars of aid they have provided so far.","Ukraine war: Does attack on Russian ship make a difference?

By Mike Wendling BBC News

Reuters

A Ukrainian soldier near the front line in Donetsk this week

The White House has approved another tranche of US military aid to Ukraine worth some $250m (£195m).

The latest package includes air defence, artillery and small arms ammunition, and anti-tank weapons, US officials say.

But it marks the last funding available without fresh approval from Congress, where talks have stalled.

Ukraine has warned that the war effort and its public finances are at risk if further Western aid is not forthcoming.

Amid a stalled counter-offensive in the east of the country and a little-changed line of control, Ukrainian officials are facing the prospect of a slowdown in aid from allies in Washington and Europe.

Although the Ukraine war effort has broad support in the US Congress, an agreement on further arms has been stopped by Republicans who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.

An emergency spending measure that would have provided $50bn for Ukraine and $14bn for Israel was defeated in the Senate earlier this month, with every Republican voting against it - along with Bernie Sanders, an independent who usually votes with Democrats but has expressed concerns about Israel's war against Hamas.

A subsequent visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to sway lawmakers.

Wednesday's announcement will see the weapons pulled from existing Pentagon stocks, a move which does not need Congressional approval.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement announcing the aid package that it was ""imperative that Congress act swiftly, as soon as possible, to advance our national security interests by helping Ukraine defend itself and secure its future"".

""Our assistance has been critical to supporting our Ukrainian partners as they defend their country and their freedom against Russia's aggression,"" he added.

Earlier this month a €50bn EU aid package for Ukraine was blocked by Hungary.

Ukraine is facing a $43bn budget deficit and officials say they may have to delay salaries and pensions for government employees if further aid from the West does not come soon.

""The support of partners is extremely critical,"" Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as the country's economy minister, said in an interview with the Financial Times on Wednesday. ""We need it urgently.""

The newspaper reported that talks were progressing on a smaller aid package that would not need Hungary's approval, which could be taken up in early February.

As funding has slowed from Ukraine's Western allies, Russian forces have continued to fight in the east of the country, where they seized a key town on Tuesday.","Ukraine war: US releases last military aid for Kyiv for nowBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsReutersA Ukrainian soldier near the front line in Donetsk this weekThe White House has approved another tranche of US military aid to Ukraine worth some $250m (£195m).

Watch: Haley leaves out slavery as a cause of US Civil War

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says the US Civil War was about slavery after facing criticism for not mentioning it as a cause during a town hall event.

A voter in New Hampshire on Wednesday asked her what caused the war.

Appearing startled by the question, she did not name slavery in her response.

""I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do,"" she said.

Her remarks were quickly criticised by the voter who asked the question. He said that it was ""astonishing"" that she answered without mentioning the word slavery in the year 2023.

""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" Ms Haley responded.

But after facing a blowback on social media, the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor acknowledged it as a cause on Thursday.

""Of course the Civil War was about slavery,"" she told CNN.

""We know that. That's the easy part of it. What I was saying was what does it mean to us today? What it means to us today is about freedom. That's what that was all about.""

Speaking to radio station The Pulse of NH on Thursday, Ms Haley also claimed the voter was a ""Democrat plant"".

The Wednesday event in Berlin, New Hampshire was a part of Ms Haley's push to win over voters before the early upcoming Republican primary election in the state.

Ms Haley has risen in opinion polls in recent weeks.

She faces her first test at the Iowa caucuses in early January. While she trails behind former President Donald Trump by a wide margin, she is neck-and-neck with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another high-profile challenger.

President Joe Biden was among the dozens of Democrats who criticised Ms Haley after her comments in New Hampshire. He posted a video of her exchange on X, formerly Twitter, with the caption: ""It was about slavery.""

Her Republican political opponents also seized on the controversy. A campaign account for Mr DeSantis shared a video of her comments with one word: ""Yikes"".

A number of civil rights scholars weighed in as well, saying the fight over slavery was a central cause of the Civil War.

South Carolina was the first state to secede during the Civil War and as a former state governor Ms Haley has faced questions about the issue before.

When she was running for governor in 2010, she described the Civil War as a conflict between two sides fighting for ""tradition versus change"".","Nikki Haley says slavery was a US Civil War cause after backlashBy Madeline Halpert BBC News, New YorkWatch: Haley leaves out slavery as a cause of US Civil WarRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says the US Civil War was about slavery after facing criticism for not mentioning it as a cause during a town hall event.

Colorado Republicans have appealed to the US Supreme Court after the state's top court ruled that Donald Trump was ineligible to run for president.

The appeal means he will remain for now on the ballot for the Colorado primary.

Last week, the ex-president was disqualified from running in the state for his alleged role in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.

Mr Trump is the Republican frontrunner and is expected to be the party's candidate for the 2024 US election.

In its appeal, the Colorado Republican Party's legal team accused the state Supreme Court of ""fundamentally changing the course of American democracy,"" according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

They added that the decision would ""distort"" the 2024 presidential election and would ""mire courts henceforth in political controversies over nebulous accusations of insurrection"".

Colorado is the only US state to strike Mr Trump from the ballot under a US constitutional clause called the 14th Amendment prohibiting anyone engaging in ""insurrection or rebellion"" from holding public office.

This was the first time this provision has ever been used since it was introduced after the American Civil War.

Voting 4-3, the state's top court found last week that the former president had incited an insurrection when the Capitol was stormed by his supporters. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the riot.

The ruling directed the Colorado secretary of state to exclude Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary on 5 March. But it does not stop Mr Trump running in other states.

Similar lawsuits to remove the Republican frontrunner from the ballot in Minnesota, New Hampshire and Michigan have failed.

It is unclear when the US Supreme Court will consider the case and make a decision. What it decides will probably apply nationwide.

Mr Trump's team are also expected to appeal against the Colorado ruling.

The primary elections are the state-by-state search by each party for a presidential nominee.

Donald Trump's campaign to win the Republican nomination will be complicated by a series of criminal trials in 2024 as he runs again for the White House.","Colorado Republicans appeal against Donald Trump's 2024 ballot banBy Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC NewsGetty ImagesColorado Republicans have appealed to the US Supreme Court after the state's top court ruled that Donald Trump was ineligible to run for president.

Fans tried to shield from the sun as they queued to get into the stadium in Rio

A 23-year-old fan who collapsed at a Taylor Swift concert in Rio de Janeiro in November died of heat exhaustion, post-mortem examinations cited in Brazilian media suggest.

Ana Clara Benevides Machado attended the first of Swift's Eras Tour show in the Brazilian city on 17 November.

A heat wave drove temperatures to 39C (102F), with the ""felt"" temperature reaching 59.3C, city authorities said.

Taylor Swift said at the time that she was ""devastated"" by the fan's death.

Video footage appeared to show the singer herself struggling with the high temperatures.

The artist cancelled the show scheduled for the next day after the fan's death, but went ahead with the remainder of the tour.

Psychology student Ana Clara Benevides Machado had travelled from the city of Rondonópolis to Rio to attend the concert.

Her friend, Daniele Menin, told G1 news site that the 23-year-old fainted during Swift's second song.

She was treated by paramedics on site before being taken to hospital, where she died.

According to the post-mortem report, she suffered a cardiovascular shock and bleeding of the lungs, which resulted in sudden death.

Her father told local media that he had never had any doubt that Ana Clara had died as a result of the extreme heat that day.

Around 60,000 people attended the concert at the Nilton Santos stadium in the city.

Nathalia Barbieri was one of those who braved the heat to see her idol.

She told the BBC she saw Ana Clara Benevides Machado being treated by medics after she herself had been rushed to the first aid post after fainting in the extreme heat and humidity.

By Matt Murphy BBC News, Washington

Reuters

Antony Blinken led the closed-door negotiations for the US side

The US and Mexico have vowed to crack down on migrant smugglers as a growing migration crisis causes chaos on their shared border.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador discussed how to stop the flow of people in talks held in Mexico City.

The high-level meeting came as pressure grows on the White House to stem the influx of migrants to the US.

US officials said last week that up to 10,000 people were crossing every day.

On X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Mr Blinken said the US is committed to resolving ""shared challenges"" with Mexico including ""unprecedented irregular migration flows"", drug trafficking and re-opening ports of entry.

Speaking to journalists on Mr Blinken's flight back to Washington, a senior Biden administration official said that Mexico's delegation shared plans to crack down on migrant smugglers, whom officials say have been moving migrants en masse to the border on trucks and trains.

""We were really impressed by some of the new actions that Mexico is taking, and we have seen in recent days a pretty significant reduction in border crossings,"" the official was quoted as saying by the Agence France Press (AFP) news agency.

The official added, however, that the US would ""never draw conclusions based on day-to-day fluctuations"" of migrant numbers and would continue to monitor the situation in the new year.

Mexico's Foreign Minister, Alicia Barcena, told reporters that the negotiations also focused on the ""economic part"" and the ""structural causes of migration"".

Mexico's president gave a positive assessment of the talks, saying on X that the two sides came to ""important agreements"" but offering few details as Mr Blinken left.

Speaking ahead of the summit he had called for more efforts to address the root causes of migration and warned that it could become a key issue in the 2024 US election.

Former president Donald Trump has taken an increasingly hard-line stance on the border and will reportedly unleash a massive crackdown on undocumented migrants if returned to office next year.

President López Obrador and Antony Blinken met in Mexico to address the spike in migration flows

The meeting in Mexico City came on the same day as the mayors of three US cities - New York City, Denver and Chicago - held a joint virtual press conference to address efforts to mitigate what officials have described as a migrant ""crisis"" in those areas.

Additionally, for the first time on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order requiring bus charter companies to provide 32 hours' notice of migrant arrivals in the city and limiting the times of day in which migrants can reach the city. Last week, 14 buses carrying migrants arrived from Texas in a single night, an all-time high.

The number of people apprehended at the US southern border exceeded two million, both in the 2022 and the 2023 fiscal years.

US Customs and Border Protection [CBP] officials said in a statement on Friday that there were more than 190,000 apprehensions in November alone.

The figures have become a political vulnerability for Mr Biden, with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives refusing to allocate new military funding to support Ukraine without a commitment to reinforce the border.

Ahead of the meeting attention in US media turned to a migrant caravan of about 7,000 people which is making its way towards the US from southern Mexico.

So far, the caravan - reportedly made up of migrants from Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Haiti and other countries - is about 1,000 miles south of the US border.","US and Mexico look to stem 'unprecedented' migrant flowBy Matt Murphy BBC News, WashingtonReutersAntony Blinken led the closed-door negotiations for the US sideThe US and Mexico have vowed to crack down on migrant smugglers as a growing migration crisis causes chaos on their shared border.

Donald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was made

Donald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The former president made a brief appearance in the 1992 film in a scene filmed at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time.

Director Chris Columbus said Mr Trump insisted on appearing in the film if they used the hotel as a location.

But Mr Trump said the filmmakers were ""begging"" him to appear.

""I was very busy, and didn't want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.

""I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time,"" he said. ""People call me whenever it is aired.""

""If they felt bullied, or didn't want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years?"" Mr Trump added. ""Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that's why!""

The initial comments from Mr Columbus were made in a 2020 interview with Business Insider, although they received renewed attention on social media over Christmas.

The director said Mr Trump sought a cameo appearance in addition to the customary fee to film in the hotel.

""We paid the fee, but he also said 'the only way you can use the Plaza is if I'm in the movie',"" Mr Columbus said. ""So we agreed to put him in the movie.""

He also said people ""cheered"" when Mr Trump was shown in screenings and that it became a ""moment"" for the audience.

But he added that he ""did bully his way into the movie"".

Mr Trump, however, said ""nothing could be further from the truth"".

In the film, protagonist Kevin McCallister - played by Macaulay Culkin - uses his father's credit card to check into the Plaza where Mr Trump helpfully gives him directions to the lobby.

Mr Trump has made dozens of cameo appearances in television series and films including Sex and the City, Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and Two Weeks Notice.","Trump denies bullying his way into Home Alone 2By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, WashingtonAlamyDonald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was madeDonald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The fish can grow to four metres in length and weigh 200kg or more

Guillermo Otta Parum has been fishing in the Bolivian Amazon his whole life, for more than 50 years.

At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

But then a giant freshwater fish arrived, known locally as paiche or Arapaima gigas, to give it its scientific name.

""I thought this creature was a water snake, that it would attack everything, that eating it would be bad for you, that it might be poisonous,"" he recalls.

In fact, it is one of the biggest freshwater fishes in the world, growing up to 4m in length and weighing 200kg (440lb) or more.

Guillermo Otta Parum has been a fisherman for 50 years

It is estimated that every year, the paiche spreads another 40km deeper into the rivers of the Amazon basin.

Federico Moreno, director of the Beni Autonomous University's Centre for Aquatic Resources Research, says its size and appetite make it a serious threat to native fish stocks.

""It is a territorial fish, it takes over a body of water and scares off the native species. [That] is one of the serious problems. The other species flee from the predator and enter other bodies of water much further away, more remote and difficult to access.""

No one really knows the exact year that the paiche first appeared in Bolivia.

It is generally believed its arrival was the result of a breach of a paiche fish farm in Peru, where the fish are native. From there, they spread into Bolivia's rivers.

Biologist Fernando Carvajal has spent years studying the Paiche

Fernando Carvajal is a biologist and expert on the paiche. He says they are a ravenous species.

""During the first years of life, the paiche grows at the rate of 10kg a year. That means the paiche is eating a lot of fish.""

Unlike other predatory fish like piranha, it only has small, not particularly sharp teeth.

But its lack of impressive teeth does not stop it from eating piranha and a host of other fish, along with plants, molluscs and birds, all of which it hoovers up like a giant vacuum cleaner.

It also frightens off any fish which tries to eat the paiche's young.

Fernando Carvajal says there is no firm data about the impact of the paiche, but he says that anecdotally, fishermen are reporting that the numbers of some native species are dwindling.

""In the next one or two decades, the paiche is going to spread to all the potential areas where this species can live,"" he warns.

""We know that around the world, most invasive cases are bad for nature. Invasive species are considered the second-biggest reason for the loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction.""

However, for local fishermen, the arrival of the paiche has been a boon. Having been initially afraid of it, it did not take long for fishermen to realize its potential, says Guillermo Otta Parum.

Paiche fishing boat on the Yata River in the Bolivian Amazon

""When I brought the first fish, I would give the customers small pieces as a gift for them to try so they would get a taste for it.""

Some fishermen even pretended it was a type of catfish to overcome people's suspicions about eating such a huge specimen.

Now paiche are eaten across Bolivia.

Edson Suzano runs a paiche-processing plant in Riberalta, a town in north-east Bolivia close to the Brazilian border.

Edson Suzano (left) says the paiche is affordable

""We sell it everywhere - supermarkets, markets. There are different cuts, so it is affordable. We buy and process around 30,000kg per month,"" he says.

The challenge for the fishermen is trying to find the paiche in the huge expanse of the Amazon.

The fish has a lung-like organ and has to come up for air regularly to breathe and so likes calmer water. It prefers to live in lakes and lagoons, but migrates when it feels it is in danger.

The paiche migrates when it feels it is in danger

Most of the fish Edson Silvano processes used to arrive by boat.

Now the fishermen travel to ever more remote areas to catch the paiche and have to transfer from boats to canoes, on journeys of up to two weeks. This is putting them in conflict with indigenous communities.

These communities have been given land titles to many of the remote lagoons where paiche are now to be found and have themselves started fishing for and selling the fish.

Now commercial fishermen have to obtain special licences to work in these areas. But fishermen like Guillermo Otta Parum say that even when they have the correct paperwork, they are often turned away.

The indigenous communities argue that they are only trying to protect the resources which the Bolivian government has recognised they have a right to control.

Juan Carlos Ortiz Chavez is a paiche fisherman who belongs to the Alto Ivon Tco Chacobo indigenous community:

He says that in the past, indigenous people were scared of commercial fishermen. ""But this new generation of young people has changed, because we have made our rules so that people can't come and take from us any more,"" he explains.

Scientists such as Federico Moreno hope that fishing generally, whoever is doing it, will keep paiche numbers in check.

""Keep hunting them, keep fishing for them all the time and that could keep a balance between the different species.""","At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Taiwan

Campaigning is in full swing for Taiwan's presidential election on 13 January

The December sun is baking on the Heng Chun peninsula, the tongue of land that juts out from the bottom end of Taiwan into the Philippine Sea.

A half-smoked cigarette pokes from the corner of Hsu Keng-Jui's mouth. He is part of a network of volunteers - most of them veterans like him - who track the now-constant presence of Chinese ships and aircraft just outside Taiwan's territorial limit.

Using plastic zip ties, Mr Hsu straps a long radio antenna to a steel railing, then sits down with his portable radios and begins to scan the military channels. At first all we hear is the soft southern lilt of the Taiwan coastguard directing sea traffic. Then a different accent and a different tone comes through the heavy static. It's the Chinese navy.

China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province. With just weeks to go, Beijing looms larger than ever before - on the ballot, and at Taiwan's borders.

""We represent all the people of China,"" the voice from the Chinese navy intones. ""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""

Dragging on another cigarette, Mr Hsu looks unmoved: ""I hear it every day now. It's like they're reading from a script.""

Another voice comes across the airwaves. It's the captain of a Chinese tugboat, just three miles off Taiwan's coast.

The captain has been asked to move out of Taiwan's territorial waters, but he refuses: ""What territorial waters are you talking about? Taiwan doesn't have any territorial waters!""

Mr Hsu is suddenly furious. He leaps up, grabs a handset and lets loose a stream of invective over the airwaves. He swears as he sits back down, muttering, ""Who does he think he is?""

Hsu Keng-Jui is a veteran who volunteers to track Chinese military intrusion into Taiwan's territory

For decades the governments in Beijing and Taipei had an unwritten agreement not to stray across a median line that divides the 110-mile-wide strait between them.

Now China is crossing it almost daily, at sea and in the air.

On one day in September the People's Liberation Army sent more than a 100 aircraft towards Taiwan, 40 of which crossed the median line.

This so-called ""grey zone warfare"" is meant to ""subdue the enemy without fighting"" to borrow the words of a legendary Chinese military strategist. In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.

""China is sending a very strong message to the United States and even Japan,"" says retired Admiral Lee Hsi-min, a former commander of Taiwan's armed forces. ""It's telling them that Taiwan is part of China. That this is our area so we can do whatever we want here. Meanwhile it's aimed at making Taiwanese people scared and making them capitulate.""

With Taiwan due to elect a new president on 13 January, the key objective is to undermine support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The island's current president Tsai Ing-wen is stepping down after eight years in power.

Beijing on the ballot - again

President Tsai, who has been candid yet deft in her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty, is deeply disliked by Beijing. But the man running to replace her, current vice-president William Lai, is far worse in their eyes. Despite saying he will do nothing to change the status quo, Mr Lai is seen by China as a hardline ""splittist"", an advocate of formal Taiwan independence.

Beijing's message to voters in Taiwan is that a vote for William Lai is a vote for war. It's also the message from the main opposition party, the nationalist Kuomintang or KMT. Their candidate Hou Yu-ih told supporters at a recent rally: ""Our whole generation will lose everything we have fought for during our lifetime [if Lai wins].""

But DPP supporters don't seem cowed. They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.

On a recent drizzly Sunday afternoon, around 60,000 DPP supporters crowded into a square in downtown Taipei to see Mr Lai and his running mate speak.

Then President Tsai stepped onto stage and the crowd came alive cheering and waving little, green DPP flags. Dotted among them were many rainbow flags of gay pride. Ms Tsai is adored by the LGBT community here for making Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.

Democratic elections aside, this is yet another thing that sets Taiwan apart from China. And it is one of many reasons DPP supporters are adamant this island will never be part of the People's Republic of China.

""I am very worried [about the threats from China], but I am not afraid,"" said Frederika Chou. ""Because I will volunteer to be a soldier and fight if they ever try to invade our beautiful country.""

""Some day we may have war, but I'm not afraid because I am Taiwanese, and I need to protect my country,"" said 27-year-old Abby Ding who'd come to the rally with her father all the way from Tainan in the south.

Beijing is far from the only issue on the ballot. Rising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate Ko Wen-je.

Once a DPP supporter, Mr Ko now positions himself as a middle-of-the road option between his main rivals - and one who can broker better ties with Beijing. While ""reunification"" was always a possibility, China's claims have now turned more urgent, especially with its leader Xi Jinping's repeated vows to take the island, with a deadline to boot.

The issue of how much Taiwan should prepare to fight divides the island's main parties. The current DPP government has invested heavily in new, domestically-built submarines and bought scores more F16 fighter jets and modern missiles from the US. It has reinstated 12-month-long compulsory military service and says it will do more if re-elected.

The KMT is much more ambivalent. Its candidate for vice-president, Jaw Shaw Kong, has labelled the submarine building programme a vanity project and a huge waste of money. Mr Jaw's family is from China, and he has long been seen as one of the most Beijing-friendly voices in Taiwan politics.

He says the only way to secure peace for Taiwan is to talk to Beijing, to reassure Mr Xi that Taiwan is not intent on independence, and that one day Taiwan and China can and should be united.

This is far from an unpopular opinion in Taiwan. The island's links to China, from family ties to trade, run deep and are tangled with complicated questions about the past and identity. It's an issue that often pits an older generation with stronger ties to the mainland, against young people who have grown up in a democratic, open society.

No-one will deny the military threat from China but they are divided over how best to deter it.

While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure.

Early one morning in December a group of Mirage 2000 fighter jets scrambled from their base on the west coast and roared out in to the Taiwan straits. The base is home to the 45 jets of Taiwan's rapid reaction squadron, tasked with confronting those Chinese aircraft daily probing the edge of Taiwan's airspace.

The jets were bought from France in the early 1990s and are now getting old. China is wearing down the Taiwanese air force, says retired admiral Lee. And they can feel the impact because maintenance has increased and ""it is actually affecting our capability"", he adds.

China can afford to fly as often as it likes. The People's Liberation Army has more than 2,000 fighter jets and is building many more. Taiwan has fewer than 300, many of them now over a quarter of a century old.

Military experts say that the wear and tear on the Mirage fleet is so high and the cost of fixing them so prohibitive that they've quietly stopped scrambling to intercept all but the most threatening of Chinese intrusions.

Taiwan's Mirage 2000 fighter jets are old - and they are being exhausted by Chinese incursions

The long game

The latest polling data suggest Mr Lai and the DPP are heading for victory in January albeit by a small margin. For the DPP it would be an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term, and a slap in the face for Beijing.

But the DPP will probably get less than 40% of the vote. That means there is still plenty to play for. Taiwan has a free press and an open internet. So the door is wide open for China's propaganda apparatus to target the 60% of voters who won't vote for the DPP. They will also be voting in a new legislature, which the KMT could win.

For years the main target of Chinese propaganda has been Taiwan's older population, particularly those with family ties to the mainland, people who have traditionally voted for the KMT.

""It's been very effective,"" says Puma Shen, an academic and political activist who has spent years studying Chinese influence operations around the world.

""If you look back in history, supporters of the KMT used to be very anti-Chinese Communist Party. But now they have become anti-Taiwan independence. They now believe people who support Taiwan independence are the ones who could trigger a war.""

A group of voters who used to think of the Chinese Communist Party as the enemy, now think the DPP is the real danger. It's not a rare view in Taiwan. Older Taipei residents speak disparagingly of President Tsai and her party as a ""bunch of troublemakers"".

But Beijing knows the key to success will be winning over young voters, those who have no party affiliation and are dissatisfied with both the old traditional parties. They are now being targeted through TikTok and YouTube. China has over 200 channels that are uploading videos daily.

""They are very good at finding out what young Taiwanese are interested in and then creating content to attract them,"" Mr Shen says. It's what he calls ""paving the road"". Once an audience is established and trust develops, pro-China messaging is then introduced.

Mr Shen's research has shown an increase in groups of young Taiwanese who are not pro-China, but have become increasingly anti-US and anti-Japan. Such influence operations are unlikely to yield any sudden embrace of China. But Beijing is playing the long game.","China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province.
""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""
In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.
They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.
While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure."

Naomi Campbell walked the runway at Alexander McQueen's Spring Summer 2024 show in the autumn

It's hard to look fashionable in a Christmas jumper covered in mince pie crumbs and spatters of mulled wine, so we're not here to make anybody feel bad this festive season.

But come spring, many of us will be spending way too much money on the hottest looks, in an inevitably fruitless attempt to look as good as the models on our Instagram feed.

Here are eight of the biggest fashion trends set to dominate 2024.

1. Polka dots

We counted every single polka dot at every fashion show this year, and can tell you that the total came to 12,487,396. The runways, in other words, were packed full of them.

The pattern is often popular in summer, but really the prints are a timeless and versatile trend which you're likely to see a lot of throughout the next year.

""Polka dots can be relied upon for elegance and impact,"" said the Telegraph. ""Spots are playful; they don't take themselves too seriously. Even the name, polka, suggests joie de vivre.

""This time around, we are making them our own. They're big and bold, they're imperceptibly small, they're punchy, they're muted... This is a print for everybody: it's genderless, classless, ageless and timeless. It's time to join the dots.""

2. Cherry red

With the exception of the annoying stone you have to spit out at the end, we love everything about cherries - and this season they provided the runways with a distinctive, vibrant and confident colour.

Some fashion houses put forward designs which were cherry red from head to toe, while others kept it limited to a skirt or jacket and combined it with other colours to make an ensemble.

""Fashion's obsession with bright red has been impossible to ignore in recent seasons, seen on the runway but also the red carpet,"" said Vogue's Alex Kessler.

""Spring/summer 2024 [collections] brought a noticeable shift towards deeper and more opulent versions of the shade.""

3. Metallics

Several designers took inspiration from the pipes under their kitchen sink for this next trend - a variety of outfits and dresses with a metallic sheen.

One of our favourite Met Gala themes of the last decade was 2016's Man vs. Machine, which saw A-list guests dress in silver, futuristic colours with robot-inspired accessories. Metallics became prominent once again in 2023 as fans dressed up for Beyonce's Renaissance tour.

The trend looks set to continue into next year and dominated during Paris fashion week, with Net-A-Porter noting: ""Swathes of shimmering metallics glistened across the SS24 runways.""

But if you're opting for gold, careful not to overload. ""Metallic gold can have a gladiator look,"" pointed out StyleCaster. ""If you want to tone it down, pair metallic gold with alternate materials like denim or leather.""

4. Knitwear

Let's get down to the knitty gritty: In the UK, the weather is so appalling that frankly a nice cardigan or jumper never goes out of fashion.

According to Who What Wear, the SS24 collections acknowledged that ""knitwear is a year-round staple, but one that should be no less fabulous than the rest of the items you wear"".

""Erdem's embroidered cardigans were some of the most beautiful pieces we saw,"" they added.

Elsewhere, W magazine suggested: ""Cardigans and fair isle knits were the most prominent knitwear trend this season.""

5. Snowflake patterns

We admit these beautiful and intricate designs are a bit more sophisticated than the snowflakes we made in school with some paper and a pair of scissors.

""Designers got crafty this season,"" noted Drapers, ""and the Paris runways were aflutter with super-size lace and broderie anglaise designs for SS24"".

(Don't worry, we've already Googled it, broderie anglaise refers to patterns with small round or oval holes cut out of the fabric, providing the snowflake look.)

Several of the outfits on display during fashion weeks saw the snowflake design put front and centre, while others displayed them through an outer layer of sheer.

6. Bows and ribbons

If you're reading this in a room surrounded by discarded giftwrap, make sure you scoop up those bows and ribbons before they reach the rubbish bin.

Giant bows showed up in the collections of several major designers during the various fashion weeks, so we could be seeing them adorn a variety of dresses next year.

""Oversized and opulent bows, spotted at shows like Sixdo and Aknvas, added a touch of whimsy to looks that were otherwise simple or unadorned,"" according to InStyle.

But not all fashion houses went for large and conspicuous designs - others opted for much smaller bows and ribbons to decorate, accessorise or tie together outfits.

""The dainty accessory creates a soft, romantic look no matter how it's worn, acting as garment detailing for a slew of different silhouettes,"" suggested Nylon.

7. Short shorts

If you already feel overloaded by the number of tabloid headlines which use the phrase ""leggy display"", then you may want to skip this one.

This summer will likely see an explosion in popularity for short shorts in a variety of colours, styles and fabrics.

""Those leg days at the gym are about to pay off,"" said Net-A-Porter, ""because if the recent runways told us anything, it's that seriously short shorts are set to be the ultimate power-dressing move come summer '24.""

8. Upcycled, pre-loved or sustainable materials

Arguably the most important fashion trend we could all adopt in the coming year is green. But not the colour.

Sustainability has long been a concern in relation to the highly-polluting fashion industry. A huge number of consumers buy something cheap, wear it a few times, and then chuck it out.

Tiny steps are being taken to address the industry's carbon footprint, such as the increasing popularity of websites which specialise in ""pre-loved fashion"", but many feel a great deal more needs to be done.

So we applaud the designers who are putting sustainability in the spotlight - either by changing their working practices, or by incorporating used materials into their designs.

Examples highlighted by British Vogue include Stella McCartney's use of Kelsun, a seaweed-based fibre that is said to have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional fibres.

Eckhaus Latta, meanwhile, showed a series of trousers that were 3D woven from yarn, cutting out the fabric-making process and reducing the amount of excess stock by making the manufacturing process more agile.

""Waste materials and deadstock are given a second life as new garments,"" said Fashion United. ""Materials destined for landfill are rescued and reworked. Pieced, patched, and layered together with imperfections and signs of wear and tear celebrated rather than hidden.""","Here are eight of the biggest fashion trends set to dominate 2024.

BBC

JS captured the zeitgeist of India's urban young in the troubled 60s and 70s

The nearly-forgotten JS, a cult youth magazine from the 60s and 70s, uniquely shaped the Indian teenager. The BBC's Soutik Biswas explores its near-defunct archives, revealing a magazine that vividly captured the hope and desperation of those decades in India with depth, wit, and vitality.

In 1975, intrepid Indian journalist Khalid Mohammed sneaked into Mumbai (then Bombay) international airport's transit lounge armed with a tape recorder, to meet Paul McCartney en route to Australia with his band, Wings.

The result was an interview brimming with drollery and repartee, as they talked about the rumours of a Beatles reunion, the future of rock music, and life with the Wings.

At one point, Mr Mohammed asked McCartney whether his music was becoming increasingly commercial.

""Our next album won't be commercial. It'll be experimental. Twenty-minute songs and backwards - just for you,"" the ex-Beatle quipped.

The freewheeling McCartney ""scoop"" epitomised JS, derived from Junior Statesman, a pathbreaking sibling to a prominent and upstart Kolkata-based (then Calcutta) newspaper. ""Anyone who was a teenager in India between 1967 and 1977 will not need persuading about the extraordinary impact that JS had on their generation,"" Shashi Tharoor, MP and author, told me.

JS sneaked into the Mumbai (then Bombay) international airport's transit lounge to meet Paul McCartney

Mr Tharoor should know. He made his writing debut at the age of 11 with a six-part World War Two adventure in JS, earning a ""princely sum"" of 50 rupees. ""I still meet middle-aged matrons who wax eloquently about the magazine, including people who can quote back at me from memory things I'd forgotten I'd written.""

When JS exploded onto the scene in February 1967, featuring The Beatles on its first cover, it quickly captured the zeitgeist of the urban youth of a nation grappling with shortages, rising prices, and joblessness. It was a grim and austere time. There was no TV, save a lone, uninspiring black-and-white channel; the young read books and listened to music, while most papers and magazines were pedantic and mundane.

Under the leadership of Desmond Doig, an India-born Anglo-Irish artist and writer, and previously a roving reporter for The Statesman, JS magazine was run by a bunch of enthusiastic college graduates. It swiftly gained a reputation as an irreverent, chatty, insightful magazine, always engaged with its reader.

""Before JS, it was assumed that children became adults overnight. JS recognised that there was a whole in-between identity with its own canon,"" says journalist and author Bachi Karkaria, who made her writing debut in the magazine as a teenager.

The colourful weekly covers were a vibrant blend of the global and local: kaleidoscopic pop-art illustrations; images of Bollywood stars such as Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor cheek by jowl with those of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles; and the exuberant colours of the folk arts of Bihar state. A special attraction were large fold-outs of teen icons. ""JS wasn't just a magazine, it was a happening,"" wrote Jug Suraiya, a prolific writer for the magazine, in his memoirs.

'We are not very rich people,' Amitabh Bachchan told JS, which spent four days with the actor for a cover story

And Bollywood heartthrob Rishi Kapoor told JS that he was 'in love all the time'

Quirk was always a few covers away: The Day The Martians Landed, screamed one headline, with two alien spaceships looming dramatically; or ESP: Fact Or Fiction, as part of a series of ""eternal controversies"". The sensibility of the articles, according to Mr Tharoor, ""alternated between Seventeen magazine and Hunter S Thompson on a (relatively) sober day.""

Not surprisingly, there was seldom a dull moment.

In 1975, helped by ""unimpeachable sources"" JS ""surreptitiously"" tracked down George Harrison in Kolkata, where's he was on a 30-hour-visit as part of a ""pilgrimage of holy places"" in India.

CY Gopinath, the magazine's meticulous reporter, wrote that the music superstar spent time meditating, going through ""yogic postures"", ""counting beads on a rosary"", visiting temples, ordering an image of Hindu goddess Kali, and having Bengali food for lunch at a friend's place.

A serialised London travelogue carried this illustration by JS artist Deb Mahalonobis

He even managed to snatch a two-minute conversation during which Harrison answered half a dozen questions, had seven pictures taken, and gave an autograph. The magazine carried a picture of the long-haired musician with the caption: ""George Harrison has gone Hindu pilgrim.""

There was no dearth of controversies. Fusion music pioneer Asha Puthli, crestfallen after a concert in Mumbai in the aid of the hungry, told the magazine that most of the audience ""seemed more interested in eating 'phoren' (foreign) food"".

""To add to it, the sound system was bad. I actually cried, you know.""

Then there was Bollywood. ""We are not very rich people,"" Amitabh Bachchan told JS, which spent four days with the actor for a cover story. Mr Gopinath, the keenly observant correspondent, wrote he didn't quite believe the star because he saw the ""Toyotas and Merces in [his] leafy driveway, the smell of Aramis after shave in the crowded make-up room, the numerous packs of Dunhill cigarettes, the lunchtime talk of days spent shopping in Piccadilly [Circus]"".

JS was also ahead of its times in many ways. At a time when few Indians could afford to travel abroad, the magazine went to New York and London, publishing long travelogues with illustrations and pictures - ""If London can surprise with serendipity, New York can baffle with elusiveness,"" said a florid piece.

Years before leading newspapers started inviting celebrities to guest-edit for a day, JS gave actor Jalal Agha the reins as editor ""for half an hour"". During this brief stint, Agha playfully ""stomped around the office like a crazed, plump Bugs Bunny, causing havoc, despair, and semi-permanent damage"" - a whimsical episode vividly captured in a series of gleeful pictures.

In 1976 JS did a deep dive into India's first underground metro in Kolkata which took 12 years to build

At a time when vivid reportage in the mainstream media was scarce, JS reporters filed reports from far-flung places making hand-woven carpets, denims and silk saris. JS covered the Dalit Panthers' efforts to break caste barriers in Bombay, sent reporters to rain-drenched Naxalbari to cover a 1967 Maoist rebellion, and travelled to Bhutan for the coronation of a new king.

To find out how the other India lived, JS spent a few days in a dusty hick town in central India. Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, as described by the magazine in 1975, had ""a dusty, crowded cow-dung splattered bazaar, small stucco houses and a social hierarchy as rigid and fierce as the summer heat"".

In 1976, the magazine carried a deep dive into India's first underground metro, being built in Kolkata - the metro took 12 years to build. The prolonged excavation found ""an old pair of handcuffs, a number of bullet shells, believed to be some wide misses from some World War II target practices, and a handful of not-very-old gold coins"". There were rumours of gold being found. Dug up neighbourhoods appeared ""temporarily anaesthetised, deprived of life blood"".

Long before shouty TV debates became a TV staple, JS featured periodic faceoffs between opposing views. Preceding the trend of opinion polls, it introduced 'We took Ten,' where 10 randomly chosen young people voiced their opinions on various topics. And long before celebrities became media contributors, Bollywood's Rekha, Zeenat Aman, and Simi penned beauty and advice columns for JS.

A fashion spread in the magazine in 1974

The 60-page weekly was packed with surprises. It organised events called 'JS Happenings' where its mascot, a 1932 Ford vintage car painted in psychedelic colours, would be displayed. Then there was a barter column called JS Exchange. ""Sixteen, female, likes Ravi Shankar, Rolling Stones and Rajesh Khanna.

Critics sneered that JS was ""frothy and un-Indian, that it encouraged young Indians to 'ape the West' by wearing jeans and listing to pop music"". Mr Suraiya spiritedly defended the magazine: ""JS spoke to a certain urban educated cultural sensibility that was in a sense, Westernised, but it was shaping a distinctly Indian cosmopolitanism"".

The end came brutally and abruptly, out of the blue in 1977, for reasons that are still not clearly known. Despite having around 40,000 paid subscribers and numerous readers, The Statesman chose to cease publication of its sibling, hastily halting the presses during the printing of an issue featuring a cover story on tea gardens. ""JS crystallised what it meant to be an Indian teen - and left that class floundering when it was unceremoniously, even pettily shut down after creating a never-before-genre of journalism,"" Ms Karkaria said.

Mr Suraiya, the magazine's most prolific and peripatetic writer, wrote the epitaph for a dream that died young.

""If I had to use one word to describe the JS it would be Camelot. The promise of a once and future kingdom, the kingdom of youth.""

""We shall always remember when we were young. And when young no longer, we shall know that youth itself always lives on. Forever ending, forever enduring, with its astonishment, and its anger, and its pangs of joy sharp as pain. That is what JS was, and is, and always shall be.""","JS: The iconic magazine which 'invented' the Indian teenagerBBCJS captured the zeitgeist of India's urban young in the troubled 60s and 70sThe nearly-forgotten JS, a cult youth magazine from the 60s and 70s, uniquely shaped the Indian teenager.
Under the leadership of Desmond Doig, an India-born Anglo-Irish artist and writer, and previously a roving reporter for The Statesman, JS magazine was run by a bunch of enthusiastic college graduates.

""We are not very rich people,"" Amitabh Bachchan told JS, which spent four days with the actor for a cover story.

By Sue Mitchell & Ben Milne BBC News

Carolyn Stephens

When her elderly father found a new partner, Carolyn Stephens was stopped from seeing him, and then left helpless as he vanished from her life.

In 2012, Carolyn waved goodbye to her 78-year-old widowed father as he headed off to Cyprus on a package holiday for older people.

Vincent Stephens was comfortably retired after a successful career as an electrical engineer.

On his return, he introduced Carolyn to Iris, a 75-year-old woman with whom he had struck up a friendship on holiday.

Carolyn, his only child, quickly became worried by this new relationship.

Vincent sold his house in 2014, in the Suffolk village where he had lived since retirement, and bought a new home 30 miles away in Norfolk, to be close to Iris.

Carolyn suspected that Iris was trying to separate him from his family, as well as the friendship network he had built up over the years in Suffolk.

""It was actually really distressing for my dad,"" she says. ""I remember one conversation where she was shouting at him that he didn't love me. And he was saying yeah, of course I do. She's my daughter - of course I love her.""

Vincent told his daughter he could not work out why she and Iris did not get on.

His brother-in-law, Brian, says Vincent seemed happy with Iris when they were first together, but that he became more concerned as he saw how Carolyn was being pushed out of Vincent's life: ""He loved his daughter so much, so how he felt when they lost touch I don't know, but I saw how concerned Carolyn was about it.""

Vincent's sister-in-law, Sheila, also had misgivings about Iris: ""She wasn't over-friendly, and I don't know whether she thought [Vincent's family] were competition,"" she says, ""but she seemed very jealous of Carolyn's relationship with her dad.""

Carolyn was also worried that her father's mental state was deteriorating, and that he was showing early signs of dementia.

""Dad got more fragile. He was forgetting to get his car insured, he was missing appointments.""

In 2018, Carolyn accompanied Vincent to an appointment with his GP, who assessed him for possible cognitive decline. The test was inconclusive, but there were causes for concern, and the doctor recommended further investigation.

But Vincent did not turn up for a second appointment, and subsequent follow-ups were cancelled. Dr James Warner, a specialist in the field, says this is a common problem.

""Most people with dementia do not know that they've got dementia,"" he says, ""And so, they're not going to… go to the GP and say, something's wrong.""

Meanwhile, a quick succession of events was causing mounting alarm for Carolyn.

Within a day of his missed appointment, Vincent had moved in with Iris, and then, a few weeks later, she had taken him to a register office to be married.

However, the ceremony did not take place because the registrar was so worried about Vincent's mental state.

""He couldn't answer even basic questions about his own address, his bride's date of birth, where or when he was supposed to be married,"" says Carolyn.

Even so, that same week, Carolyn learned that Iris had won power of attorney over Vincent's affairs. She now had the legal right to act on his behalf in both financial and property, and health and welfare affairs.

Anyone giving away power of attorney must have enough mental capacity to understand the consequences of what they're doing, and must not be coerced into signing. But the system is open to abuse, says Dr Warner.

Finding My Father

The remarkable story of how an elderly former engineer in his 80s was taken from his family and kept hidden for four years, and the long search by his devoted daughter to track him down.

Broadcast 13:30 GMT, 31 December on BBC Radio 4 - or listen on BBC Sounds

""I've had a case where I've been asked to assess someone's capacity to sign a lasting power of attorney for property and finance. My conclusion was that they did not have mental capacity. And the family said, 'oh, don't worry, we'll get someone else to sign it'.""

Within days, Vincent's house was put up for sale. But, worse was to come - something Carolyn had never anticipated.

Iris complained to the police that Carolyn was harassing Vincent, and that he wanted nothing further to do with his daughter.

""The police [told] me that I couldn't contact my dad again, because I was abusing him,"" says Carolyn. ""I called back and said, could you tell me exactly what I'm supposed to have done? And they couldn't.""

Carolyn was concerned for her father's welfare, but the call from the police - and the threat of further action - made her very worried about calling him.

In early 2019, she had an email from her father, saying that he had been hospitalised following a fall. Neither Carolyn nor any of her family members had been told about the accident.

During a visit to Vincent in hospital, she witnessed Iris telling him that he had to choose between his family or her.

Carolyn was told soon after that - despite being diagnosed with dementia while in hospital - her father had signed a GDPR form, preventing any information from being shared with his daughter. A few months later, she was told that his house had been sold, and emptied of his possessions.

Over the next few years, Carolyn's family and friends tried calling Vincent at Iris's house. They were told variously that he was out, asleep or did not want to talk - and then the phone was usually put down on them.

""We were sending birthday cards, Christmas cards, in the hope that they would reach him,"" says Carolyn. ""And we learned later that none of those cards had ever reached him. He had no idea that people were still trying to get hold of him.""

Carolyn did not see or hear from her father for almost four years. For some of that time, she did not know if he was even alive.

In May 2022, Carolyn discovered that Iris had died. Family members tried contacting Iris's family to find out where Vincent was, but without success.

When the registrar confirmed Iris's death to Carolyn, she saw that her father was no longer listed as living at her address. But where was he?

Sheila called Iris's home again and was told by a man that ""he could not help her"" - before putting the phone down.

The family alerted the UK National Missing Persons Unit, and Carolyn started her own search for Vincent.

Every three months she would check the newly released national register of deaths, which is updated every three months, hoping against hope not to spot her father's name there.

""It was harrowing,"" she says, ""but I had to keep looking. I needed to know whether Dad had died. I needed to know because at least that would have given me some closure.""

Carolyn also started looking through the electoral register. She could not find his details anywhere on the online version, so she turned to the more detailed full register, which is held on paper at the British Library in London.

Carolyn and her husband began combing through the names and addresses of everyone in Norfolk - the county where Vincent was last known to have been living. With a voting population of 700,000 in 2022, this was no easy task.

Emma Lynch/BBC

For almost a week, they checked every single page of the records, and then Carolyn finally saw her father's name, ""in a tiny little care home in the middle of nowhere"".

Carolyn says it was one of the happiest moments of her life: ""The librarians had to tell me to be quiet… because I was running around, going, 'I found him, I found him!'""

She discovered that Vincent had been put in a care home just as the Covid lockdown began, in the spring of 2020, and had later been moved on to another. When Carolyn arrived, she saw hardly any personal effects in his room, and staff said he'd had few visitors.

""Only a single painting from his house remained, not a single picture of his family,"" she says. ""Staff at the care home did not know about his love of opera music, they had no idea that he had a daughter, and a huge network of people who loved him and were so worried about him.""

When her father saw her, he waved his arms in the air and shouted ""surprised!"" - it was all he could say. His dementia was so advanced that he couldn't communicate in any other way. But it was enough for Carolyn, who rushed to his bed and hugged him.

""I will never forget it. I was really nervous because I thought he might not recognise me after all that time. But he couldn't stop smiling, he had a huge grin, you know. It was just lovely. It was unbelievable really.""

Carolyn is still trying to piece together what happened in the years between.

In 2012, Vincent had £50,000 in savings and a house worth £250,000. By the time he was found in 2022, he had no home, few possessions and just £83,000 in the bank.

The experience of what happened to her father has led Carolyn to believe that better legal protections are needed for vulnerable older people.

Carolyn says that if her father had been able to cast forward and plan for what might happen to him, an early diagnosis of his dementia, and maybe an early power of attorney in her favour to protect him, it would have been more difficult to shut out her and her family.

She is also worried that the new Powers of Attorney Act, aimed at streamlining the process in England and Wales, may make older people more vulnerable: ""It's similar to changing a will or getting married… and actually, it's even more powerful.""

Vincent died in June this year, six months after he was reunited with his daughter.

Vincent Stephens died in June 2023

""We were able to have a really simple memorial in the same place where Mum is buried,"" says Carolyn. ""And it almost seemed like nothing had happened - that these last five years were gone.""

She says that people ask her how she kept going through that time. She says it was because Vincent was her father. ""I was not going to let him die thinking that I had stopped wanting to see him and care about him. He looked after me all my life, and I just never ever wanted him to think that I'd abandoned him.""

The BBC has approached Iris's family for comment, but has received no reply.

By Kayla Epstein BBC News

President Joe Biden's policies toward Israel's conflict in the Gaza Strip are unpopular among young voters.

The 2024 presidential election promises to be one of the most polarising political contests in living memory. But as the war in Gaza rages, President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel is putting him at odds with some of his key supporters - younger voters.

Abdul Osmanu, 22, is not sure he can cast a ballot for President Joe Biden again. Much of that hesitation, he said, involves the Biden administration's support of Israel as it continues to bombard Gaza.

""As a lover of peace, a Muslim, and a black man, it's terrible to see the repression of the Palestinians,"" said Mr Osmanu, who was elected to his local town council in 2021. ""It'd be tough for me, in my conscience, to vote for a president aiding and abetting that in many ways.""

The young Connecticut voter told the BBC that he was weighing whether to vote for a third-party candidate or leave his presidential ballot blank in 2024. The decision is difficult, however, as he - and many other young voters - do not want to see Donald Trump elected again.

An increasing number of young Democratic voters, like Mr Osmanu, appear to be breaking with President Biden over the issue of Israel and the conflict in Gaza. It is a cause for concern for Democrats, as their opposition to Mr Biden's policies could threaten a key pillar of support that the elder statesman leaned on during the 2020 election.

Rhonda Caldwell

Abdul Osmanu said he was unsure whether he could vote for Joe Biden again.

For the past two months, young voters have seen in the news and on social media images of war and destruction from within Gaza. They have followed the death toll as it climbed to over 20,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

At the same time, they have watched as Mr Biden publicly backed Israel's stated effort to eradicate Hamas after they and allied groups killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October. It continues to hold an estimated 100 hostages in Gaza.

The BBC reviewed polling research and spoke to six young Democratic voters and organisers from across the US. Data and interviews appear to show a growing sense of political discord among young voters ahead of the 2024 election.

The Biden campaign declined to comment.

But registered voters aged 18-29 said they were more likely to support the Palestinian cause over Israel, a recent New York Times/Siena poll suggested. According to the survey, voters aged 18-29 had critical views of Israel and its counteroffensive against Hamas across the board, while older generations had more favourable views of the country.

Though a clear majority of registered voters - 57% - disapprove of the way Mr Biden is handling the conflict, young voters have the greatest objections. A total 72% of voters aged 18-29 disapprove of Mr Biden's efforts, the Times/Siena poll indicated.

Anna Bosking, a 22-year-old Iowa native, plans to vote for Mr Biden again. But after taking a Middle Eastern politics course at university, speaking to classmates from Gaza and seeing eyewitness accounts on social media, she has become more critical of America's relationship with Israel.

""Before this conflict I always thought Israel was a consistent ally that we would always support, and I never had any issues,"" she told the BBC. ""But I think the American people have been forced to consider the historical context in the situation.""

One possible reason for the divide is that young Democrats, particularly progressives, are also more likely to connect the cause of Palestinian statehood to the fights for social justice playing out in the US.

""A lot of the organisations that I'm present in have made strong connections to what the Palestinians experience, and want to continue to uplift their struggle,"" said Michael Abramson, the 25-year-old policy director of Young Democrats of Maricopa County in Arizona.

Mr Abramson organises in a key Arizona county for Democrats. He said he was confident the youth would turn out in Arizona for other candidates and ballot measures - such as abortion - but he said he was unsure whether he and others would vote for the Democratic nominee, whom he called ""the lesser of two evils"".

Democrats relied on young voter turnout to propel them to victory in the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms. The Democratic apparatus typically pours millions of dollars into youth outreach and engagement to shore up support.

Multiple young voters told the BBC that they were torn over the 2024 election, despite seeing Joe Biden as the ""lesser of two evils"" when compared to Donald Trump.

And not all young voters criticised Mr Biden's position towards Israel.

Jessica Schwab, a 20-year-old student at Columbia University in New York, said she did not want to see Mr Trump re-elected and thought Mr Biden was handling the conflict well.

""He's standing with Israel and providing them with military supplies, and general funding in their defence,"" she said. ""But I do like how he is also asking for humanitarian pauses, and inserting some sort of breathing room to reduce the amount of casualties that are occurring in Gaza.""

Mr Biden's backers also argue that the 2024 election is nearly a year away, and that young Democrats would come back to the fold if presented with a choice between Mr Biden and Mr Trump.","Israel Gaza: Angst grows among young voters over Biden's policyBy Kayla Epstein BBC NewsGetty ImagesPresident Joe Biden's policies toward Israel's conflict in the Gaza Strip are unpopular among young voters.

By Jo Palmer BBC South Investigations

Christianne Ireland

Christianne's father - Innes Ireland - won the Grand Prix when she was three years old in 1961

The daughter of a Formula 1 legend has described how she went from jet setting to homelessness before turning her life around.

Christianne Ireland grew up following her father Innes Ireland around race tracks, spending her days with champions like Stirling Moss and Graham Hill.

But in 2016 she said she found herself homeless and addicted to alcohol.

She credits volunteering at a small allotment with saving her life.

Recalling the first years of her life with her father, she said it was like ""living in a circus"".

""Obviously Stirling was his greatest friend. Frank Williams would pop round and it would be we're going over to Stirling's for supper and I'd be put in the car and off we'd go,"" she said.

""Everybody's door was open, unlike Formula 1 now.""

But after years of owning cars like Aston Martins and travelling the world, she ended up with just one suitcase outside a homeless shelter in Andover, Hampshire.

""It was like falling out of an ivory tower,"" she said.

Christianne said volunteering in a small allotment saved her life

At the time she was 58 years old, had faced two divorces, was addicted to alcohol and had no choice but to move from her former home in Berkshire.

""From eight in the morning I would have to be out of the hostel. I wasn't streetwise. I didn't know anyone there,"" she said.

""The main part of my day was making sure I didn't go and have a drink because once that started all hell would be let lose.""

As part of her recovery from alcoholism, Christianne was encouraged to volunteer for Hampshire charity Unity. She began helping out at a small allotment in Andover.

""On the days it was really bad and I wanted to go out and pick up a drink all I had to do was put one foot in front of the other and get to the allotment,"" she explained.

Christianne Ireland

Christianne and her parents lived a jet set lifestyle

The allotment soon gave her a glimmer of hope and after a few months she managed to find a job and rent a flat.

Now the 65-year-old works as a support manager for Unity and helps oversee a food pantry project.

""I grew with the allotment,"" she said.

Arriving in Andover was one of the toughest periods in Christianne's life. But she also believes losing everything made her a better person.

""In a way I look at it on hindsight as a snake shedding its skin and I then found me,"" she said.

Christianne is encouraging other people to consider volunteering as a New Year's resolution.

""It's never too late to make a change. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and things will happen,"" she added.

Taylor Swift has three albums in the UK's best selling vinyl this year

UK sales of vinyl LPs have hit their highest level since 1990 as the revival of the physical music market continues.

Sales rose by 11.7% to 5.9 million units, increasing for the 16th year in a row, according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) trade group.

Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) was the best-selling LP, followed by the Rolling Stones' Hackney Diamonds.

Cassette sales also did well, topping 100,000 for a fourth consecutive year.

While more than four-fifths of recorded music is consumed via streaming, vinyl has made a huge comeback, with fans seeing it as more collectible and having better sound quality.

The BPI, the trade body for the UK music industry, said the popularity of independent record stores and the rebirth of specialist music chain HMV had also helped.

HMV, which stands for His Master's Voice, re-opened its flagship shop on London's Oxford Street in November after a four-year hiatus.

New releases dominated the list of best-selling vinyl albums, with Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi and Lana Del Rey also in the top 10.

However, classic albums and reissues were also among the top performers, including Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and Pink Floyd's the Dark Side of the Moon (Live At Wembley 1974).

Taylor Swift has three albums in the UK's top 10 best-selling long-players this year - 1989, Speak Now and Midnights.

Speak Now and 1989 are both re-recordings and are part of an ongoing campaign to regain control of her work, after an investment company bought her master tapes in 2019.

Last year, she told the BBC's Graham Norton Show: ""I've been recording my first six albums because there was a thing that happened where I had wanted to own my work of my first six albums when I changed record labels.

""My first six albums were actually sold away from me and so I decided, I just figured if I made them the first time I can make them again.""

Top 10 best-selling vinyl albums 2023

The BPI said cassette sales were also picking up again after dying out in early 1990s, while the decline in CD sales had begun to slowdown, ""plateauing"" at most 11 million units in 2023.

Take That's This Life is the year's top selling CD, while Olivia Rodrigo's Guts was the best performing cassette.

Back in 1990, …But Seriously by Phil Collins was the best-selling album followed by The Immaculate Collection by Madonna.

A live album by the three tenors - José Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti - was the third biggest album followed by The Very Best of Elton John then Soul Provider by Michael Bolton.

Commenting on this year, BPI boss Dr Jo Twist said: ""Led by vinyl, the resurgence of physical product underlines the resilience of the UK music market at a time when streaming consumption continues to hit record levels.","UK vinyl sales at the highest level since 1990By Daniel Thomas Business reporterGetty ImagesTaylor Swift has three albums in the UK's best selling vinyl this yearUK sales of vinyl LPs have hit their highest level since 1990 as the revival of the physical music market continues.

Watch: Dramatic videos from Prague as people are seen leaping from building ledge

The gunman who killed 14 people at a university in Prague confessed to an earlier double murder in his suicide note, Czech police have said.

The note found in David Kozak's home contained a confession he had shot dead a man and his baby daughter in woods near the city on 15 December, six days before the Charles University attack.

Police said he had been on a list of 4,000 suspects for their murders.

Kozak also killed his father, bringing the total number of his victims to 17.

The attack at the university on 21 December is the worst mass shooting in Czech history.

Kozak, a 24-year-old masters history student at the university, killed himself after being surrounded by armed police.

As first reported in the newspaper Denik N, the note was discovered by police in Kozak's home on 21 December - the same day as the attack.

It contained a confession he had shot dead the pair in Klanovice woods on the eastern outskirts of the capital a week previously.

The victims are reported to be a 32-year-old man and a two-month-old girl, according to Czech media.

Detectives had said it was ""highly probable"" that the gunman had also carried out the Klanovice killings. This was later confirmed by ballistics.

They said Kozak had been on a long list of potential suspects whom they wanted to interview and expressed regret they had been unable to get to him earlier.

A vigil last Saturday outside the university

Last week's attack at the university centred on the Faculty of Arts building on Jan Palach Square, where Kozak was seen opening fire with a rifle from the rooftop.

University staff and students were told to barricade themselves in during the attack.

Thirteen people died at the university, while a fourteenth victim died from their injuries in hospital. A further 25 people were wounded, police said.

Police have not released the possible motive for the killings, saying the investigation is ongoing.

Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan has called on the mayors of all towns and villages to cancel New Year's fireworks displays in light of the massacre.

On social media, he called on all Czechs to mark the event in a peaceful fashion, saying it was the least the nation could do for those traumatised by the killings.

The attack at the university had one of the largest death tolls of any mass shooting by a lone gunman in Europe this century:

By Tom Gerken Technology reporter

US news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

The lawsuit, which also names Microsoft as a defendant, says the firms should be held responsible for ""billions of dollars"" in damages.

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) ""learn"" by analysing a massive amount of data often sourced online.

The BBC has approached OpenAI and Microsoft for comment.

The lawsuit claims ""millions"" of articles published by the New York Times were used without its permission to make ChatGPT smarter, and claims the tool is now competing with the newspaper as a trustworthy information source.

It alleges that when asked about current events, ChatGPT will sometimes generate ""verbatim excerpts"" from New York Times articles, which cannot be accessed without paying for a subscription.

According to the lawsuit, this means readers can get New York Times content without paying for it - meaning it is losing out on subscription revenue as well as advertising clicks from people visiting the website.

It also gave the example of the Bing search engine - which has some features powered by ChatGPT - producing results taken from a New York Times-owned website, without linking to the article or including referral links it uses to generate income.

Watch: Expert: AI ‘hurts ability to keep democracy alive’

Microsoft has invested more than $10 billion (£7.8 billion) in OpenAI.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court, reveals the New York Times unsuccessfully approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to seek ""an amicable resolution"" over its copyright.

Multiple lawsuits

It comes a month after a period of chaos at OpenAI where co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was sacked - and then rehired - over the course of a few days.

His sacking shocked industry insiders and led to staff threatening mass resignations unless he was reinstated.

But as well as the internal issues, the firm is now facing multiple lawsuits filed in 2023.

In September a similar copyright infringement case was brought by a group of US authors including Game of Thrones novelist George RR Martin and John Grisham.

That followed legal action brought by comedian Sarah Silverman in July, as well as an open letter signed by authors Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman that same month calling for AI companies to compensate them for using their work.

And OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit alongside Microsoft - and programming site GitHub - from a group of computing experts who argue their code was used without their permission to train an AI called Copilot.

As well as these actions, there have been many cases brought against developers of so-called generative AI - that is, artificial intelligence that can create media based on text prompts - with artists suing text-to-image generators Stability AI and Midjourney in January, claiming they only function by being trained on copyrighted artwork.","New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI for ‘billions’By Tom Gerken Technology reporterGetty ImagesUS news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

Nastya Ivleeva and Philipp Kirkorov were pictured during the party

This is Partygate: Russia-style.

What happened at a Moscow nightclub was bizarre. What happened next says so much about the current atmosphere in Russia.

On 20 December, blogger and TV presenter Nastya Ivleeva threw an ""Almost Naked Party"" at Moscow's Mutabor nightclub.

Dress code? More like an undress code.

Scantily clad pop stars and celebrities attended the soiree. Including Russian rapper Vacio [real name Nikolai Vasiliev]. He turned up wearing only training shoes and one strategically placed sock.

It was a private party. But it became very public when videos and photos appeared on social media. Overnight, Vacio's became the most famous sock in Russia. And not in a good way.

There was uproar. Pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who support the war in Ukraine, were furious: how could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the ""special military operation""?

For the revellers, the party was well and truly over. Rapper Vacio was arrested and jailed for 15 days for ""disorderly conduct"". He was also fined 200,000 roubles (£1,700; $2,200) for ""promoting non-traditional sexual relations"".

The organiser of the ""Almost Naked Party"", Nastya Ivleeva, is facing legal action. More than 20 people have signed a class-action lawsuit. They're demanding she pay a billion roubles (£8.5m) to the Defender of the Fatherland Foundation, an organisation that donates money to participants of the Kremlin's ""special operation"".

Other partygoers are facing the music, too.

Russian Eurovision veteran Dima Bilan insisted he was fully clothed and had no idea what other guests would wear

There's talk of concert dates being cancelled and advertising contracts terminated. Reports, too, that some of the stars are being edited out of pre-recorded New Year's Eve entertainment shows on Russian TV.

Big names - suddenly cancelled.

Cue the video messages.

One by one, the prominent party guests have been taking to social media - some to apologise for their attendance, others to insist they've done nothing wrong.

""I recognise I made a mistake,"" declared the now fully dressed megastar Philipp Kirkorov. ""The last thing I want is for such an event, my mistake, to result in restrictions on my career in Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen.""

""I wore a polo-neck, a big trench coat, trousers and shoes,"" said pop star Dima Bilan. ""I couldn't know in advance what the other guests would be wearing.""

Stephane Cardinale/Corbis

Until now, Philipp Kirkorov has been a staple of Russia's pre-recorded New Year's Eve TV schedule

""Тhey say that Russia knows how to forgive. If so, I would like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,"" said Nastya Ivleeva in her video message.

""If the answer is no, then I'm ready for my public execution. I won't shy away. I'm ready for any outcome.""

Events of the last few days will have come as a shock to these celebrities.

Following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they had taken the conscious decision to remain in Russia and continue their careers, and often lavish lifestyles, here. Public criticism was reserved for those anti-war celebs who had left Russia.

Not any more. But why?

It seems to me that Russia's political system, increasingly, relies on scapegoats. It needs groups or individuals it can point to and blame for problems at home and abroad.

Up till now, those scapegoats have included Ukraine, the US, the UK, the EU and Nato.

Now, it seems, some Russian celebrities are on the list.

In a social media post, this is how exiled Russian opposition activist Maxim Katz summed up events: ""In the past, there was a simple social contract with people who went to parties like this: do whatever you want as long as you stay loyal.

""But life is no party now. These ostentatious displays contrast with reality outside. You can't flippantly party in a country waging war.","Russian celebs at 'almost naked' party stung by backlashBy Steve Rosenberg Russia EditorInstagram/_AGENTGIRL_Nastya Ivleeva and Philipp Kirkorov were pictured during the partyThis is Partygate: Russia-style.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee Blanchard

A woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard, 32, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Dee Dee Blanchard in Missouri in 2015.

She plotted with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother following years of abuse.

He stabbed Dee Dee Blanchard to death with a knife her daughter gave him and the pair fled the scene.

They were then arrested hundreds of miles away in Wisconsin where Godejohn lived. He is serving a life sentence without parole.

The case sparked intense media interest and spawned a number of documentary series and TV shows.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard walked out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri at 03:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Thursday having served seven years of a 10-year sentence.

While in prison, she gave a number of interviews detailing her mother's abusive behaviour and a memoir she wrote while behind bars is due to be published in January.

In a recent interview with People Magazine she said: ""Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.""

Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly abused her daughter for years by convincing her that she was disabled and required medical support.

She told people that Blanchard had multiple conditions including epilepsy, vision impairments and muscular dystrophy.

She received support from charities and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, often portraying her daughter as younger than she actually was and subjecting her to unneeded medical treatments.

Blanchard used a wheelchair, feeding tube and an oxygen tank even though she could walk and had no health issues.

She later said her mother kept her weak and isolated. Blanchard soon became more interested in the outside world, making a dating profile and meeting Godejohn.

""I wanted to be free of her hold on me,"" she said during Godejohn's trial. ""I talked him into it.""

She reached a plea deal with prosecutors due to the abuse she had suffered, which meant a 10-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty.","Gypsy Rose Blanchard released early from US prisonBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsBlanchard familyGypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee BlanchardA woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Cher has filed for a conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman due to his alleged substance abuse and mental health issues.

Court documents seen by the BBC claim Mr Allman, 47, is ""substantially unable to manage his financial resources"".

In the documents, lawyers for Cher say a conservator is ""urgently needed"" to protect his property and physical and mental health.

Cher's publicist has been approached for comment.

Mr Allman has not commented publicly on the legal filing. He recently posted the hashtag ""#imprisonmentviaconservatorship"" on an Instagram post.

A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.

It can be used to manage a person's financial affairs or personal affairs or both.

Mr Allman is due to receive assets from a trust before the end of the year.

The documents state he is entitled to regular payments from the trust set up by his late father, musician Gregg Allman.

The court papers, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, state Mr Allman is ""currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues"".

The filing adds: ""Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, [Cher] is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk.""

It says that Cher, 77, has ""worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs"".

A hearing for a temporary order is currently set for 5 January, with the hearing on a permanent order scheduled for 6 March.

Cher recently denied allegations that she hired four men to kidnap Mr Allman from a New York City hotel room.

The singer told People Magazine ""that rumour is not true"".

Cher was married to Greg Allman from 1975 to 1979. She was previously married to her former singing partner Sonny Bono from 1964 to 1975. She also has a child, Chaz Bono, from that relationship.

The fish can grow to four metres in length and weigh 200kg or more

Guillermo Otta Parum has been fishing in the Bolivian Amazon his whole life, for more than 50 years.

At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

But then a giant freshwater fish arrived, known locally as paiche or Arapaima gigas, to give it its scientific name.

""I thought this creature was a water snake, that it would attack everything, that eating it would be bad for you, that it might be poisonous,"" he recalls.

In fact, it is one of the biggest freshwater fishes in the world, growing up to 4m in length and weighing 200kg (440lb) or more.

Guillermo Otta Parum has been a fisherman for 50 years

It is estimated that every year, the paiche spreads another 40km deeper into the rivers of the Amazon basin.

Federico Moreno, director of the Beni Autonomous University's Centre for Aquatic Resources Research, says its size and appetite make it a serious threat to native fish stocks.

""It is a territorial fish, it takes over a body of water and scares off the native species. [That] is one of the serious problems. The other species flee from the predator and enter other bodies of water much further away, more remote and difficult to access.""

No one really knows the exact year that the paiche first appeared in Bolivia.

It is generally believed its arrival was the result of a breach of a paiche fish farm in Peru, where the fish are native. From there, they spread into Bolivia's rivers.

Biologist Fernando Carvajal has spent years studying the Paiche

Fernando Carvajal is a biologist and expert on the paiche. He says they are a ravenous species.

""During the first years of life, the paiche grows at the rate of 10kg a year. That means the paiche is eating a lot of fish.""

Unlike other predatory fish like piranha, it only has small, not particularly sharp teeth.

But its lack of impressive teeth does not stop it from eating piranha and a host of other fish, along with plants, molluscs and birds, all of which it hoovers up like a giant vacuum cleaner.

It also frightens off any fish which tries to eat the paiche's young.

Fernando Carvajal says there is no firm data about the impact of the paiche, but he says that anecdotally, fishermen are reporting that the numbers of some native species are dwindling.

""In the next one or two decades, the paiche is going to spread to all the potential areas where this species can live,"" he warns.

""We know that around the world, most invasive cases are bad for nature. Invasive species are considered the second-biggest reason for the loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction.""

However, for local fishermen, the arrival of the paiche has been a boon. Having been initially afraid of it, it did not take long for fishermen to realize its potential, says Guillermo Otta Parum.

Paiche fishing boat on the Yata River in the Bolivian Amazon

""When I brought the first fish, I would give the customers small pieces as a gift for them to try so they would get a taste for it.""

Some fishermen even pretended it was a type of catfish to overcome people's suspicions about eating such a huge specimen.

Now paiche are eaten across Bolivia.

Edson Suzano runs a paiche-processing plant in Riberalta, a town in north-east Bolivia close to the Brazilian border.

Edson Suzano (left) says the paiche is affordable

""We sell it everywhere - supermarkets, markets. There are different cuts, so it is affordable. We buy and process around 30,000kg per month,"" he says.

The challenge for the fishermen is trying to find the paiche in the huge expanse of the Amazon.

The fish has a lung-like organ and has to come up for air regularly to breathe and so likes calmer water. It prefers to live in lakes and lagoons, but migrates when it feels it is in danger.

The paiche migrates when it feels it is in danger

Most of the fish Edson Silvano processes used to arrive by boat.

Now the fishermen travel to ever more remote areas to catch the paiche and have to transfer from boats to canoes, on journeys of up to two weeks. This is putting them in conflict with indigenous communities.

These communities have been given land titles to many of the remote lagoons where paiche are now to be found and have themselves started fishing for and selling the fish.

Paiche being prepared for sale at Riberalta's fish market

Now commercial fishermen have to obtain special licences to work in these areas. But fishermen like Guillermo Otta Parum say that even when they have the correct paperwork, they are often turned away.

The indigenous communities argue that they are only trying to protect the resources which the Bolivian government has recognised they have a right to control.

Juan Carlos Ortiz Chavez is a paiche fisherman who belongs to the Alto Ivon Tco Chacobo indigenous community:

He says that in the past, indigenous people were scared of commercial fishermen. ""But this new generation of young people has changed, because we have made our rules so that people can't come and take from us any more,"" he explains.

Scientists such as Federico Moreno hope that fishing generally, whoever is doing it, will keep paiche numbers in check.

""Keep hunting them, keep fishing for them all the time and that could keep a balance between the different species.""","At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

Christianne Ireland

Christianne's father - Innes Ireland - won the Grand Prix when she was three years old in 1961

The daughter of a Formula 1 legend has described how she went from jet setting to homelessness before turning her life around.

Christianne Ireland grew up following her father Innes Ireland around race tracks, spending her days with champions like Stirling Moss and Graham Hill.

But in 2016 she said she found herself homeless and addicted to alcohol.

She credits volunteering at a small allotment with saving her life.

Recalling the first years of her life with her father, she said it was like ""living in a circus"".

""Obviously Stirling was his greatest friend. Frank Williams would pop round and it would be we're going over to Stirling's for supper and I'd be put in the car and off we'd go,"" she said.

""Everybody's door was open, unlike Formula 1 now.""

But after years of owning cars like Aston Martins and travelling the world, she ended up with just one suitcase outside a homeless shelter in Andover, Hampshire.

""It was like falling out of an ivory tower,"" she said.

Christianne said volunteering in a small allotment saved her life

At the time she was 58 years old, had faced two divorces, was addicted to alcohol and had no choice but to move from her former home in Berkshire.

""From eight in the morning I would have to be out of the hostel. I wasn't streetwise. I didn't know anyone there,"" she said.

""The main part of my day was making sure I didn't go and have a drink because once that started all hell would be let lose.""

As part of her recovery from alcoholism, Christianne was encouraged to volunteer for Hampshire charity Unity. She began helping out at a small allotment in Andover.

""On the days it was really bad and I wanted to go out and pick up a drink all I had to do was put one foot in front of the other and get to the allotment,"" she explained.

Christianne Ireland

Christianne and her parents lived a jet set lifestyle

The allotment soon gave her a glimmer of hope and after a few months she managed to find a job and rent a flat.

Now the 65-year-old works as a support manager for Unity and helps oversee a food pantry project.

""I grew with the allotment,"" she said.

Arriving in Andover was one of the toughest periods in Christianne's life. But she also believes losing everything made her a better person.

""In a way I look at it on hindsight as a snake shedding its skin and I then found me,"" she said.

Christianne is encouraging other people to consider volunteering as a New Year's resolution.

""It's never too late to make a change. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and things will happen,"" she added.

By Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, Sweden

Modvion

Engineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine tower

What is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

If that calls to mind flat-pack furniture and meatballs, you're wrong.

If you answered ""a wooden wind turbine"", you could be a visionary.

According to Modvion, the Swedish start-up that has just built the world's tallest wooden turbine tower, using wood for wind power is the future.

""It's got great potential,"" Otto Lundman, the company's chief executive, says as we gaze upwards at the firm's brand new turbine, a short drive outside Gothenburg.

It's 150m (492ft) to the tip of the highest blade and we are the first journalists to be invited to have a look inside. The 2 megawatt generator on top has just started supplying electricity to the Swedish grid, providing power for about 400 homes.

The dream of Lundman and Modvion is to take the wood and wind much higher.

Steel limitations

On the horizon near the Modvion project, several very similar-looking turbines are turning.

Steel, not wood, is the key material for them, as it is for almost all of the world's turbine towers. Strong and durable, steel has enabled huge turbines and wind farms to be constructed on land and at sea.

Modvion

The blades and generator from this 150m wind turbine in Skara, Sweden, are made of conventional materials

But steel is not without its limitations, particularly for projects on land.

As demand has grown for taller turbines that harvest stronger winds with larger generators, the diameter of the cylindrical steel towers to support them has had to grow too.

In a world of road tunnels, bridges and roundabouts, many in the wind industry say getting those huge pieces of metal to turbine sites has become a real headache, in effect limiting how tall new steel turbines can be.

Wooden turbine or sauna?

From the outside, there is little obvious difference between the Modvion wooden turbine and its steel cousins.

Both have a thick white coating to protect them from the elements and blades made primarily from fibreglass attached to a generator, which produces electricity when it turns.

It is only when we go inside the tower that the differences becomes clear. The walls have a curved raw wood finish, not unlike a sauna.

Kevin Church/BBC

Otto Lundman of Modvion shows Jonah the interior of the wooden turbine

The 105m (345ft) tower's strength comes from the 144 layers of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) that make its thick walls.

By varying the grain of each of the 3mm-thick layers of spruce, Modvion says it has been able to control the wall's strength and flexibility. ""It's our secret recipe,"" says company co-founder - and former architect and boat builder - David Olivegren, with a smile.

At the factory, on the edge of Gothenburg, the thin layers of wood have been glued and compressed together to make the curved sections. Those pieces are then taken on site, glued together into cylinders and then stacked on top of each other to make the tower.

""Wood and glue is the perfect combination, we've known that for hundreds of years,"" Olivegren says. ""And because using wood is lighter [than steel] you can build taller turbines with less material.""

David Olivegren of Modvion inspects a modular section of the wooden turbine tower in the factory

Lundman and Olivegren tell me their turbine's big selling point is that, by using wood and glue, towers can be built in smaller, more easily transported modules.

That will make it much easier to build really tall towers, they say, and to take the pieces to challenging locations.

However, Dr Maximilian Schnippering, head of sustainability at Siemens Gamesa - one of the worlds largest turbine manufacturers - says more pieces are likely to mean more trucks, more people and more time to complete the installation. He considers the modular system ""an advantage"" and that wooden towers can ""nicely complement"" steel towers.

Siemens Gamesa's efforts are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the steel it uses, he says.

Inside the Modvion tower, I am shown how the wooden modules have been stacked on top of each other and how they are held by steel fittings that are then glued into place.

""The industry wants to build turbines with a 300m [blade] tip height, which means a tower which is 200m or more in height. With modularity you can do that,"" says Lundman.

The wooden parts of the turbine tower are glued together on site

Steel could of course be modular too, with the cylinders cut up into smaller pieces, but the extra effort needed to then bolt the pieces together adds both to costs and to maintenance.

One of the investors in Modvion is renewable energy giant Vestas. It has installed more wind power capacity around the world than any other.

Jan Hagen, its chief technology officer for northern and central Europe, tells me they see ""tremendous potential"" in the market for taller turbines, with wooden turbines ""particularly well suited"" to play a role.

""What we find interesting about this is that its combination of an economically viable solution that addresses the transport bottleneck and a sustainable solution,"" Hagen says.

Negative carbon footprint

Though wind power is cheaper and cleaner than almost all other forms of electricity generation, making steel involves extremely hot furnaces and almost always the burning of fossil fuels. That means CO2 emissions - the main driver of climate change.

Modvion says using wood instead of steel eliminates the wind turbines' carbon footprint entirely, making them carbon negative.

That's because the trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere when they are alive and, when they are chopped down, the carbon is stored in the wood. As long as the wood doesn't end up rotting or being burned, the carbon is not released.

About 200 trees went into Modvion's turbine tower. They were the same species - spruce - that is used for Christmas trees and the company says they are farmed sustainably, meaning when they are harvested more are planted.

SSE Renewables, one of the UK's largest producers of wind power, told the BBC it was aware of Modvion's work and that it would be looking into wooden towers as ""an alternative technology"" to steel. However, many of SSE's projects are offshore, which can be reached using huge ships - meaning the modular transport benefits are less pronounced.

Modvion says it is hoping to build another even taller turbine soon and, if all goes well, it will open a facility that will produce 100 wooden modular turbines a year in 2027.

""The industry is currently putting up 20,000 turbines a year,"" Lundman says. ""Our ambition is that in 10 years time 10% of those turbines - about 2000 - will be wooden.""","World's tallest wooden wind turbine starts turningBy Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, SwedenModvionEngineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine towerWhat is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Taiwan

Campaigning is in full swing for Taiwan's presidential election on 13 January

The December sun is baking on the Heng Chun peninsula, the tongue of land that juts out from the bottom end of Taiwan into the Philippine Sea.

A half-smoked cigarette pokes from the corner of Hsu Keng-Jui's mouth. He is part of a network of volunteers - most of them veterans like him - who track the now-constant presence of Chinese ships and aircraft just outside Taiwan's territorial limit.

Using plastic zip ties, Mr Hsu straps a long radio antenna to a steel railing, then sits down with his portable radios and begins to scan the military channels. At first all we hear is the soft southern lilt of the Taiwan coastguard directing sea traffic. Then a different accent and a different tone comes through the heavy static. It's the Chinese navy.

China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province. With just weeks to go, Beijing looms larger than ever before - on the ballot, and at Taiwan's borders.

""We represent all the people of China,"" the voice from the Chinese navy intones. ""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""

Dragging on another cigarette, Mr Hsu looks unmoved: ""I hear it every day now. It's like they're reading from a script.""

Another voice comes across the airwaves. It's the captain of a Chinese tugboat, just three miles off Taiwan's coast.

The captain has been asked to move out of Taiwan's territorial waters, but he refuses: ""What territorial waters are you talking about? Taiwan doesn't have any territorial waters!""

Mr Hsu is suddenly furious. He leaps up, grabs a handset and lets loose a stream of invective over the airwaves. He swears as he sits back down, muttering, ""Who does he think he is?""

Hsu Keng-Jui is a veteran who volunteers to track Chinese military intrusion into Taiwan's territory

For decades the governments in Beijing and Taipei had an unwritten agreement not to stray across a median line that divides the 110-mile-wide strait between them.

Now China is crossing it almost daily, at sea and in the air.

On one day in September the People's Liberation Army sent more than a 100 aircraft towards Taiwan, 40 of which crossed the median line.

This so-called ""grey zone warfare"" is meant to ""subdue the enemy without fighting"" to borrow the words of a legendary Chinese military strategist. In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.

""China is sending a very strong message to the United States and even Japan,"" says retired Admiral Lee Hsi-min, a former commander of Taiwan's armed forces. ""It's telling them that Taiwan is part of China. That this is our area so we can do whatever we want here. Meanwhile it's aimed at making Taiwanese people scared and making them capitulate.""

With Taiwan due to elect a new president on 13 January, the key objective is to undermine support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The island's current president Tsai Ing-wen is stepping down after eight years in power.

Beijing on the ballot - again

President Tsai, who has been candid yet deft in her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty, is deeply disliked by Beijing. But the man running to replace her, current vice-president William Lai, is far worse in their eyes. Despite saying he will do nothing to change the status quo, Mr Lai is seen by China as a hardline ""splittist"", an advocate of formal Taiwan independence.

Beijing's message to voters in Taiwan is that a vote for William Lai is a vote for war. It's also the message from the main opposition party, the nationalist Kuomintang or KMT. Their candidate Hou Yu-ih told supporters at a recent rally: ""Our whole generation will lose everything we have fought for during our lifetime [if Lai wins].""

But DPP supporters don't seem cowed. They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.

On a recent drizzly Sunday afternoon, around 60,000 DPP supporters crowded into a square in downtown Taipei to see Mr Lai and his running mate speak.

Then President Tsai stepped onto stage and the crowd came alive cheering and waving little, green DPP flags. Dotted among them were many rainbow flags of gay pride. Ms Tsai is adored by the LGBT community here for making Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.

Democratic elections aside, this is yet another thing that sets Taiwan apart from China. And it is one of many reasons DPP supporters are adamant this island will never be part of the People's Republic of China.

""I am very worried [about the threats from China], but I am not afraid,"" said Frederika Chou. ""Because I will volunteer to be a soldier and fight if they ever try to invade our beautiful country.""

""Some day we may have war, but I'm not afraid because I am Taiwanese, and I need to protect my country,"" said 27-year-old Abby Ding who'd come to the rally with her father all the way from Tainan in the south.

Beijing is far from the only issue on the ballot. Rising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate Ko Wen-je.

Once a DPP supporter, Mr Ko now positions himself as a middle-of-the road option between his main rivals - and one who can broker better ties with Beijing. While ""reunification"" was always a possibility, China's claims have now turned more urgent, especially with its leader Xi Jinping's repeated vows to take the island, with a deadline to boot.

The issue of how much Taiwan should prepare to fight divides the island's main parties. The current DPP government has invested heavily in new, domestically-built submarines and bought scores more F16 fighter jets and modern missiles from the US. It has reinstated 12-month-long compulsory military service and says it will do more if re-elected.

Supporters at a recent rally for KMT, which is campaigning on a promise to secure peace with Beijing

The KMT is much more ambivalent. Its candidate for vice-president, Jaw Shaw Kong, has labelled the submarine building programme a vanity project and a huge waste of money. Mr Jaw's family is from China, and he has long been seen as one of the most Beijing-friendly voices in Taiwan politics.

He says the only way to secure peace for Taiwan is to talk to Beijing, to reassure Mr Xi that Taiwan is not intent on independence, and that one day Taiwan and China can and should be united.

This is far from an unpopular opinion in Taiwan. The island's links to China, from family ties to trade, run deep and are tangled with complicated questions about the past and identity. It's an issue that often pits an older generation with stronger ties to the mainland, against young people who have grown up in a democratic, open society.

No-one will deny the military threat from China but they are divided over how best to deter it.

While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure.

Early one morning in December a group of Mirage 2000 fighter jets scrambled from their base on the west coast and roared out in to the Taiwan straits. The base is home to the 45 jets of Taiwan's rapid reaction squadron, tasked with confronting those Chinese aircraft daily probing the edge of Taiwan's airspace.

The jets were bought from France in the early 1990s and are now getting old. China is wearing down the Taiwanese air force, says retired admiral Lee. And they can feel the impact because maintenance has increased and ""it is actually affecting our capability"", he adds.

China can afford to fly as often as it likes. The People's Liberation Army has more than 2,000 fighter jets and is building many more. Taiwan has fewer than 300, many of them now over a quarter of a century old.

Military experts say that the wear and tear on the Mirage fleet is so high and the cost of fixing them so prohibitive that they've quietly stopped scrambling to intercept all but the most threatening of Chinese intrusions.

Taiwan's Mirage 2000 fighter jets are old - and they are being exhausted by Chinese incursions

The long game

The latest polling data suggest Mr Lai and the DPP are heading for victory in January albeit by a small margin. For the DPP it would be an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term, and a slap in the face for Beijing.

But the DPP will probably get less than 40% of the vote. That means there is still plenty to play for. Taiwan has a free press and an open internet. So the door is wide open for China's propaganda apparatus to target the 60% of voters who won't vote for the DPP. They will also be voting in a new legislature, which the KMT could win.

For years the main target of Chinese propaganda has been Taiwan's older population, particularly those with family ties to the mainland, people who have traditionally voted for the KMT.

""It's been very effective,"" says Puma Shen, an academic and political activist who has spent years studying Chinese influence operations around the world.

""If you look back in history, supporters of the KMT used to be very anti-Chinese Communist Party. But now they have become anti-Taiwan independence. They now believe people who support Taiwan independence are the ones who could trigger a war.""

A group of voters who used to think of the Chinese Communist Party as the enemy, now think the DPP is the real danger. It's not a rare view in Taiwan. Older Taipei residents speak disparagingly of President Tsai and her party as a ""bunch of troublemakers"".

But Beijing knows the key to success will be winning over young voters, those who have no party affiliation and are dissatisfied with both the old traditional parties. They are now being targeted through TikTok and YouTube. China has over 200 channels that are uploading videos daily.

""They are very good at finding out what young Taiwanese are interested in and then creating content to attract them,"" Mr Shen says. It's what he calls ""paving the road"". Once an audience is established and trust develops, pro-China messaging is then introduced.

Mr Shen's research has shown an increase in groups of young Taiwanese who are not pro-China, but have become increasingly anti-US and anti-Japan. Such influence operations are unlikely to yield any sudden embrace of China. But Beijing is playing the long game.","China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province.
""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""
In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.
They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.
While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure."

By Sue Mitchell & Ben Milne BBC News

Carolyn Stephens

When her elderly father found a new partner, Carolyn Stephens was stopped from seeing him, and then left helpless as he vanished from her life.

In 2012, Carolyn waved goodbye to her 78-year-old widowed father as he headed off to Cyprus on a package holiday for older people.

Vincent Stephens was comfortably retired after a successful career as an electrical engineer.

On his return, he introduced Carolyn to Iris, a 75-year-old woman with whom he had struck up a friendship on holiday.

Carolyn, his only child, quickly became worried by this new relationship.

Vincent sold his house in 2014, in the Suffolk village where he had lived since retirement, and bought a new home 30 miles away in Norfolk, to be close to Iris.

Carolyn suspected that Iris was trying to separate him from his family, as well as the friendship network he had built up over the years in Suffolk.

""It was actually really distressing for my dad,"" she says. ""I remember one conversation where she was shouting at him that he didn't love me. And he was saying yeah, of course I do. She's my daughter - of course I love her.""

Vincent told his daughter he could not work out why she and Iris did not get on.

His brother-in-law, Brian, says Vincent seemed happy with Iris when they were first together, but that he became more concerned as he saw how Carolyn was being pushed out of Vincent's life: ""He loved his daughter so much, so how he felt when they lost touch I don't know, but I saw how concerned Carolyn was about it.""

Vincent's sister-in-law, Sheila, also had misgivings about Iris: ""She wasn't over-friendly, and I don't know whether she thought [Vincent's family] were competition,"" she says, ""but she seemed very jealous of Carolyn's relationship with her dad.""

Carolyn was also worried that her father's mental state was deteriorating, and that he was showing early signs of dementia.

""Dad got more fragile. He was forgetting to get his car insured, he was missing appointments.""

In 2018, Carolyn accompanied Vincent to an appointment with his GP, who assessed him for possible cognitive decline. The test was inconclusive, but there were causes for concern, and the doctor recommended further investigation.

But Vincent did not turn up for a second appointment, and subsequent follow-ups were cancelled. Dr James Warner, a specialist in the field, says this is a common problem.

""Most people with dementia do not know that they've got dementia,"" he says, ""And so, they're not going to… go to the GP and say, something's wrong.""

Meanwhile, a quick succession of events was causing mounting alarm for Carolyn.

Within a day of his missed appointment, Vincent had moved in with Iris, and then, a few weeks later, she had taken him to a register office to be married.

However, the ceremony did not take place because the registrar was so worried about Vincent's mental state.

""He couldn't answer even basic questions about his own address, his bride's date of birth, where or when he was supposed to be married,"" says Carolyn.

Even so, that same week, Carolyn learned that Iris had won power of attorney over Vincent's affairs. She now had the legal right to act on his behalf in both financial and property, and health and welfare affairs.

Anyone giving away power of attorney must have enough mental capacity to understand the consequences of what they're doing, and must not be coerced into signing. But the system is open to abuse, says Dr Warner.

Finding My Father

The remarkable story of how an elderly former engineer in his 80s was taken from his family and kept hidden for four years, and the long search by his devoted daughter to track him down.

Broadcast 13:30 GMT, 31 December on BBC Radio 4 - or listen on BBC Sounds

""I've had a case where I've been asked to assess someone's capacity to sign a lasting power of attorney for property and finance. My conclusion was that they did not have mental capacity. And the family said, 'oh, don't worry, we'll get someone else to sign it'.""

Within days, Vincent's house was put up for sale. But, worse was to come - something Carolyn had never anticipated.

Iris complained to the police that Carolyn was harassing Vincent, and that he wanted nothing further to do with his daughter.

""The police [told] me that I couldn't contact my dad again, because I was abusing him,"" says Carolyn. ""I called back and said, could you tell me exactly what I'm supposed to have done? And they couldn't.""

Carolyn was concerned for her father's welfare, but the call from the police - and the threat of further action - made her very worried about calling him.

In early 2019, she had an email from her father, saying that he had been hospitalised following a fall. Neither Carolyn nor any of her family members had been told about the accident.

During a visit to Vincent in hospital, she witnessed Iris telling him that he had to choose between his family or her.

Carolyn Stephens

Carolyn was told soon after that - despite being diagnosed with dementia while in hospital - her father had signed a GDPR form, preventing any information from being shared with his daughter. A few months later, she was told that his house had been sold, and emptied of his possessions.

Over the next few years, Carolyn's family and friends tried calling Vincent at Iris's house. They were told variously that he was out, asleep or did not want to talk - and then the phone was usually put down on them.

""We were sending birthday cards, Christmas cards, in the hope that they would reach him,"" says Carolyn. ""And we learned later that none of those cards had ever reached him. He had no idea that people were still trying to get hold of him.""

Carolyn did not see or hear from her father for almost four years. For some of that time, she did not know if he was even alive.

In May 2022, Carolyn discovered that Iris had died. Family members tried contacting Iris's family to find out where Vincent was, but without success.

When the registrar confirmed Iris's death to Carolyn, she saw that her father was no longer listed as living at her address. But where was he?

Sheila called Iris's home again and was told by a man that ""he could not help her"" - before putting the phone down.

The family alerted the UK National Missing Persons Unit, and Carolyn started her own search for Vincent.

Every three months she would check the newly released national register of deaths, which is updated every three months, hoping against hope not to spot her father's name there.

""It was harrowing,"" she says, ""but I had to keep looking. I needed to know whether Dad had died. I needed to know because at least that would have given me some closure.""

Carolyn also started looking through the electoral register. She could not find his details anywhere on the online version, so she turned to the more detailed full register, which is held on paper at the British Library in London.

Carolyn and her husband began combing through the names and addresses of everyone in Norfolk - the county where Vincent was last known to have been living. With a voting population of 700,000 in 2022, this was no easy task.

Emma Lynch/BBC

Carolyn Stephens at the British Library, where she searched the electoral register for her father's details

For almost a week, they checked every single page of the records, and then Carolyn finally saw her father's name, ""in a tiny little care home in the middle of nowhere"".

Carolyn says it was one of the happiest moments of her life: ""The librarians had to tell me to be quiet… because I was running around, going, 'I found him, I found him!'""

She discovered that Vincent had been put in a care home just as the Covid lockdown began, in the spring of 2020, and had later been moved on to another. When Carolyn arrived, she saw hardly any personal effects in his room, and staff said he'd had few visitors.

""Only a single painting from his house remained, not a single picture of his family,"" she says. ""Staff at the care home did not know about his love of opera music, they had no idea that he had a daughter, and a huge network of people who loved him and were so worried about him.""

When her father saw her, he waved his arms in the air and shouted ""surprised!"" - it was all he could say. His dementia was so advanced that he couldn't communicate in any other way. But it was enough for Carolyn, who rushed to his bed and hugged him.

""I will never forget it. I was really nervous because I thought he might not recognise me after all that time. But he couldn't stop smiling, he had a huge grin, you know. It was just lovely. It was unbelievable really.""

Carolyn is still trying to piece together what happened in the years between.

In 2012, Vincent had £50,000 in savings and a house worth £250,000. By the time he was found in 2022, he had no home, few possessions and just £83,000 in the bank.

The experience of what happened to her father has led Carolyn to believe that better legal protections are needed for vulnerable older people.

Carolyn says that if her father had been able to cast forward and plan for what might happen to him, an early diagnosis of his dementia, and maybe an early power of attorney in her favour to protect him, it would have been more difficult to shut out her and her family.

She is also worried that the new Powers of Attorney Act, aimed at streamlining the process in England and Wales, may make older people more vulnerable: ""It's similar to changing a will or getting married… and actually, it's even more powerful.""

Vincent died in June this year, six months after he was reunited with his daughter.

Carolyn Stephens

Vincent Stephens died in June 2023

""We were able to have a really simple memorial in the same place where Mum is buried,"" says Carolyn. ""And it almost seemed like nothing had happened - that these last five years were gone.""

She says that people ask her how she kept going through that time. She says it was because Vincent was her father. ""I was not going to let him die thinking that I had stopped wanting to see him and care about him. He looked after me all my life, and I just never ever wanted him to think that I'd abandoned him.""

The BBC has approached Iris's family for comment, but has received no reply.

By James Waterhouse BBC Ukraine correspondent

Satellite images showed the landing ship Novocherkassk docked at Feodosiya first on 5 December (L), then on 26 December

It was an explosion which filled the sky and lifted Ukrainian morale.

For Kyiv, the sight of Russia's Novocherkassk landing ship being hit in an air strike was a much-needed boost.

With Russia gaining the upper hand in recent weeks and the West's support stuttering, Ukraine has produced another dramatic missile strike in occupied Crimea.

Spectacular? No doubt. But was it significant?

""As a battleship, you might think it's not crucial,"" explains Alina Frolova, who was Ukraine's deputy defence minister between 2019-2020 and is now with the country's Centre for Defence Strategies.

""But we need to look at the full context, it's a step-by-step process.""

Both Ukraine and the UK now say that 20% of Russia's Black Sea Naval Fleet has been destroyed since the start of its full-scale invasion - no mean feat for Ukraine, a country whose navy barely has any ships.

Mostly, Russia's vessels have been destroyed with long-range Storm Shadow missiles supplied by the West.

Watch: Huge explosion as Russian warship hit by missile

That has diminished Russia's ability to launch missile strikes from the sea, and any possibility of it mounting an amphibious attack from the sea is even less likely. It has also unblocked ports like Odesa which has allowed Ukrainian and international cargo ships to travel along an unofficial route.

Frolova thinks this latest strike in Feodosia is a continuation of Ukraine squeezing Russian supply routes to Crimea, and therefore weakening Moscow's grip on the peninsula, which it has held since seizing it in 2014.

""It demonstrates Ukraine's Air Force can operate in the face of Russian air defences,"" she says. ""Ships like this are used to deliver ammunition and drones. Based on the detonation, there were a substantial number of explosives on board.""

Ukraine's Navy claims up to 80 people were on board too.

Land, sea and air

There are four ways Russia supplies Crimea, according to Serhiy Kuzan, co-founder of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre think-tank:

Over the Kerch Bridge, which connects Russia to Crimea

Through the land corridor Russia now occupies on mainland Ukraine

By flying cargo planes from Russia

By water through the Black Sea or Sea of Azov.

Kuzan is confident Russia will have felt this strike. He says because the Kerch Bridge was damaged from previous Ukrainian attacks, Moscow had to look at other means to supply the Crimean peninsula.

Reuters

""Ships allow them to move large loads relatively quickly,"" he says. ""These large ships are intended for carrying up to 500 tonnes of people and equipment.""

The Novocherkassk was one of 12 Russian landing ships, according to Kuzan, of which he says Ukraine has now destroyed half.

Kherson, but bigger

Moscow is currently able to control the front lines in Ukraine. But Kuzan suggests these are not disconnected from Crimea.

""We can't separate the peninsula from the south of Ukraine, namely the occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,"" he says.

As with the liberation of Kherson city last year, Kuzan is optimistic the battles at the front could move in Ukraine's favour if they could eventually lessen Russia's air superiority and frustrate its supply lines to its troops.

This is exactly what led to invading forces retreating across the Dnipro river to the eastern bank in November 2022.

But this time we are talking about a lot more territory. And it is a different story in the east, where Moscow has captured almost all of the town of Mariinka.

Should Ukrainian land forces ever reach Crimean soil, the battle for its liberation would likely be bloody. By carrying out these missile strikes Kyiv is playing the long game by trying to make Russia's presence there untenable.

The problem for President Volodymyr Zelensky is, time is not Ukraine's friend. Some in the West want a faster return for the billions of dollars of aid they have provided so far.","Ukraine war: Does attack on Russian ship make a difference?

By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was made

Donald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The former president made a brief appearance in the 1992 film in a scene filmed at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time.

Director Chris Columbus said Mr Trump insisted on appearing in the film if they used the hotel as a location.

But Mr Trump said the filmmakers were ""begging"" him to appear.

""I was very busy, and didn't want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.

""I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time,"" he said. ""People call me whenever it is aired.""

""If they felt bullied, or didn't want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years?"" Mr Trump added. ""Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that's why!""

The initial comments from Mr Columbus were made in a 2020 interview with Business Insider, although they received renewed attention on social media over Christmas.

The director said Mr Trump sought a cameo appearance in addition to the customary fee to film in the hotel.

The Starship spacecraft's fiery end soon after launch – not once but twice – was a major moment in a year filled with landmark space missions.

""Failure is not an option"" was once the most famous phrase uttered in any of the world's mission control rooms. In 2023, it was ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" – after Elon Musk's new Starship spacecraft exploded. Twice, as it turned out.

Containing the most powerful rocket ever built, Starship is being developed by Musk's company SpaceX. It stands 121m (397ft) high, 9m (29.5ft) wide and has a total of 39 engines. The two-stage launch vehicle is designed to carry some 150 tonnes, or up to 100 people, into space before returning to Earth. SpaceX plans to use Starship to launch multiple satellites at once, Nasa has commissioned a version of the spacecraft to land astronauts on the Moon, and it may one day carry the first settlers to Mars.

""The idea of a fully reusable launch vehicle is hugely ambitious, and on that scale as well, is just tremendous,"" says David Wade, underwriter at the Atrium Space Consortium in London, which insures commercial satellites and launchers.

The first Starship launch from Texas in April lasted four minutes before the rocket exploded, showering debris over the Gulf of Mexico and partially destroying the launch pad. Following thousands of modifications, the second flight in November lasted about eight minutes and – despite another ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" – SpaceX declared the mission a success.

""Quite frankly, they've gone further than I was expecting on the second flight,"" says Wade. ""They are doing incredibly well.""

SpaceX has every reason to be optimistic. When the company was conceived by Musk in the early 2000s it promised to shake-up the rocket business. But the first flight of its Falcon-1 also ended in failure and many people were sceptical of its plans to reuse launchers. Now, 20 years on, some of its rockets have been flown 18 times and SpaceX completely dominates the launcher market and regularly flies astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) in its Dragon spacecraft.

""Ten years ago this place, the Space Coast, was basically dead and, after the Shuttle retired, well over 10,000 people got laid off,"" says Ken Kremer, managing editor of the website Space UpClose, who covers launches from Florida. ""But in the last four or five years, it's started to rebound and aerospace companies are coming back – it's really a boomtown here right now and that's almost all due to SpaceX.""

It's going to take a tremendous amount of work, it's incredibly complicated – Ken Kremer

Today, launches from Cape Canaveral are as frequent as one a week. But despite SpaceX's success and ambition, Kremer is sceptical about Nasa's plans to use Starship as a giant lunar lander.

""It's going to take a tremendous amount of work, it's incredibly complicated,"" he says. ""They will have to land upright or the astronauts will die it if it tumbles over – it's going to take about 16 launches before they can land one Starship on the Moon.""

And 51 years after Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan left the last footprint, the Moon is once again the place to be. What is perhaps surprising is that the most ambitious mission in decades was led, not by the traditional space superpowers, but India. On 23 August, Chandrayann-3 made history when it became the first mission to touch down at the lunar south pole.

""It was a globally significant,"" says Mila Mitra, former Nasa scientist and Delhi-based co-founder of education company Stem and Space. ""Landing at the Moon's south pole was much more difficult because it's got more craters, so India has proved that technology, and it was also able to build this mission at a much-reduced cost.""

Live coverage of the landing was laden with patriotism, cutting to India's President Narendra Modi waving the nation's flag as the lander touched down. The mission rover even had the Indian space agency's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels, which left an imprint in the lunar regolith.

The engineers and scientists behind Chandraayn-3 are right to be proud. Despite having only 14 days of power, the rover managed some significant science: finding sulphur, registering a likely moonquake and discovering a temperature difference of around 60C (140F) between the surface and just a few centimetres down.

""This possibly indicates that the topsoil of the Moon may be a very good insulator,"" says Mitra. ""That's promising in terms of finding water underground that might be in the form of ice.""

Confirming the presence of readily available ice would enable future missions to use water for survival and to extract oxygen for air and hydrogen for fuel. It's one of the reasons why the lunar south pole is the destination for Nasa's mission to return humans to the Moon, Artemis III. (Read more about the mysteries of the Moon's south pole.)

Nasa's Osiris-Rex mission could find clues about the origins of life

Unlike the space race of the 1960s, Russia is largely out of the running. Its attempt to beat India to the lunar south pole, Luna 25, crashed into the Moon and its Soyuz spacecraft is a relic from the dawn of the space age. But China is fast catching up with the US. In May, China had six astronauts on board its Tiangong space station (on 30 May, with 11 astronauts on the ISS, there were 17 people in orbit at once – a new record) and it is quietly developing its next generation rockets and spacecraft.

""If [lawmakers] continue to cut Nasa's budget, it is going to delay Project Artemis, it'll delay Starship and the Blue Origin lander too,"" Kremer warns. ""The Chinese could beat us to the Moon, they could beat us to the [lunar] south pole, and that would be really terrible, really terrible.""

But while the race to plant the next flag on the Moon heats-up, some questions in space exploration are so fundamental that they cut through geopolitics. Nasa's Osiris-Rex mission, for example, could find clues about the origins of life. The space probe collected samples of rock from asteroid Bennu and, in September, returned a capsule of material to Earth. Scientists hope the 500m-wide (1,650ft) asteroid will provide new insights into the formation of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago and possibly even how we got here.

Why visit the 'God of Chaos' asteroid? During it's close encounter with the Earth in 2029, the asteroid Apophis will be visible with the naked eye in the Eastern Hemisphere. Nasa's Osiris-Rex spacecraft will then spend 18 months alongside the asteroid – which is named after the Egyptian god of Chaos – so scientists can study how the encounter with Earth has changed it. The spacecraft will repeat a dramatic manoeuvre it performed at Bennu - flying within 5m (16ft) of the asteroid's surface and firing its thrusters downwards to stir up rocks and dust on the surface to give a glimpse of what lies beneath.

In the final days of 2023, Nasa announced it is to redirect the Osiris-Rex spacecraft on a new mission to study the asteroid Apophis shortly after the 340m (1,115ft) wide lump of silicate and nickel iron passes within 20,000 miles (32,000km) of the Earth in 2029.

The European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope, meanwhile, is probing the very nature of the Universe. The first images from Euclid were released in November and cover a vast area of the sky in extraordinary detail. But cosmologists using the telescope are less interested in what they can see than what they can't.

Only 5% of the Universe is made of atoms – that's the stuff we can detect. The rest is known as ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"". Dark matter is theorised to be the scaffolding that holds everything in place and dark energy is the mysterious component that drives the expansion of the Universe.

""It's one of the biggest problems in physics,"" says Isobel Hook, professor of astrophysics at Lancaster University in the north of England. ""It's extremely frustrating that we don't know what it is and there's no real convincing theoretical explanation, certainly for dark energy.

""If you just look at the number of people involved in a mission like Euclid, you can see how important it is. There are thousands of people around the world involved in this, wanting to get to the answer.""

Euclid will observe billions of galaxies to build up a map of at least a third of the visible Universe

In April, scientists using the, now dismantled, Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile produced a new map of the distribution of dark matter. Over the next six years, Euclid will observe billions of galaxies to build up a map of at least a third of the visible Universe. Although it will not be able to see the missing matter, Euclid can detect its influence by observing how its gravity bends and distorts light, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.

""For dark matter, it will tell us where it is and map it out,"" says Hook. ""In terms of what dark matter and dark energy are, we'll be narrowing down the possibilities by seeing the effects.""

As for 2024, we can look forward to further robotic lunar missions, the launch of Europa Clipper to Jupiter's ice-covered moon and the maiden flight of Europe's (much delayed) new rocket Ariane 6. It should also see the most exciting human space mission in decades: Nasa's Artemis II. The first crewed launch of the SLS rocket and Orion capsule, the Artemis II mission will send four astronauts on a 21-day flight into deep space around the Moon.

If successful, Artemis II will set the stage for the first Moon landing since 1972. But that currently depends on Starship; third time lucky?

Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come.

February: TikTok bans go global

Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly.

In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.

In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions.

In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections.

March and May: Three US banks fail

The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"".

By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future.

May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America

Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape.

Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing.

The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter.

Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis.

The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.

May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap

There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap.

It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom.

July: Twitter becomes X

In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next.

Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.

Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.

Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content.

September: Rupert Murdoch steps down

After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair.

In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's.

October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial

Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.

Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.

One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more.

October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard

Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.

In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal.

November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection

Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning.

Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand.

December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court

At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward.

If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024.","Ten major events that shaped business in 2023By Meredith Turits Features correspondent @meredithturitsAlamySam Bankman-Fried's fall cast a shadow over crypto's legitimacy and future (Credit: Alamy)Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Meatballs are a classic comfort food beloved by all three Scandinavian nations (Credit: Columbus Leth)

The meatball in its myriad forms is well loved across Scandinavia. And in her book, Simply Scandinavian, Trine Hahnemann shares her secrets for a light and crispy version.

At this time of year in Scandinavia, as nights grow colder and darker and people gather around fires and cosy tables, the meatball really shines. A classic comfort food beloved by all three Scandinavian nations – Denmark, Sweden and Norway – meatballs are simultaneously an easy weeknight meal for busy families and the kind of dish you'd see on the menu for a large gathering or celebration.

The origin of the meatball is more than a little unclear. According to food historian Nina Bauer, like the pancake, the meatball was invented simultaneously in many countries worldwide, so no one country can lay claim to it. It remains, however, a classic food across Scandinavia, though not without its differences.

""We all have different words for them,"" Bauer said. ""In Denmark, we call a ball of meat that is pan-fried a frikadelle.""

The Danish meatball is a little rugged in texture and can be served in multiple ways – with a lightly spiced curry sauce, for example, or a rich gravy. A Swedish meatball, in comparison to the crispy, pan-fried Danish version, is often a little smaller, with a very smooth, even texture and a rounder shape. You shouldn't be able to spot any of the individual ingredients in a Swedish meatball, such as diced onions, plus it's eaten with lingonberry jam. In Norway, the meatball is larger and flatter and more like a meat patty, served with a brown gravy.

""In Denmark, we trace the roots of the frikadelle back to the 1600s, with a recipe, maybe German in origin, written for a sausage without a casing seasoned with saffron and ginger. This sausage without a casing becomes a meatball eaten in a soup and stew,"" said Bauer.

When meat grinders and cast-iron stove tops became common in Denmark in the mid-19th Century, everything changed for the meatball and its role in society.

""Before then, it was an aristocratic food because you needed a servant to work on the meat with a knife all morning,"" said Bauer. ""The arrival of the meat grinder democratises it all and a kind of euphoria takes place, where people start to think about what to do with it.""

Columbus Leth

Today, the modern-day Danish meatball comes in different guises. Trine Hahnemann, cook and author of the recently published cookbook Simply Scandinavian, said this is partly because there is a lot of minced meat available in Denmark, thanks to the many milking cows on its farms.

""When they get slaughtered, you have to make mincemeat out of them,"" she said. ""You can't use the meat in any other way. So, we have many traditional meals that stem from this minced meat, including frikadeller (plural) and meatballs in curry sauce. I grew up eating meatballs in a celeriac sauce, and we always ate the leftovers the next day on rye bread.""

Food waste is a big focus for Hahnemann, who notes that the meatball is so important that she has never written a cookbook without a frikadelle recipe in it. ""It is a good way to get use out of your leftovers,"" she said. ""You can put vegetables in them and stretch out the meat.""

Hahnemann's meatball is quintessentially Danish, but she acknowledges that the addition of courgette and sparkling water is a little unusual. If you don't eat red meat, you can use minced chicken instead of pork and beef, advises Hahnemann. Or, for a vegetarian version, grate a variety of root vegetables to replace the minced meat.

Her best advice for making a light fried Danish meatball is to do something her family has been doing for generations. ""If you want them to be not too heavy, go easy on the flour,"" she advised. ""Don't use milk because that makes them heavy – use sparkling water. That's a piece of advice my grandmother passed on to me. It feels counter intuitive, but it makes the meatball lighter and fluffier.""

Frikadeller with sweet and sour cucumber salad recipe by Trine Hahnemann

Serves 4

Ingredients For the salad: 250ml (1 cup) distilled vinegar (5% acid) 50ml (¼ cup) water 125g (4½oz) caster (superfine) sugar 1 tsp flaked sea salt (or kosher salt) freshly ground black pepper 1 tsp mustard seeds 1 tsp black peppercorns 2 large cucumbers For the meatballs: 250g (9oz) minced (ground) pork 250g (9oz) minced (ground) beef 1 courgette (zucchini), grated (shredded) 1 onion, grated (shredded) 2 garlic cloves, grated (shredded) 1 tbsp chopped thyme leaves 3 eggs, lightly beaten 50g (1¾oz) breadcrumbs 3 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour 50ml (¼ cup) sparkling water 50g (½ stick) salted butter 2 tbsp neutral-tasting vegetable oil

Method

Step 1 Start with the cucumber salad because it needs to pickle for 30 minutes. Whisk together the vinegar, water and sugar. When all the sugar has dissolved, add the salt and some ground black pepper, along with the mustard seeds and peppercorns. Halve the cucumbers lengthways, scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon, then cut into half-moons 5mm (¼in) thick. Place the cucumbers in the brine, gently folding now and then, until ready to serve.

Step 2 To make the meatballs, mix the minced meats, courgette, onion, garlic, thyme and eggs together and mix well. Fold in the breadcrumbs and flour and mix again. Lastly, mix in the sparkling water and season with salt and pepper.

Step 3 Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4. Melt the butter and oil in a frying pan (skillet). Use a spoon and your free hand to shape the meat mixture into medium-sized oval balls. Place in the butter and oil and fry on all sides until golden brown.

Step 4 Transfer to an ovenproof dish and bake in the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking. Take the cucumber out of the brine (you can reuse the brine, so don't throw it away), and serve it in a bowl alongside the frikadeller.

Britain's most famous steam locomotive turned 100 this year, and along the way it has inspired poets, Hitchcock, Harry Potter and Royalty. What makes it such an enduring icon?

Some grow misty-eyed with nostalgia at the mere mention of them, waiting for hours on a windy platform just to get a glimpse or a photo of these stars of a bygone age. Others find them smelly, dirty, and their hooting and screeching too much to bear. We're talking about steam engines, and although travelling by locomotive may be a rare treat for most, the golden age of steam is being kept alive at the many heritage railways around the world, with more than 30 still running in the UK alone.

More like this:

Firmly in the steam-age fan camp is presenter and author Michael Palin – a self-confessed train spotter who, in a 1980 BBC documentary, reflected: ""I suppose true railway buffs love all engines – short, fat, squat, long. Rumbling smelly diesels or swiftly silent electrics. But most of all, they love steam… And the most famous steam engine of them all is the Flying Scotsman.""

The locomotive's history has had many highs and lows

Today, the Flying Scotsman is still arguably the most famous steam locomotive on the planet, drawing huge crowds whenever it makes an appearance. Since it turned 100 in February, there have been celebrations and steam-related events to mark its grand old age, including a visit by the King in June; culminating in a Christmas programme of excursions at the National Rail Museum, which owns it. Not to mention an illustrated children's book on the steam age by Michael Morpurgo; a tribute poem by Simon Armitage; and a new film featuring those whose lives have been touched by it.

What is it about the Flying Scotsman that has led to its enduring fame and popularity above all other steam engines? Why has it earned a place in the hearts of many nations, but especially the Brits? The locomotive's history has had many highs and lows, and a moment when it seemed destined for the scrapheap, only to be saved for the modern age.

Completed in February 1923, at a cost of almost £8,000, the Flying Scotsman was originally built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), to a design by its chief engineer, Sir Nigel Gresley. It weighed 97 tonnes, was 70ft in length, and was one of the Pacific type (class A1) express tender locomotives – the most powerful used by the railway.

It was not, in fact, built in Scotland, as many believe, but in Doncaster in the north of England; and the story behind its naming holds a clue to its early fame, says Andrew Mclean, chief curator at the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York. ""The locomotive was deliberately named by the LNER after the 'Flying Scotsman', which was the unofficial name of its famous flagship service, the Special Scotch Express; launched in 1852, it ran daily from London's King's Cross to Edinburgh,"" he says. LNER advertised that service as ""The Most Famous Train in the World""; that, coupled with the public's confusion over the difference between a locomotive and a train, boosted its fame no end. (To clarify, Scotsman is a locomotive or engine, and pulls the carriages of a train.)

""Scotsman was not revolutionary in the way George and Robert Stephenson's Rocket was,"" says Mclean, referring to the 1829 steam locomotive considered the greatest innovation of the Victorian era. ""Nor was it the largest, most powerful or fastest.""

Being selected for the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley in 1924 kickstarted its fame, and since then it has broken numerous records. In 1928, it hauled the first nonstop run of the northbound Flying Scotsman train service; in 1934 it set the world steam speed record of 100mph (though it was beaten a year later by Papyrus, a sister loco); in Australia it made the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive at 422 miles in 1989; on the way back to England the next year, it became the first steam locomotive to circumnavigate the globe (with the aid of a ship, of course).

But it's not all been about piston-pumping strength – or as Poet Laureate Armitage puts it in his paean to the engine: ""its vast steel circumferences, straining, hissing, the rippling bodywork pouring with sweat, skirts trimmed with petticoats of steam"". Scotsman has been sprinkled with glamour and media innovation too, pulling trains on which cinema, radio and television were trialled, as well as a Louis XV-style restaurant and even a cocktail bar.

Charisma and drama

If an engine can have charisma and drama, it was first realised in the eponymously titled 1930 film, one of Britain's first ""Talkies"". It's astonishing now to imagine that actress Pauline Johnson was allowed to do her own stunts for it, clinging to the outside of the speeding loco. Director Alfred Hitchcock gave it a key role in his 1935 spy suspense film, The 39 Steps, as Robert Donat's character flees from assassins by boarding a Scotsman-led train from London to Edinburgh. As this century dawned, it was the role model for Harry Potter's Hogwarts Express, it has been claimed, famously arriving on platform 9¾ at King's Cross, and now on public show at Warner Bros studio tour London.

Hogwarts' engine is red – not a Scotsman hue. Its original colour was apple green, and in World War Two it was repainted wartime black, like all railway stock, returning to green after the war. It was all change again in 1948, when British Railways (BR) was formed, and UK rail travel was nationalised; the Scotsman was painted blue for a time, then BR Green, and numbered 60103 (its sixth and current number).

BR's modernisation in 1955 sounded a death knell for the steam age, and 1962 was the Scotsman's last full year of service. BR's last mainline steam-hauled passenger train ran on 11 August 1968. That evening, a documentary commemorated the end of the steam age, and among passengers travelling on Scotsman's non-stop from London to Edinburgh was the Reverend W Awdrey, who mourned the end of steam in one of his celebrated Thomas the Tank Engine stories, illustrated by John T Kenney.

Scotsman could have been consigned to the great loco scrapyard in the sky, but for a programme on its plight in 1966 on Blue Peter, the popular BBC children's series, that was prompted by thousands of children writing in protest. That, coupled with a growing interest in national heritage, led to it being rescued and restored by steam-loving businessmen, including Alan Pegler, Sir William McAlpine, and later pop music producer Pete Waterman. In 2004 it was acquired by the NRM, its future safe for now.

The Scotsman may be a national treasure, but it's not without competition. ""There's one locomotive that may draw a higher appeal and that would be Mallard,"" says Mclean referring to the fastest steam locomotive in the world. That doesn't seem to dent the Scotsman's appeal to enthusiastic crowds who cheer it on whenever it appears on tours of the US, Canada and Australia. When not on exhibit at the NMR in York, England, it can be found pulling excursions along the mainline or on British tourist railroads.

There is a degree of nostalgia attached to it, and harking back to a bygone age – but what's remarkable is that Scotsman still does its thing – Steve Morgan

Steve Morgan was the official photographer who documented Scotsman's centenary, and witnessed first-hand the excitement it can generate: ""I was amazed by its popularity,"" he says, ""and by the people who love it, from traditional steam engine freaks to young girls and women. They all seem to have a very personal attachment to it.""

Besides photographing the King with Scotsman and its crew, Morgan captured it being restored and maintained, giving an idea of its great size; and the women train drivers who took charge of it as part of International Women's Day. In the name of research, he even managed to squeeze into the engine's firebox, into which the fireman has the hard physical task of shovelling tonnes of coal. ""It was smelly and dirty, as you'd imagine, but fascinating too."" The coal used was once supplied by British mines until they shut down, and until recent years came from Russia; now it mostly comes from Poland and Czechia. The use of bio coal is being considered, says Mclean.

Morgan adds: ""Yes, there is a degree of nostalgia attached to it, and harking back to a bygone age. But what's remarkable is that Scotsman still does its thing. It has a life and an energy about it that a lot of other machines just don't.""

Mclean mulls over what Scotsman might mean to the Scottish people. Its name is perhaps confusing, since ""it only ran in service to Scotland for 10 years, from 1925 to 1935 – and then didn't make it over the border again until well into the 1960s"". He says in recent years, images of the Flying Scotsman puffing across the Forth Bridge have ""probably reinforced the idea that it's a Scottish icon, and the fact its designer, Gresley, was born in Edinburgh"".

Steve Morgan/ Science Museum Group

On the other hand, he adds: ""When it toured north America in the 1960s, it was billed as a British Trade Mission and was seen as symbolic of Britishness. [It toured] along with some mixed stereotypes including a butler hired from Fortnum and Mason, a Pipe Major, a man dressed in a suit of armour and, bizarrely, a Winston Churchill impersonator played by Churchill's own nephew."" Perhaps one of the iconic steam engine's greatest achievements is being a survivor, and its most recent record is as the oldest locomotive to travel on British railway tracks. It shows no sign of stopping doing what it does best.

""When you think about it, we've got these great symbols of British engineering and innovation, like Concorde and the Queen Mary,"" says Mclean. ""But while you can no longer travel in either of those, you can still travel by Flying Scotsman, which is pretty incredible.""","But most of all, they love steam… And the most famous steam engine of them all is the Flying Scotsman.""
The locomotive's history has had many highs and lowsToday, the Flying Scotsman is still arguably the most famous steam locomotive on the planet, drawing huge crowds whenever it makes an appearance.

From new artificial islands to the environmental devastation caused by the breach of Ukraine's Kakhovka Dam – this is how humanity has changed the face of our planet throughout the past year.

There are few places on the Earth where humans have not left a mark of some kind. An estimated 95% of our planet's landmass – not including Antarctica, even though humanity has left its imprint there, too – now show some signs of human activity. About 16% of that land has been heavily modified, according to one recent analysis.

Urban development, large-scale engineering works and mining projects are reshaping entire landscapes, while deforestation and agriculture are altering entire ecosystems. Pollution produced by humans can be found in almost every corner of our planet.

Earth's reshaping continued apace during 2023 – for better and for worse. Here are some of the most dramatic ways our species has changed the planet's surface this year.

Just two years ago, Pearson Reef in the South China Sea was little more than a tiny atoll among more than 100 reefs and specks of sand-covered coral – when viewed from space – that make up the Spratly Islands (see the image below to see how it looked in 2021). But Vietnam, which has occupied the island since the late 1970s, embarked on a major enlargement project towards the end of 2021. By dredging and landfilling, the country has added 163 acres (66ha) of land to the island, and created a sheltered harbour in the middle of the reef, which can be seen in this satellite image above taken in August 2023.

The growth in electric vehicles and other battery-powered devices, demand for lithium has soared in recent years. But warnings of an impending shortage of this critical metal in years to come has prompted a scrabble to open new mines to extract it. Among those to begin operations in 2023 was the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina's Jujuy Province. The bright-green evaporation ponds are clearly visible in this satellite image from Maxar Technologies. The lithium is extracted from the salt of the South American salars – salt flats – by turning it into a brine that is then evaporated to concentrate the lithium.

In the Shan Mountains of eastern Myanmar, shifting agricultural practices have transformed the surface of Inle Lake. Recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site, the lake is famous for floating gardens created by the villagers who live along its shores, as well as fishermen who row with their legs. But a growth in the large scale aquaculture of tomatoes has dramatically decreased the surface area of the lake.

Water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir in Ukraine have fallen drastically after its dam was destroyed, causing widespread ecological damage (Credit: Getty Images)

On 6 June 2023, a series of early morning blasts cracked open the Kakhovka Dam, causing water to surge into the Dnipro River and leading to severe flooding downstream in the days that followed. Ukraine's military accused Russia of deliberately blowing up the dam, while Russia blamed the Ukrainians. Without the dam to hold back the water, the landscape both above and below the dam was transformed over the months that followed. A network of canals that were fed by the reservoir ran dry during the summer and leaving those working in the surrounding farmland struggling to irrigate their crops.

Before the explosions, the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir were the highest they had been in a number of years, but after the dam was breached, it almost dried up. An assessment by the UN Environment Programme described the damage as a ""far-reaching environmental disaster"" that would stretch far beyond Ukraine's borders. The reservoir itself had been a fully functioning ecosystem that was decimated, while flooding downstream caused considerable damage to natural habitats and plant communities. The organisation warned that the damage caused by the breach of the dam was likely to be ""irreversible"".

The dam, which Ethiopia wants to use to produce electricity, has been a hugely controversial issue, as it could also give the country's government control over its neighbours' water supply.

Stretching like an enormous scar across the desert are the foundations of a portion of The Line – a 170km (105 miles)-long city being constructed in Neom, a huge territory on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Construction work on the project – which Saudi Arabia has been keen to promote as a high-tech eco-city that will be the ""blueprint for tomorrow"" – can be seen at one end of a road stretching between Gayal and Ras Al Sheikh Al Hamid. Some critics have also ⁠questioned the planned city's green credentials.

Workers faced both existential crises and found competitive advantages in AI this year (Credit: Alamy)

Heralded and decried in equal measure, artificial intelligence has already changed how we work now, and how we will in the future.

It has been just more than a year since OpenAI launched its chatbot, ChatGPT, yet the technology is already top of mind for most workers. In many cases, it's become a part of their daily routines.

AI has gone from feeling like an abstract idea to a familiar tool that can streamline workflows and generate new ideas. But not everyone has welcomed the technology, and instead see it as a threat to their very careers. It's a push-and-pull that's defined this year.

The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it. They also give us a peek into how AI might shape 2024, as the technology continues to evolve at lightning pace.

Workers are already depending on AI

Many employees have grown accustomed to using AI in their daily jobs for time-saving administrative tasks, particularly rudimentary writing and basic ideation. This is especially the case in knowledge-work positions, where AI shows potential to free up workers to do creative, more sophisticated tasks. (Some workers are even using the technology to write resumes and cover letters to get those jobs in the first place.)

But as more workers utilise AI, some employers are responding by curbing the technology's use in the workplace. This has included tacitly suppressing or outright banning access to tools like ChatGPT, with organisations worried about potential misuse or data leaks, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US.

Yet some employees who've come to heavily rely on the tools, whether for increased productivity or to get a leg up on colleagues, have had to backchannel to retain access. Social-media communities have even offered tips on how to secretly access the technology at work.

Some skilled jobs workers considered shielded from generative AI are now facing threats with evolving technology (Credit: Alamy)

AI is evolving to target some office jobs

Many people assumed AI would most likely replace humans in roles that are easily automated: think the customer service chatbots and grocery-delivering robots already busy at work.

But as it has evolved in the past year, it's clear that it could impact more complex knowledge work roles once considered ""safe"". Some creative jobs are already being threatened. For example, text-to-image generative AI programs like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create dazzling illustrations and photorealistic renders in moments – work that's typically reserved for highly skilled commercial art teams.

Data shows there's validity to workers' worries. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans – equating to 300 million jobs lost across Europe and the US.

""This isn't somebody else's problem now. It's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at US economic think tank organisation the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC. ""We don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""

But some jobs won't be replaced – yet

For all the fear, however, there are many roles and tasks that AI won't be capable of performing in the near future. That's particularly the case with jobs that demand soft skills, such as emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking.

Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, believes workers whose job it is to come up with new business strategies may be relatively safe from automation. He also predicts roles that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships – for example, nurses and business consultants – are hard for machines to replace. These are jobs, he says, that require ""a very deep understanding of people. I think it'll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships"".

Additionally, trade jobs that far pre-date digital work environments – such as electricians, plumbers and welders – are among the ""hardest of anything to automate"", says Ford. These jobs are less reliant on language-based tasks and typically require greater problem-solving ability, mobility and dexterity in unpredictable environments that machines cannot currently mimic.

We're also going to work with AI

As AI becomes more ubiquitous, some experts believe the technology is actually more likely to augment – rather than replace – human talent. Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, cites medical diagnoses as an example. While a robot may be able to detect cancer, for instance, most patients would prefer a qualified medical professional to break the news.

Workers are already utilising ChatGPT as a personal assistant, using it to draft emails, plan itineraries and project costs and timelines. More broadly, professionals are already using AI to help eliminate bias in decision making – some large corporations are already employing data-driven recruitment to test candidates' qualities, with behavioural insights matching them with the right vacancy.

And while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones; for example, data engineers, governance specialists and a host of ""training"" roles.

Alongside much fear and uncertainty, there's optimism

AI may be the technology of the day, but it's far from the first to disrupt the workforce. Technology has advanced exponentially over the decades, from the rise of automation in mechanics, to office computers and wireless internet.

""Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, it has the potential to automate or streamline work processes,"" says Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at PwC, based in Austin, US. ""However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements.""","The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it.

From Toronto to Tokyo, these five cities remain surprisingly affordable compared to their more costly neighbours.

Prices have been rising rapidly in cities across the world, driving the cost of living higher than ever before. In fact, the average price of goods and services rose 7.4% year over year, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) recently released 2023 Worldwide Cost of Living Report. That's marked a huge jump from the 2.9% average over the past five years.

But not everywhere has been impacted equally. The report ranks 173 cities based on prices of food, clothing, rent and transportation and other costs of 200+ goods and services. When compared to the report's global index, some cities remain relatively low-cost compared to places like Singapore and Zurich, both of which tied for the most expensive place to live. Many cities in Asia, for instance, became relatively less expensive, with 46 out of 58 cities slipping down the rankings due to a more sluggish economic recovery.

Some cities also remain surprisingly affordable compared to their more-costly neighbours. For travellers or digital nomads, these places can offer the same big-city amenities at a much lower cost of living. We spoke to residents and recent travellers to the cities that ranked as less expensive on the annual EIU index when compared to their continent's other cities, and heard their advice on what makes living more affordable – and how to make the travel cash go even further.

Lisbon, Portugal

As the least-expensive city in Western Europe, according to the EIU rankings, Lisbon has been a hotspot for digital nomads in recent years, especially due to its 2022 digital nomad visa that lets freelancers and remote workers stay for one to two years. Its relatively lower costs (56% lower than other cities in Western Europe, according to travel cost site Expatistan) also make it an attractive destination for travellers.

""Lisbon was one of the top cities on my bucket list, and this summer, I was finally able to see this vibrant destination for myself,"" said Mercedes Zach of Asaptickets. ""It is not only beautiful, welcoming and fun, but also full of budget-friendly things to do.""

Zach recommends exploring the bohemian Bairro Alto neighbourhood to uncover street art, city views and sunset gatherings with locals. She also enjoyed exploring the free Parque Eduardo VII central park, which features estufas (greenhouses) that showcase exotic plants from Portugal and the tropics. The free Museu do Teatro Romano gives a peek into the city's Roman past, with preserved theatre ruins.

To experience authentic fado music, Zach suggests heading to the affordable Tasca do Chico. ""The old, cosy tavern is adorned with photos, posters and clippings of the soulful fado singers and performers and the atmosphere there is genuinely authentic,"" she said. ""It also offers amazing live fado shows without any entrance fees."" She recommends going on Mondays or Wednesdays, when there's local singers and fewer crowds.

Buenos Aires, Argentina

With the worst inflation rates in the world and plummeting currency valuations, Buenos Aires made the bottom 10 cities of the index – ranking 163 out of 173. The currency destabilisation has brought more strength than ever to the US dollar, which is sought after by residents as a way to preserve their savings. Known as the dólar blue or ""blue dollar rate"", this exchange rate is often taken advantage of by travellers on the ground via Western Union.

Money here goes much further than it did even five years ago, but it helps to be savvy about it. ""One thing I picked up is that it's way better to pay in cash rather than using a foreign credit card,"" said Josephine Remo Finderup, a writer and a digital nomad. ""It's one of those little tricks that really makes a difference in how far your money goes."" Because rent and food are so much more affordable here, she's planning to stay six months before heading back to Europe.

The right neighbourhood can also lower costs. Alex Trembath, travel blogger at Career Gappers, recently stayed in the historic San Telmo neighbourhood, which he found was an ideal base for budget activities. ""There's a lively weekly market on Sundays, many affordable places to eat and drink, and some fantastic free walking tours to explore the art and culture of the area and the nearby Boca neighbourhood,"" he said.

He also went to a milonganight, where visitors can learn how to tango with locals. ""It's a lot cheaper than going to one of the touristy tango shows,"" he said. ""And a more authentic experience.""

Travellers find Toronto to be an affordable and welcoming destination, especially for families (Credit: Istvan Kadar Photography/Getty Images)

Toronto, Canada

While North American inflation has slowed, big US cities like New York and Los Angeles still rank within the top-10 most-expensive places in the world. Meanwhile, Canadian cities to the north continue to remain lower in the cost-of-living rankings. Of all the Canadian cities ranked, Toronto ranks the most affordable, coming in at number 27.

Combined with being one of the world's most liveable cities, travellers find Toronto to be an affordable and welcoming destination, especially for families.

Toronto resident Stephanie Ciccarelli, co-founder of vacation rental platform Lake, recommends city sightseeing via boat cruise on Lake Ontario, visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame, or ascending the iconic CN Tower. ""A fan favourite is going up the tower in its high-speed elevator to walk the iconic observation deck for a panoramic view of the cityscape and waterfront,"" said Ciccarelli.

Toronto is also known as ""the City within a Park"", with plenty of green space available for time in nature. ""I love being able to leave my apartment and go on a nice walk or hike and enjoy the outdoors,"" said Toronto resident Natalia Buia. Her favourites include High Park, Trinity Bellwoods and Toronto Island Park.

And while she says inflation can definitely still be felt here, you can find a diverse array of food at every price point. ""Whether you want to grab a bite at a local dive or spoil yourself with fine dining, you can find literally any type of food you want at any time of day,"" said Buia. ""Much like in New York, there's no shortage of exquisite restaurant options – but I argue it's a tad bit more affordable here!""

Tokyo, Japan

Moving three down the index this year and ranking 60 overall, Tokyo continues to be Japan's most expensive city yet is now more affordable than fellow Asian cities like Singapore and Hong Kong. While other countries battle inflation, Japan has been in a multi-year battle with deflation, trying to maintain the monetary strength of the yen. This combined with Japan only recently completely reopening to tourism post-Covid makes it an especially affordable time for travellers to visit.

""The cost of living in Tokyo ranks well behind cities like New York City, London and Singapore,"" said Tokyo resident Masa Yamamoto, senior manager of corporate communications at real-estate developer Mori. That makes the urban attractions and big-city experiences much more accessible here, and the plentiful nature opportunities within the city itself can keep costs low.

Yamamoto encourages tourists to stroll the 24,000 sq m of urban gardens and public art installations at the newly developed Azabudai Hills neighbourhood for free. ""Visitors will be surrounded by 320 species of plants and can enjoy an orchard with 11 types of fruit trees, including mandarin oranges, blueberries, lemons, apples, peaches and plums,"" he said.

For a new perspective on the city, he recommends the contemporary art Mori Art Museum and its connected Tokyo City View, which offers a view of the city from 250m above sea level for just 2,000 yen.

Perth, Australia

Ranking as much more affordable than its eastern neighbours Sydney and Melbourne, Perth offers residents a laid-back lifestyle that's made even easier with its temperate climate, beautiful beaches and abundant nature. Since Perth has a high number of employees in the mining sector, salaries also tend to be higher here, which gives locals more spending power.

""Perth's affordability lets me live a more relaxed lifestyle. My rent would double or even triple for a comparable apartment in Sydney,"" said Nadia Cuthbertson, Perth resident and founder of Perth Weekend. ""I've got more disposable income to get out and about and enjoy activities like cocktails at rooftop bars and seafood dinners overlooking the ocean.""

Her favourite rooftop spots include the Rooftop at QT for its spectacular view, and Mechanics Institute for its more laid-back atmosphere, but she also recommends fish and chips at the iconic Cottesloe Beach as the sun sets over the ocean. For those looking to explore nature, she recommends renting a catamaran from South Perth Foreshore to sail the Swan River, or trying snorkelling at Mettams Pool, a naturally formed lagoon featuring starfish and molluscs.

Many cities in Asia, for instance, became relatively less expensive, with 46 out of 58 cities slipping down the rankings due to a more sluggish economic recovery.
Its relatively lower costs (56% lower than other cities in Western Europe, according to travel cost site Expatistan) also make it an attractive destination for travellers.

Virat Kohli was the last wicket to fall as India were bowled out for their fifth-lowest total against South Africa

First Test, Centurion Park, Centurion: (day three of five) India 245 (Rahul 101; Rabada 5-59) & 131 (Kohli 76; Burger 4-33) South Africa 408 (Elgar 185, Jansen 84*; Bumrah 4-65) South Africa win by an innings and 32 runs Scorecard

Virat Kohli's defiant 76 failed to save India from being thrashed by an innings and 32 runs by South Africa in the first Test at Centurion.

India lost seven second-innings wickets in the evening session as they were bowled out for just 131 in 34.1 overs.

Kohli and Shubman Gill (26) were the only India batters into double figures as Nandre Burger (4-33) and Marco Jansen (3-36) did the damage.

The second and final Test starts on 3 January at Newlands in Cape Town.

India captain Rohit Sharma said his side's performance after a defeat inside three days was ""not good enough"" and they ""failed"" to ""come together collectively"".

""Guys have come here before, we understand what to expect from the conditions. Every individual has his own plan,"" Rohit said.

""Our batters were challenged at different times. We didn't adapt well. We didn't bat well both times which is why we stand here.""

Earlier in the day, South Africa had posted a commanding 408 in response to India's first-innings total of 245.

Dean Elgar, who announced he would retire from international cricket after the series against India, played freely to make a classy 185 while Jansen hit an unbeaten 84.

India were 62-3 at tea with Kagiso Rabada, who took 5-59 in the first innings, capturing the key wicket of India skipper Rohit.

However, the tourists lost seven wickets for just 59 runs in the evening session as South Africa's seamers ran through their middle order.

Kohli made a determined 76 from 82 balls but he was last man out - caught brilliant by Rabada off Jansen - as extras third top-scored for India with eight runs.

Player of the match Elgar said: ""You need fast bowlers and a spinner, potentially, to take 20 wickets. You need guys firing.

""Kagiso Rabada was amazing, and a guy like Nandre just came to the fore. It was a really great team performance.""","Last updated on .From the section CricketVirat Kohli was the last wicket to fall as India were bowled out for their fifth-lowest total against South AfricaFirst Test, Centurion Park, Centurion: (day three of five) India 245 (Rahul 101; Rabada 5-59) & 131 (Kohli 76; Burger 4-33) South Africa 408 (Elgar 185, Jansen 84*; Bumrah 4-65) South Africa win by an innings and 32 runs ScorecardVirat Kohli's defiant 76 failed to save India from being thrashed by an innings and 32 runs by South Africa in the first Test at Centurion.

Manu Tuilagi played six matches for England at the 2023 Rugby World Cup

Centre Manu Tuilagi is expected to miss the start of England's Six Nations campaign with a groin injury.

Tuilagi suffered a grade three tear in the second half of Sale's 22-20 Premiership win over Saracens at the Salford Community Stadium last Friday.

The 32-year-old, capped 60 times by England, was plagued by a long-term groin problem earlier in his career.

Tuilagi is likely to miss England's opening Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on 3 February.

They will then face Wales at Twickenham the following week.

Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson said Tuilagi's injury would not require surgery and that the player himself was determined to get fit as soon as possible.

""Manu has pulled his groin and we think he's going to be back during the Six Nations, but not for the first week,"" Sanderson said.

""Six weeks is the recommended time for the injury and Manu is saying four. I spoke to him and he's like, 'I need to play and if I'm good to play it's up to England regarding selection'.

""He was in the frame before and I've stated before his intent to keep playing international rugby.""

Steve Smith fell for 50 to Shaheen Afridi from the last ball of the day, with Australia 241 ahead

Second Test, Melbourne Cricket Ground (day three of five): Australia 318 (96.5 overs) & 187-6 (62.3 overs): Marsh 96, Smith 50; Hamza 3-27 Pakistan 264 (73.5 overs): Shafique 62; Cummins 5-48 Australia lead Pakistan by 241 runs Scorecard

Australia took control of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne to end day three with a lead of 241 runs over Pakistan.

The hosts were in trouble when they slipped to 16-4, for a lead of just 70, before Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith's crucial fifth-wicket stand of 153.

Marsh scored 96 from 130 balls and Smith fell to the last ball of the day for 50 as Australia finished on 187-6.

Smith's dismissal gave Pakistan hope, but they were left to rue Abdullah Shafique's drop of Marsh on 20.

Pakistan started the day on 194-6, still 124 runs behind Australia's first-innings score, but Mohammad Rizwan's 42, and contributions of 33 not out and 21 from Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Afridi respectively, reduced their deficit to just 54.

Australia captain Pat Cummins finished with 5-48, his 10th Test five-wicket haul, while off-spinner Nathan Lyon took 4-73 as Pakistan were bowled out for 264.

Pakistan fought back with the new ball as Australia opener Usman Khawaja fell to Shaheen from the second ball of their reply and Marnus Labuschagne was caught behind for four off the same bowler in the third over.

Mir Hamza then took two wickets in two balls, bowling David Warner for just six and Travis Head for a first-ball duck.

Marsh survived the hat-trick ball and led a mini-recovery with Smith to 46-4 before his reprieve at slip saw Pakistan's confidence fade, the all-rounder reaching a counter-attacking 50 from 70 balls.

The impressive Hamza finished with 3-27 as Marsh was eventually caught off his bowling at slip by Salman Agha, before Smith's contrasting innings of 50 from 176 balls was ended by him gloving a hostile short ball from Shaheen to gully.

Alex Carey will resume unbeaten on 16 on day four with Pakistan already facing a difficult chase on a wearing pitch.","The hosts were in trouble when they slipped to 16-4, for a lead of just 70, before Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith's crucial fifth-wicket stand of 153.

Today, it is just Little Nicky on The Hill.

In seven months or so, it will be teeming with spectators, sunbathing, sipping and soaking up Wimbledon's atmosphere and giant-screen action.

But now, as autumn turns towards winter, they are gone. The screen is too. And Little Nicky - as the All England Club groundstaff have dubbed their small GPS-guided robotic mower - is alone, trundling up and down the slope, trimming back any new growth.

Little Nicky is not the only difference. Wimbledon has one of sport and summer's most recognisable palettes; sun-bleached whites, electric blue skies, two-tone lawn green and the occasional pop of scarlet strawberry.

In the drizzle and gloom, with the courts stripped back to bare postage stamps of turf and the seats hooded in tarpaulin, it is a more muted colour scheme. Ivy, that blends into the background in the summer, takes centre stage, wrapping Centre Court in a burnt orange.

It feels quiet, but, out of sight, plenty of work is under way.

""For me, it is probably as busy as any time of year,"" says Neil Stubley, head of courts and horticulture.

He has just been at a meeting reviewing July's championships. It was the 28th Wimbledon that Stubley (below) has worked on since his first, as a student, in 1995.

While he also has responsibility for areas like the Hill and Wimbledon Park golf course, which the All England Club bought in 2018, Stubley's primary focus is the same as most fans; the courts.

""Centre Court is probably one of the most scrutinised pieces of turf in the world,"" he says.

""We all come in with eyes wide open, we know what the challenge is.""

By now, he will know more about the challenge for 2024. A 200-page document was set to land in his in-tray shortly before Christmas, postmarked from Bingley, West Yorkshire.

It will contain tens of thousands of data points collected by a team of three specialists from the town's Sports Turf Research Institute. The trio travel down the week before the Championship and test the courts, every morning and evening for the following three.

One test involves dropping a ball in select spots and measuring height of its bounce. In another, they insert a probe to different depths in the soil to collect moisture content readings. One analyst will get on their hands and knees to count the living blades within a wooden quadrant.

Hidden in the data, Stubley and his team will search for clues as to how they might make the grass last a little longer or the ball bounce a bit more consistently next year.

A lot depends on the weather. The key is keeping the surface hard enough for play, while locking in enough moisture lower down for the grass to stay alive.

But other factors are even harder to predict. London's foxes prowl the premises at night and their urine, high in nitrates, can scorch the summer grass.

""If you get a rogue patch going off colour, you can stick your trusty knife in there, give it a sniff, and you will know exactly if a fox has weed on there,"" says Stubley.

""Then you try to dilute it with a load of water, but sometimes the grass will die. Then it is a case of putting down what we call 'groundman's paint' - grass clippings.

""That doesn't affect the play, because the characteristics of the court are in the soil, not the turf.""

Such last-minute touch-ups are far from the mind of Will Brierley, the senior groundsperson who looks after the Championship courts, at the moment.

His task for autumn is the renovation of the courts. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam played on a living surface, and also the only one hosted by a members' club.

The All England Club regulars, who total about 500, play on the outside courts from mid-May though to mid-September.

When the Championships are over, Brierley and his team have to juggle keeping courts available to members while getting the necessary repairs done. Now that the entire season is finished, sunlamps bathe baselines in UV light. But, regardless, nature still holds sway.

""Everything in my day-to-day is dictated by the weather,"" says Brierley, who admits that his lawn at home is ""one quarter artificial turf, three quarters ruined by dogs"".

""Tennis is played on a clay soil so when it rains hard it really restricts what we can do.

""When it is hammering down it is a case of getting on top of tidying the storeroom, auditing machinery, training staff and checking tools.

""It can get a bit tedious and frustrating. This year we had a very wet October and start of November.

""We could have done with another week or so of dry weather. Then I think we would have been exactly where I want us to be.""

Martyn Falconer has a little more freedom from the forecast. As head gardener, he is in charge of the 50,000 plants that decorate the 42-acre site, fulfilling Wimbledon's promise of staging ""tennis in an English garden"".

Whatever the weather, there are hedges to trim, weeds to pull or compost to dig in. Ten thousand bulbs have just been planted. They will emerge, bloom and die back, all unseen by the half a million or more spectators who arrive later in the year during the Championship fortnight.

Weekly deliveries of plants in anticipation of the tournament, all logged in a master spreadsheet by Falconer, begin in early May and continue right up to the start of the Championships in July. The questions - from suppliers and others - start long before.

""The pressure slowly ramps up,"" he says. ""Everyone comes back from Christmas and realises we have got a Championship!

""I have been here long enough to realise what is coming. It feels quite quiet, but it is just brewing…""

Falconer is attempting to stay in front of another trend - the warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers caused by climate change.

""The hotter summers mean we are looking at plants that will work well with less water,"" he says.

""It has certainly got hotter in the 24 years since I started here.

""In previous autumns I would be out on the tools, cutting hedges or tidying leaves and it was really cold. I would be all wrapped up. Now you can get away with just a jacket, you are more worried about staying dry than staying warm.""

However the conditions fluctuate, for many of its fans, Wimbledon is a constant; a manicured corner of England which they can depend on summer after summer, year after year.

""There was a letter a few years ago that sticks in my mind,"" Falconer says.

""It was from someone who comes back every year. She used to enjoy the rose arbour with her husband. He has since died but she still comes back and sits there every year and enjoys it. She just said how it amazing it always looks.

""Little things like that are so nice.""","Wimbledon has one of sport and summer's most recognisable palettes; sun-bleached whites, electric blue skies, two-tone lawn green and the occasional pop of scarlet strawberry.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/67631299,Afcon 2023: Does the club versus country dilemma still exist for players and fans?,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Sport Africa

Afcon: Club or country - what matters more?

As the world's top football clubs prepare to lose key players during the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), is the perennial club versus country issue still relevant?

Leading players including Mohamed Salah, Victor Osimhen and Achraf Hakimi will be in Ivory Coast for the continent's showpiece event, which kicks off on 13 January and ends on 11 February - the tournament being officially branded as '2023' even though the finals are taking place in 2024.

Although it will coincide with winter breaks across some European leagues, clubs will face a number of weeks without first-team regulars.

BBC Sport Africa has been looking at the impact of another mid-season Afcon on players, clubs, managers and fans.

Do players face a dilemma?

Brentford midfielder Frank Onyeka is preparing for his second Afcon with Nigeria, having featured in Cameroon in early 2022.

""I'll always want to represent my country on the big stage. It's an honour to wear the green and white shirt, so it's something that I have to do,"" he told BBC Sport Africa.

""I was a boy playing in the streets of Nigeria and now I'm representing the Super Eagles at Afcon.

""It is a dream come true, because after watching Afcon legends in past years, now you're going to be part of the team. I'm looking forward to it so much.""

Onyeka has been a regular in Brentford's starting XI this season along with fellow Africans Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon) and Yoane Wissa (DR Congo).

Forward Mbeumo has been ruled out of Afcon with injury, and all three players will be a huge miss to the Premier League club next month.

Onyeka says the trio have discussed the situation.

""It's not going to be easy. But I know the team - they are strong,"" the 25-year-old added.

""When someone leaves, another person is there to take their place.""

Onyeka and Brentford team-mate Yoane Wissa (right) are set to head to Ivory Coast

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has previously criticised the mid-season timing of the tournament, but Onyeka says Bees head coach Thomas Frank has been encouraging and reassuring.

""He's happy for me to represent my country on this big stage. I'm really happy that he's also my supportive coach, letting his players go off to Afcon,"" he said.

Yet adjusting back to the Premier League was ""quite difficult"" for Onyeka after the last Afcon, where Nigeria exited in the last 16.

""When you get back the team is settled, they're playing well,"" he said. ""Getting into the team again takes a long time.

""Mentally a player needs to be strong because it's not easy leaving your team for four weeks and coming back.""

When should Afcon be held?

In 2017 the Confederation of African Football (Caf) decided to move the finals from its traditional January-February slot to June-July, with the 2019 edition in Egypt the first to be held in the European summer.

Yet the 2021 finals were pushed back to January and February 2022, in part to avoid adverse weather conditions in host nation Cameroon and because of disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

That switch triggered criticism from some quarters, which prompted former England striker Ian Wright to defend the tournament.

Jay-Jay Okocha won the Nations Cup with Nigeria in 1994 and says the timing of Afcon can have a big impact on players amid congested calendars.

""They've made it so difficult for African players by playing in January or starting the season and winter break very, very early,"" Okocha told the BBC World Service.

""If they can move the World Cup to December because of the heat to suit the nations that are participating, why can't they do something about the Nations Cup, and work together so that it will not affect anybody?

""I know a lot of coaches that refuse to sign African players because of the January (Afcon) window, but they will sign Brazilians who go to play in the Copa America in the summer. It's not fair.""

Conflicted supporters

Issahaku Abdul-Mumen (far left), the president of a West Ham fan club in Ghana, has mixed feelings about Mohammed Kudus playing at Afcon

Ghana, like many of the teams who will feature at the Nations Cup, have a host of star names playing at some of Europe's top clubs.

Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey, West Ham's Mohammed Kudus and Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew are among those who will leave their respective Premier League sides to feature in Ivory Coast.

Issahaku Abdul-Mumen, president of Ghanaian Hammers, a West Ham fan club, feels ""overwhelmed and sad"" by the conflict of emotions surrounding countryman Kudus leaving east London mid-season.

""Without Kudus, Ghana may not go far. But Kudus plays in every West Ham game now,"" Abdul told BBC Sport Africa from Ghana.

""Kudus joining West Ham was one of the best days of my life. He is one of the best exports from Africa.

""I'm a big fan of Afcon - Afcon is in me. I'm an African and this is for us. It was formed by our founding fathers.

""Kudus leaving [West Ham] will be a very, very, very bad time for us. But I'm trying to see that we can cope and we will try as much as possible to see life without Kudus.

""It's a sad time for me as a West Ham fan but as a Ghana fan I'll be happy.""

The situation facing club managers

Mohammed Kudus (left) has impressed for West Ham in recent weeks, celebrating his goals by sitting on advertising boards

If Hammers fans are worried about losing Kudus, they are not alone.

West Ham boss David Moyes says his side will ""hugely miss"" the 23-year-old forward, who has impressed with his all-round play.

""He's a really good boy to work with and obviously his goals and assists are the things that are standing out,"" Moyes said.

""It is a huge blow [to lose him] because he scores goals and makes goals. We're going to have to find other ways.""

Yet Kudus' national manager, Black Stars coach Chris Hughton, believes the club versus country row is a thing of the past.

He says coaches across Europe are now more prepared when their players leave for the tournament, and that Afcon is no longer a reason not to sign African stars.

""Most clubs and head coaches now accept that when they take an African player there's a chance that they will lose him for a period during the African Cup of Nations,"" the 65-year-old said.

""So it [the club vs country row] is one very much of the past. I think the modern club and modern technical staff accept that this is going to happen.""

The 2025 edition of Afcon, which will be held in Morocco, was expected to revert back to dates in June and July - but that will now clash with Fifa's expanded 32-team Club World Cup.

With no obvious solution, the continent's top players could be the subject of another tug of war in 18 month's time.","As the world's top football clubs prepare to lose key players during the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), is the perennial club versus country issue still relevant?
