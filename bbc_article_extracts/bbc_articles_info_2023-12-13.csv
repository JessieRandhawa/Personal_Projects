The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said Israel will continue its war in Gaza until it achieves victory against Hamas. His comments come a day after the UN General Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution demanding a ceasefire.

Relations between Israel and the UN have reached an all-time low and fighting has continued to rage across Gaza as Israeli forces seek to root out Hamas members.

The group's head, Ismail Haniyeh, said he was open to any initiative that could end Israeli aggression but added that there could be no such arrangement that excluded Hamas.

The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has held talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit to Saudi Arabia.

Discussions focussed on the Gaza conflict and other regional issues, including efforts to deter Houthi attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

Democrats have defended President Joe Biden over what they say is 'an extreme political stunt'

The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise its impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Lawmakers voted along party lines to back a resolution that Republicans say will give them more power to gather evidence and enforce legal demands.

Three Republican-led House committees allege bribery and corruption during Mr Biden's tenure as vice-president.

But they have yet to present evidence of wrongdoing, and Mr Biden says his opponents are ""attacking me with lies"".

The lower chamber of Congress, which Republicans control by a slim eight-seat margin, approved the inquiry on Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 221 to 212.

Voting to authorise an inquiry is not the same as voting for impeachment, but it advances the likelihood that the House will eventually seek to impeach Mr Biden.

In a statement, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber ""will not prejudge the investigation's outcome"" but ""the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore"".

A formal impeachment investigation, that leads to a House vote and a Senate trial, could represent a major headache for the president in the midst of an election year.

But, even if the House ultimately opts to impeach the president, the Democrat-controlled Senate is all but certain to acquit him.

""The American people need their leaders in Congress to take action on important priorities for the nation and world,"" Mr Biden said in a statement following the vote.

""Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.""

In an animated debate ahead of the vote, Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole said his colleagues had been left with no choice but to bring the measure.

He said it was a ""sad day for myself, the institution and the American people"" and accused the White House of ""stonewalling"" the impeachment inquiry.

But Democrats expressed irritation over what they have dismissed as ""an extreme political stunt"".

Jamie Raskin of Maryland said the investigation ""isn't a whodunit, it's a what is it"".

""It's like an Agatha Christie novel, where the mystery is - what's the crime?"" he added.

Ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September and said Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.

Republicans have held one hearing related to the inquiry, during which two expert witnesses called by Republicans said there was not yet enough evidence to impeach the president.

The oversight committee claims the Biden family and its business associates received more than $24m (Â£19m) from foreign sources in China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2019.

Committee chairman James Comer has alleged that Mr Biden's relatives - in particular his son, Hunter - sold access to the then-vice-president and influence-peddled off ""the Biden brand"".

He has further alleged that the president ""spoke, dined, and developed relationships with"" his son's business partners.

Watch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'

Following Wednesday's vote, Mr Comer told reporters that unanimous Republican backing for the inquiry sent a ""strong message"" to the administration.

""We have a simple question that a majority of Americans have - what did the Biden family do to get millions?"" he said.

Before and during his presidency, Mr Biden has said that he never talked business with Hunter Biden or his associates and that his son made no money off unethical overseas ventures.

The White House has also pushed back on the claim it is refusing to co-operate and criticised the inquiry on Wednesday as an abuse of power by House Republicans.

Hunter Biden has long been viewed by Republicans as the greatest political liability for his father.

If they are able to link his business dealings and personal conduct to the president, and perhaps even if they are not, it has the potential to damage the elder Mr Biden's standing with American voters.

As Mr Biden, 81, gears up for re-election, he is likely to face off against Donald Trump, 77, a twice-impeached former president and the current Republican frontrunner, in the November 2024 general election.","US House votes to authorise Biden impeachment inquiryBy Bernd Debusmann Jr on Capitol Hill, Sam Cabral & Anthony Zurcher BBC News, WashingtonGetty ImagesDemocrats have defended President Joe Biden over what they say is 'an extreme political stunt'The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise its impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Bridget Ziegler has been a member of the Sarasota County School Board since 2014

A Florida school board is demanding the resignation of one of its members, whose husband, the Republican Party state chairman, is being investigated for sexual assault.

The Sarasota County School Board voted 4-1 for a resolution requesting that Bridget Ziegler step down.

Her husband, Christian Ziegler, is facing accusations of rape.

No charges have been filed against him, and through his lawyer Mr Ziegler has denied the allegations.

The vote on Tuesday to remove Ms Zeigler was brought by Chair Karen Rose, who said in an email that she was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the accusations and believed media scrutiny of the couple ""would cause irreparably harmful distractions"".

Ms Ziegler, co-founder of the conservative Moms for Liberty group, was the sole vote against the resolution. She also did not indicate that she would resign from the board, where she has served for nearly a decade.

In Florida, the governor is the only person who can fire school board members.

The alleged assault occurred on 2 October at a home in Sarasota, in south-west Florida, according to a heavily redacted document from police that included several mentions of rape and sexual battery.

An investigation is ongoing.

The influential Republican couple had been involved in a years-long sexual relationship with the woman who filed the police complaint, according to the Florida Trident, which first reported on the accusations.

Citing ""sources close to the investigation,"" the news site, which is run by the non-profit Florida Center for Government Accountability, also reported the alleged attack occurred at the woman's home, when she and Mr Ziegler were alone.

Mr Ziegler's lawyer, Derek Byrd, told the BBC that ""we are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr Ziegler will be completely exonerated"".

Christian Ziegler has denied the sexual assault allegations against him

Mr Ziegler is resisting pressure from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other conservatives to resign from his post as chairman of the state's Republican party, which he has held since February.

""We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench,"" he said.

Along with the accusations of violence, the revelation that Ms Ziegler had a relationship with a woman is deeply troubling to some in the state. Ms Ziegler has backed Mr DeSantis' controversial ""Don't Say Gay"" law.

Democrat critics say the allegations are at odds with the emphasis the couple placed politically on ""family values"".","Bridget Ziegler: Florida school board pushes member to resign amid sexual assault scandalBy Nadine Yousif BBC NewsGetty ImagesBridget Ziegler has been a member of the Sarasota County School Board since 2014A Florida school board is demanding the resignation of one of its members, whose husband, the Republican Party state chairman, is being investigated for sexual assault.

By Kayla Epstein & Holly Honderich BBC News

The top court has agreed to take up a case challenging the commonly used pill

The US Supreme Court will decide whether to restrict access to a commonly used abortion pill.

It will be the most significant US reproductive rights case after the court overturned Roe v Wade, ending a nationwide right to abortion.

The Biden administration had asked the court to overturn a decision to limit access to the drug mifepristone over anti-abortion groups' safety concerns.

The pill has been legal in the US since 2000 and research has shown it is safe.

The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will hear arguments early next year. A ruling is expected next summer, months before the next presidential election.

This current clash over access began in November 2022, when an umbrella group of anti-abortion doctors and activists known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued in Texas. They claimed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had unlawfully approved the drug and alleged the pill was unsafe.

The case puts the court back in the position to decide American reproductive rights, less than two years after overturning Roe v Wade - a landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed abortion access in the US.

Since the court nixed the decades-old decision, nearly two dozen states have moved to ban or restrict abortion procedures. Other states have moved to expand access by adding legal safeguards.

More recently, that battle over abortion has centred on medication abortions, now the most common method of ending pregnancies in the US, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research group.

The two drug-regimen was approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy by the FDA in 2000. When used, a patient is first given mifepristone to induce an abortion and then misoprostol to empty the uterus.

Since 2016, the FDA has further eased access to the drug. The agency has allowed doctors to meet patients via telemedicine and prescriptions to be sent by mail.

Over its two decades of use, the FDA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and other mainstream medical organisations have maintained that both drugs are safe.

Abortion advocates have long championed medication abortion as a less expensive and less invasive method of ending pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups have countered with claims that abortion pills - cast as ""chemical abortion"" - are ineffective and dangerous.

In April, Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has shared anti-abortion views publicly, sided with those suing and imposed a nationwide ban on mifepristone. He argued the FDA had erred in its scientific assessment of the drug and violated federal rules that allow some drugs to be approved more quickly.

An appeals court later allowed the drug to remain on the market with some restrictions. The Supreme Court then paused the rulings while the case played out.

The justices said on Wednesday they would decide whether to keep recent restrictions implemented by the lower courts. The Supreme Court's ruling could bring back earlier rules, requiring patients to visit a doctor's office for a prescription and to pick up the drug in person.

The Supreme Court declined to reconsider mifepristone's FDA approval, however, suggesting the justices are unlikely to completely pull the pill from the market.

The decision could affect abortion access for millions of women, particularly in states where abortion access is severely restricted.

Watch: Abortion pills explained in 60 seconds

Nancy Northup, the president of pro-choice group Center for Reproductive Rights applauded the court's review of the ""erroneous"" restrictions on mifepristone.

""Abortion pills have been used safely in the US for more than 20 years, and they are more important than ever in this post-Roe landscape. That is precisely why the anti-abortion movement is attacking them,"" she said in a statement.

Some anti-abortion groups also welcomed the court's decision, alleging the case would illuminate the dangers of abortion pills.

In a statement, policy director of anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America Katie Daniel told the BBC that the FDA ""has misled the American people with its repeated claims that the abortion pill regimen is 'safe and effective'"". She blasted the agency for allowing telemedicine and mailed prescriptions.

US studies say medication abortion is effective at ending pregnancy about 95% of the time and there is less than 1% chance of further medical follow-up.

Deaths associated with mifepristone since its approval are fewer than those linked to common antibiotics used to treat bronchitis, sore throats, and other bacterial infections.

The court's decision could have major implications for other FDA-approved drugs as well, Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said.","US Supreme Court to consider abortion pill caseBy Kayla Epstein & Holly Honderich BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe top court has agreed to take up a case challenging the commonly used pillThe US Supreme Court will decide whether to restrict access to a commonly used abortion pill.

The bald eagle was once considered endangered throughout much of the United States, but has made a comeback

Two US men have been charged with illegally killing about 3,600 birds, including bald and golden eagles.

Simon Paul and Travis John Branson allegedly shot the birds over several years and sold parts and feathers on the black market.

They were charged with conspiracy, violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and illegal trafficking.

The two men were ordered to appear in court in January.

An indictment publicly released on Wednesday alleges that they killed birds on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana and elsewhere.

The indictment said Mr Branson sent messages bragging about ""committing felonies"" and going ""on a killing spree"", and that the pair sold the birds and their feathers for ""significant sums of cash"".

At one point, the men laid out a deer carcass to attract the birds before shooting them.

The indictment lists 13 separate instances of alleged violations of the Eagle Protection Act, but prosecutors did not specify what other types of birds the men killed or if many were rare or endangered.

Prosecutors declined to give further details when contacted on Wednesday.

Mr Branson, 48, lives in Washington state and Mr Paul, 42, is from a Montana town close to the Flathead Reservation. Neither could be reached for comment on Wednesday and court documents did not list attorneys for the men.

The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States and is depicted on both the currency and the national seal.

It was endangered in many places in the middle of the 20th Century due to hunting, loss of habitat and the use of DDT, an insecticide that makes the birds unable to lay eggs with strong shells. It was banned in 1972.

According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, just 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were known to exist in 1963, but conservation efforts led to a strong comeback and the bird is no longer considered endangered.","Men accused of killing 3,600 birds including eaglesBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe bald eagle was once considered endangered throughout much of the United States, but has made a comebackTwo US men have been charged with illegally killing about 3,600 birds, including bald and golden eagles.

By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent at COP28

Reuters

There's huge relief at an agreement. Will it make an impact?

Once the gavel came down in Dubai, the warm words flowed - but will it really have an impact on climate change?

The agreement reached in this glitzy metropolis for the first time nails the role of fossil fuel emissions in driving up temperatures and outlines a future decline for coal, oil and gas.

In UN terms that is historic, and the biggest step forward on climate since the Paris agreement in 2015.

But by itself, will this deal be enough to save the ""north star"" of this COP - keeping temperatures under 1.5C this century?

Most likely not.

The major element of the deal, the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, is indeed a landmark moment.

But the language is far weaker than many countries desired.

The UAE presidency had included strong text on the idea of a fossil fuel phase out from the start of the meeting.

But in the face of opposition from many, they dropped it from their first attempt at a draft agreement,

Cue fury among progressives and much finger pointing at oil producers.

South Sudan - one of many countries ravaged by the effects of climate change

This wasn't all the fault of countries like Saudi Arabia.

A key factor in softening the text was the attitude of middle-income developing countries who were very uncertain about the much hyped phased out of fossil fuels.

For Nigeria, Uganda, Colombia and others there were complaints that they needed to use revenues from the sale of coal, oil and gas to ensure they could pay for the transition to greener energy.

Colombia complained that by moving away from fossil fuels, credit agencies had downgraded their rating, meaning that international loans to go green would cost them far more.

The final pact now calls on countries to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels specifically for energy systems, but not for plastics, transport or agriculture.

The agreement also has many other elements that will help limit emissions including a new commitment to triple renewables and energy efficiency by 2030.

This will see wind and solar displace some coal, oil and gas.

Another important factor is the requirement for countries to submit stronger carbon cutting plans by 2025.

If China and India put a rapid transition to green energy at the heart of these new commitments, that could make a massive difference to the global effort.

But there is also a recognition of the role of ""transitional fuels"" in the agreement - which is UN code for continuing use of natural gas.

There is also support for the use of carbon capture and storage, a technology that oil producers want to use to continue drilling.

Small island states were also irate that the deal was gavelled through while they weren't in the room.

They see the lack of greater short-term emissions cuts as the key weakness that threatens their way of life.

""We feel you, we see you. And we see that this text might not be enough for you, or your children,"" said German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock.

She said the deal in Dubai is just a starting point - and I think that is an important takeaway.

Observers here believe that this meeting and the next two COPs, in Azerbaijan and Brazil, are part of a package deal that will help the world correct course on climate.

The view is that with the cost of renewables continuing to fall, the pressure on fossil fuels will continue to grow.","Examining COP28's potential impact on climate changeBy Matt McGrath Environment correspondent at COP28ReutersThere's huge relief at an agreement.

By Natalie Sherman Business reporter, New York

The US central bank has signalled it could start cutting interest rates next year if inflation continues to fall.

Forecasts released by the Federal Reserve showed a majority of policymakers expect to cut its key interest rate in 2024.

But on Wednesday the central bank decided to keep rates unchanged again at 5.25%-5.5%, a 22-year high.

Markets surged on signs borrowing costs could be reduced next year, with the Dow Jones closing at a new record high.

The three major indexes in the US ended the day up 1.4%.

The bank has raised rates sharply since March 2022, in a bid to cool the economy and slow price rises, which last year soared at the fastest rate in decades.

""It is far too early to declare victory,"" said bank chairman Jerome Powell. ""There is a lot of uncertainty and we've seen the economy move in surprising directions, so we're just going to need to see further progress.""

But the Fed's confidence is growing.

Projections released after the meeting showed that none of the rate-setting committee members believed they would have to raise rates further in 2024.

Instead, a majority of policymakers now expect to cut rates below 5% next year - a big shift from a few months ago.

""This gives real credence to the view that [the Fed] thinks inflation is under control and believes that policy is producing the right outcome for the economy,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, a London-based asset management firm.

The Fed announcement came ahead of a number of central bank meetings in Europe. The Bank of England, which meets on Thursday, is also expected to hold interest rates again.

In a press conference after the announcement, Mr Powell said he welcomed signs that inflation, the rate at which prices rise, had slowed.

But Mr Powell said the bank remained alert to the risks of rising prices, noting that inflation remained above the 2% rate that the bank wants to see.

While Fed policymakers do not expect any further hikes, Mr Powell said they did not want to take the option off the table.

""If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust,"" he said.

Inflation in the US has already come down significantly since its 9.1% peak in June 2022.

Prices were up 3.1% last month, compared with a year earlier, according to Labor Department figures released this week.

Fed members expect inflation to fall further next year, but do not expect it to return to the 2% target rate until 2026.

By making borrowing more expensive, higher interest rates encourage saving and reduce borrowing for home purchases and business investments, cooling the economy and easing the pressures pushing up prices.

Officials expect the US economy to grow by 1.4% next year, which is significantly slower than this year's pace.","Federal Reserve signals interest rate cuts next yearBy Natalie Sherman Business reporter, New YorkGetty ImagesThe US central bank has signalled it could start cutting interest rates next year if inflation continues to fall.

Families of hostages held by Hamas meet with Biden for the first time in-person

The families of US hostages held by Hamas say they believe President Joe Biden is doing everything he can to secure the release of their loved ones.

The administration is ""completely committed"" to getting them home, one relative said after meeting Mr Biden.

There are believed to be eight Americans still held in Gaza.

The meeting came a day after Mr Biden said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of the enclave.

This was the first in-person meeting family members of US hostages had with the president after a first virtual meeting in October.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer were also in attendance.

After the meeting, thirteen relatives held up photos of their loved ones as they spoke to the press outside the White House.

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of 35-year-old hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said they came away with the feeling that they ""could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration"".

The meeting came as Mr Biden faces scrutiny over his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership, made on Tuesday during a fundraising event.

The president said that while Israel ""has most of the world"" supporting it, ""they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place"".

He also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must ""change"", adding that ""this government in Israel is making it very difficult"".

Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October.

His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"".

On Wednesday, the White House said Mr Biden's remarks ""reflected the reality of global opinion"".

""Our support for Israel is not diminished,"" White House security spokesman John Kirby said at a press conference.

""But we have had concerns and we have expressed those concerns about the prosecution of this military campaign, even while acknowledging that it's Hamas that started this.""

Mr Kirby added: ""It's reflective of our constant efforts to urge the Israelis to be as precise and careful as possible"".

Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 18,600 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war.

Mr Kirby did not go into detail on what Mr Biden meant when he said Mr Netanyahu must ""change"", saying: ""It's not for us to to dictate terms to a foreign sovereign government.""

On Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages.

""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said.

Meanwhile, families of some other Americans detained abroad stood outside the White House on Wednesday as the president hosted relatives of hostages in Gaza.

By Kayla Epstein BBC News

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge that could undo hundreds of charges relating to the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.

On Wednesday, it said its justices would review the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding.

Some 300 people have been charged with that statute for alleged crimes committed during the Capitol riot.

Former President Donald Trump is also charged with that count in the federal investigation being led by Jack Smith.

The top court's eventual decision could upend all of those charges and potentially delay the start of Mr Trump's trial on 4 March.

The man who brought the appeal, Joseph Fischer, says the law has been applied incorrectly against people charged over their involvement in the riot.

Federal prosecutors say Mr Fischer was one of thousands who participated in the attack on Congress to prevent it from carrying out the certification of the 2020 election results.

He claims that the law, which was created in the wake of an accounting scandal in 2002 to prevent corporate malfeasance during trials, has been unreasonably stretched to apply to those charged over the violence.

Lawyers for Mr Fischer say those who stormed the Capitol were not acting ""corruptly"" as the law demands. Instead, they say rioters were protesting what they honestly believed to be a stolen election.

But the justice department has argued that ""official proceeding"" could refer to a proceeding of Congress.

The Supreme Court's decision to hear the matter could have consequences for Special Counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Mr Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

In August, Mr Smith charged the former president with obstruction of an official proceeding and three other federal crimes. Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed he was the victim of a political ""witch hunt"".

Mr Fischer's attorneys' specifically noted the connection in their petition to the court. The case ""presents an important question of federal law affecting hundreds of prosecutions arising from January 6, including the prosecution of former President Donald Trump,"" they wrote.

Earlier, a US District Court judge ruled in favour of Mr Fischer and two others charged in connection to the riot, but a subsequent appeals court voted 2-1 to overturn that ruling.

Tesla is recalling more than two million cars after the US regulator found its driver assistance system, Autopilot, was partly defective.

It follows a two-year investigation into crashes which occurred when the tech was in use.

The recall applies to almost every Tesla sold in the US since the Autopilot feature was launched in 2015.

Tesla, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said it would send a software update ""over the air"" to fix the issue.

The update happens automatically and does not require a visit to a dealership or garage, but is still referred to by the US regulator as a recall.

The UK Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said it was not aware of any safety issues involving Teslas in the UK, noting that cars sold in the UK are not equipped with all of the same features as cars in the US.

""Teslas sold in the UK market are not self-driving and are not approved to do so,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the agency would continue to monitor the situation.

Autopilot is meant to help with steering, acceleration and braking - but, despite the name, the car still requires driver input.

Tesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways.

But the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said a two-year investigation of 956 Tesla crashes found that ""the prominence and scope of the feature's controls may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse"".

""Automated technology holds great promise for improving safety but only when it is deployed responsibly"", the NHTSA wrote, adding it would continue to monitor the software once it was updated.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

According to the recall notice, the company did not concur with the agency's analysis but agreed to add new features to resolve the concerns, including additional checks on turning on the self-driving features.

The recall comes a week after a former Tesla employee told the BBC he believed the technology was not safe.

Lukasz Krupski, speaking after winning the Blueprint Prize which recognises whistleblowers, told the BBC: ""I don't think the hardware is ready and the software is ready"".

""It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments in public roads"", he claimed.

Reacting to the news of the recall Mr Krupski told the BBC it was ""a step in the right direction"" but pointed out it was not just a problem in the US.

""The hardware is the same in all the Teslas in the US, China etc."", he said

Safety metrics

On Tuesday, Tesla defended the safety of Autopilot in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a Washington Post article.

""Safety metrics are emphatically stronger when Autopilot is engaged than when not engaged"" it wrote, pointing to statistics that suggested there were fewer crashes when the system was used.

Jack Stilgoe, associate professor at University College London, who researches autonomous vehicles, said Tesla should have spent more time developing the system in the first place.

""The conventional way of ensuring safety is to check that a car is safe when it leaves the factory"", he told the BBC.

But despite this being the second recall this year affecting Tesla vehicles, Susannah Streeter of investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said her assessment was that it should not check the carmaker's momentum too greatly:

""This recall of 2 million cars on its own is not likely to seriously quash enthusiasm. The share price has dropped back slightly, but it doesn't look like it'll be hit by a bad bout of skidding.

""After all, recalls in the car industry are far from unusual and the group also has the financial ability to invest in fixes"", she added.

Tesla has heavily promoted the technology in its cars and says remaining at the cutting edge of self-driving is key to its future growth.

Goldman Sachs analysts estimated this month that Tesla's most advanced Autopilot offering, full self driving, could end up generating more than $50bn a year in revenue by 2030, up from $1bn-$3bn presently.

In the US, the full-self driving package costs $12,000, or a $199 monthly subscription fee.

""Autonomy is really where it's at,"" Mr Musk told investors this summer.

Additional alerts

Critics have said Tesla has misled customers about its software's capabilities, contributing to risks.

The carmaker is facing other government investigations, as well as a number of lawsuits in the US in relation to crashes involving the software.

But a jury in one of the first cases to go to trial found that Tesla's autopilot technology was not to blame.

The new controls that Tesla has agreed to do should help limit drivers from using Autopilot unsafely, said Professor Missy Cummings, director of the Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University.

But she added that there was ""an opportunity missed"" for regulators to require Tesla to make Autopilot features unavailable in places where it is not supposed to be used.

The recall centres on a part of Autopilot called Autosteer.

Autosteer helps keep a car in the correct lane in conjunction with ""traffic-aware cruise control"" which matches the speed of the car to that of the surrounding traffic.

The driver is expected to have their hands on wheel and be ready to take over from the assistive system when required.

When Autosteer is on, systems in the car monitor that the driver is paying attention. If it detects the driver isn't there are warning alerts. There are also alerts if the driver tries to use Autosteer in inappropriate circumstances.","Elon Musk's Tesla recalls two million cars in US over Autopilot defectBy Tom Gerken & Chris Vallance Technology reportersAlamyTesla is recalling more than two million cars after the US regulator found its driver assistance system, Autopilot, was partly defective.

By Kayla Epstein BBC News

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge that could undo hundreds of charges relating to the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.

On Wednesday, it said its justices would review the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding.

Some 300 people have been charged with that statute for alleged crimes committed during the Capitol riot.

Former President Donald Trump is also charged with that count in the federal investigation being led by Jack Smith.

The top court's eventual decision could upend all of those charges and potentially delay the start of Mr Trump's trial on 4 March.

The man who brought the appeal, Joseph Fischer, says the law has been applied incorrectly against people charged over their involvement in the riot.

Federal prosecutors say Mr Fischer was one of thousands who participated in the attack on Congress to prevent it from carrying out the certification of the 2020 election results.

He claims that the law, which was created in the wake of an accounting scandal in 2002 to prevent corporate malfeasance during trials, has been unreasonably stretched to apply to those charged over the violence.

Lawyers for Mr Fischer say those who stormed the Capitol were not acting ""corruptly"" as the law demands. Instead, they say rioters were protesting what they honestly believed to be a stolen election.

But the justice department has argued that ""official proceeding"" could refer to a proceeding of Congress.

The Supreme Court's decision to hear the matter could have consequences for Special Counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Mr Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

In August, Mr Smith charged the former president with obstruction of an official proceeding and three other federal crimes. Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed he was the victim of a political ""witch hunt"".

Mr Fischer's attorneys' specifically noted the connection in their petition to the court. The case ""presents an important question of federal law affecting hundreds of prosecutions arising from January 6, including the prosecution of former President Donald Trump,"" they wrote.

Earlier, a US District Court judge ruled in favour of Mr Fischer and two others charged in connection to the riot, but a subsequent appeals court voted 2-1 to overturn that ruling.

Appellate Judge Florence Pan wrote that the Justice Department's ""broad interpretation of the statuteâ¦is unambiguous and natural"".

Her colleague, Judge Gregory Katsas, dissented, writing the government was ""mistaken"" and that its interpretation ""hard to reconcile"" with the history of the statute.

By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Madeline Halpert BBC News, on Capitol Hill and in New York

Watch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'

Hunter Biden has called an impeachment probe into his father ""shameless,"" as he refused to testify at a private hearing with Republican lawmakers.

The president's son was subpoenaed to appear for closed-door testimony.

But Wednesday morning, he reiterated that he would only answer to Republicans at a public hearing.

It came as the Republican controlled House prepared to vote on formalising the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden later on Wednesday.

House Republicans allege that the president knew of, and benefited from, improper business dealings on the part of his son.

Hunter Biden was initially asked to testify on Wednesday morning, but after giving brief remarks near the Capitol, he got into his car and drove away.

He took aim at House Republicans for what he called an ""absurd"" investigation into his father, which he said was based on ""distortions, manipulated evidence and lies"".

""In the depths of my addiction, I was extremely irresponsible with my finances. But to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond absurd. It's shameless,"" he said.

""There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business, because it did not happen,"" he added.

Rep James Comer - one of the leaders of the impeachment proceedings - said later on Wednesday that Republicans would initiate contempt of Congress proceedings against Mr Biden.

And he defended the Republicans' desire for a private hearing, insisting it was part of ""standard investigative"" proceedings used by the House.

Republicans have led a months-long investigation into the president that has yet to uncover any concrete evidence of misconduct.

The inquiry has centred in part around Hunter Biden, who also faces federal tax and gun charges. He has pleaded not guilty. The impeachment probe has focused on his work for companies overseas, including in Ukraine and China.

House Republicans have also alleged that the US Justice Department ""impeded, delayed, and obstructed"" an ongoing multi-year criminal probe into the president's son.

Since launching the inquiry, the three Republican committees leading the investigation have spoken with several Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service officials and have obtained thousands of pages of documents.

Speaking outside on a grass patch with the Capitol dome clearly visible over his shoulder, Hunter Biden claimed House Republicans had lied, invaded his privacy and attacked his wife, children and friends.

""They have taken the light of my dad's love for me and presented it as darkness. They have no shame,"" he told reporters.

He also claimed Republicans did ""not want an open process"" where their ""baseless"" inquiry would be revealed to the American public.

""All we want is the facts,"" Mr Jordan told reporters. ""They should have been here today.""

House lawmakers are expected to vote on formalising the impeachment inquiry into President Biden on Wednesday evening. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed the impeachment vote would occur in a post on X.

""The facts don't lie,"" he wrote in the post. ""It's time to get the American people answers.""

House Republican leaders have expressed confidence that they have the votes necessary to formalise the impeachment inquiry, despite an extremely narrow majority in the chamber in which they can only afford to lose three votes.

Democrats and even some Republicans have criticised the impeachment investigation, which the White House has called a ""political stunt"" designed to hurt the president's re-election bid.

But it comes amid growing pressure from hardline conservatives to take action against Mr Biden. Ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September claiming Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.

Republicans have held one hearing related to the inquiry, during which an expert witness called by Republicans said there was not yet enough evidence to impeach Mr Biden.

The oversight committee claims the Biden family and its business associates received more than $24m (Â£19m) from foreign sources in China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2019.","Hunter Biden defies Republican subpoena to testify before House panelBy Bernd Debusmann Jr & Madeline Halpert BBC News, on Capitol Hill and in New YorkWatch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'Hunter Biden has called an impeachment probe into his father ""shameless,"" as he refused to testify at a private hearing with Republican lawmakers.

By Charlie Jones and Laura Foster BBC News, East

Susie Verrill

Susie Verrill could not leave her bedroom for five months during her pregnancies due to constant sickness

Scientists say they have discovered why some women become extremely sick during pregnancy, bringing them one step closer to a potential cure.

Babies produce a hormone that can cause severe sickness, known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), according to a study.

Exposure to the GDF15 hormone ahead of pregnancy could be a new treatment.

Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The more sensitive a mother is to this hormone, the sicker she will become.""

He added: ""Knowing this gives us a clue as to how we might prevent this from happening.""

Between one and three in 100 pregnancies are thought to be affected by HG. It can threaten the life of the foetus and many women need intravenous fluids in hospital to prevent dehydration.

Some mothers report being sick up to 50 times a day throughout their pregnancies.

Susie Verrill

Susie Verrill has documented her horrific battle with extreme morning sickness to help raise awareness

Susie Verrill, 35, who is engaged to Olympian Greg Rutherford, said her experience of HG was so traumatic it made her consider a termination.

The mother-of-three, who lives in Woburn Sands, had HG for two out of her three pregnancies and is contacted by women suffering from it every day.

""I had a real sense of an inability to exist, I couldn't be around my family,"" she said. ""I considered not carrying on my pregnancies because it was so terrible and that is really common when you have HG.

""I couldn't breathe without retching and I was stuck in my bedroom for five months both times. You have to make your world very small to survive and Greg became my carer.

""It affects everything and you are just trying to get through each day before the baby is born.""

Susie Verrill

Susie says her partner Greg Rutherford became her carer during two of her pregnancies

The Princess of Wales famously suffered with HG during all three of her pregnancies and was admitted to hospital during her first pregnancy.

Previous studies suggested pregnancy sickness could be related to GDF15 but researchers said the ""full mechanistic understanding"" was ""lacking"".

The new research, published in Nature and involving scientists at the University of Cambridge and researchers in Scotland, the USA and Sri Lanka, found that the degree of sickness was related to the amount of hormone produced in the womb - and prior exposure.

They studied women at the Rosie Maternity Hospital in Cambridge and found those with a genetic variant putting them at a greater risk of HG had lower levels of the hormone, while women with the blood disorder beta thalassemia, which causes very high levels of GDF15 prior to pregnancy, experienced very little nausea or vomiting.

Preventing the hormone from accessing its ""highly specific receptor in the mother's brain"" will ""ultimately form the basis for an effective and safe way of treating this disorder,"" Prof Sir Stephen, director of the Medical Research Council metabolic diseases unit at the University of Cambridge, said.

Vivienne Kumar's pregnancy sickness was so severe that she was sick 10 times an hour

Mother-of-two Vivienne Kumar from Bedford was sick 10 times an hour during her pregnancies and the only time she was not vomiting was while she was asleep.

""It's not just morning sickness, it is debilitating,"" she said. ""Once you go through it you never really recover, it stays with you forever.

""I felt really shut off from the world and like I was in my own bubble. I didn't see the end point. It is really hard to leave the house.

""I was so lucky to have the support of my husband and mum, without them I may not have been as motivated to continue.""

When she became pregnant for a third time she was admitted to hospital for eight days and went on to lose the baby.

""I was under a lot of different medications and I was given steroids which didn't work and unfortunately the baby didn't survive that,"" she added.

Charlotte Howden, chief executive of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, which supports women with HG, said the health issue had been neglected for too long.

She said: ""I'm so grateful for the dedication of the researchers, because this isn't a condition that really ever made the headlines until the now Princess of Wales suffered with it.

""It wasn't an area of research that people were really interested in. It was just morning sickness - why should we care?""","Hyperemesis: Scientists make pregnancy sickness cure breakthroughBy Charlie Jones and Laura Foster BBC News, EastSusie VerrillSusie Verrill could not leave her bedroom for five months during her pregnancies due to constant sicknessScientists say they have discovered why some women become extremely sick during pregnancy, bringing them one step closer to a potential cure.

By Jessica Parker & George Wright BBC News in Kyiv and London

BBC

Russia's strike caused considerable damage, which Kyiv blamed on debris from 10 ballistic missiles it had shot down

Dozens of people have been injured in a wave of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv overnight, authorities say.

Fifty-three people were hurt in the attacks, including six children, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Kindergarten and hospital buildings were reportedly damaged by debris as authorities said 10 Russian ballistic missiles had been shot down.

The strikes happened after President Volodymyr Zelensky left the US.

His plea for Congress to agree more military aid for Ukraine made little progress in winning over reluctant Republicans.

EU leaders will also discuss further aid for Ukraine on Thursday, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""we must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today"".

On Wednesday, the EU said it would unblock â¬10bn in funding for Hungary, in a move criticised as an attempt to persuade Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to loosen his objections to helping Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky promised a response to Wednesday's overnight attack. ""Russia has proven once again that it is a heinous country that fires missiles at night, trying to hit residential areas, kindergartens, and energy facilities during the winter,"" he posted on X.

Wednesday's attack on Kyiv began at around 03:00 (01:00 GMT) - the third Russian missile strike on the capital in the past week.

Although Kyiv has been targeted by Russian drones in recent weeks, cruise missiles were launched on the city for the first time in 79 days on Friday, while ballistic missiles were used on Monday and in the latest attack.

Ukraine's air force said it had shot down all 10 targets flying towards the city, using anti-aircraft missiles.

Kindergarten and hospital buildings were reportedly damaged while fires broke out in the capital

The windows of residential apartment blocks were blown out and parked cars were destroyed due to falling debris. Loud explosions were heard in Kyiv before air raid sirens sounded, because ballistic missiles fly at such a speed that it is hard to detect them in time.

""Ballistics [are] used precisely so that people have no chance to hide in bomb shelters,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on X.

Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff identified the projectiles as Iskander-M ballistic missiles, as well as S-400s: extremely fast missiles intended for air defence, but which have also been used to hit ground targets.

One man, Oleksander, told the BBC that the windows in his apartment were blown out in the middle of the night. He started crying as he recalled seeing his neighbours and their children being taken away by ambulance.

Oleksander saw his neighbours being taken away by an ambulance

Meanwhile, Ukraine's biggest mobile network operator says it hopes to restore operations on Wednesday after what appeared to be the largest cyberattack since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Tuesday's attack on Kyivstar, which has more than half of Ukraine's population as mobile subscribers, has put millions of people in danger of not receiving air raid alerts. A Russian hacking group, which targeted internet providers and Ukrainian websites earlier this year, said it was behind the latest cyberattack.

Queues formed during the day at a shopping centre in Kyiv as people tried to switch mobile phone networks.

Lidia told the BBC that her entire family used Kyivstar and her grandson needed internet access to join school lessons online.

Lidia joined a queue for an alternative Ukrainian network because of the attack on Kiyvstar

The port city of Odesa was also attacked for ""several hours"" by drones overnight, a regional military chief said. Two men were reportedly injured and there was damage to civil infrastructure.

The Ukrainian president arrived in Norway on Wednesday for a previously unannounced visit to discuss support for his country's defences.

He flew there after a trip to the US, where he made a last-ditch effort to win new military aid from Congress before the currently approved amount runs dry.

But hopes that Mr Zelensky could use his powers of persuasion to unlock military aid in Washington DC appear to have fallen flat.

US President Joe Biden warned Republicans that they would give Russia a ""Christmas gift"" if they failed to provide additional military aid to Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky said afterwards that he and Mr Biden had ""just agreed to work on increasing the number of air defence systems in Ukraine, and the terrorist state demonstrated how critical this decision is"".

""Each additional system and missile is vital for Ukraine, our cities, and our people. They are saving lives,"" he added.

Mr Zelensky's push for aid came ahead of a summit of European leaders where Ukraine hopes to be given a start date for talks on joining the EU.

Watch: Zelensky faces political deadlock in Washington

Hungarian PM Viktor Orban reaffirmed his position that the EU should not open accession talks. ""The EU is preparing to make a terrible mistake and we must prevent that even if 26 (members) want to make the mistake,"" Mr Orban told local website Mandiner.

""If we want to give support to Ukraine, a geostrategic signal, then we should, but this is not membership.""

Hungary has repeatedly been at odds with its EU partners over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has watered down sanctions against Russia and last December vetoed a deal to grant Ukraine â¬18bn (Â£15.5bn) in 2023.

The EU has authorised about â¬10.2bn in funding for Hungary ahead of the meeting, saying Budapest had taken measures on the independence of its judiciary. However, it said additional funding would remain blocked without progress on the rule of law.

""Ukraine is not only fighting against the invader, but for Europe, and joining our family will be Ukraine's ultimate victory. And for this, we have a decisive role to play,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament.","Ukraine war: Dozens wounded in Russian missile strikes on KyivBy Jessica Parker & George Wright BBC News in Kyiv and LondonBBCRussia's strike caused considerable damage, which Kyiv blamed on debris from 10 ballistic missiles it had shot downDozens of people have been injured in a wave of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv overnight, authorities say.

The Palestinian teenagers I met who were running from the army there on Tuesday had the sceptical dismissive attitudes of much older men - mocking the Palestinian president and his appeals to the world for protection against Israel's occupation.

Behind them, Israel's armoured bulldozers and military jeeps moved around the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, explosions and gunfire from across the city echoing along the deserted, shuttered streets.

The walls of this city are covered with the pictures of young men killed by Israeli forces - some of them members of armed groups like Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. The posters and the faces are refreshed, year after year.

Six men were killed in the operation here on Tuesday; four of them in a drone strike, witnesses said.

Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands.

But the director of Jenin's hospital, Wissam Bakr, said a chronically ill 13-year-old child also died after being blocked from reaching medical care.

""The persistence of the incursions into Jenin, and the killing of young people - this will make the people more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends,"" he said.

""This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance.""

On 7 October, Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 others hostage. More than 18,400 people are said to have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed.

Here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since the attacks - more than half the total number for the year. Almost all of them have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the United Nations.

Since the Hamas attacks, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - in places like Nablus and Jenin.

""I see it in the voices of people, in the music they play in their cars, from Facebook or social media posts, from my debates with my students,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA).

He told me the attacks were ""a turning point"" for Palestinians, just as they were a shocking turning point for Israelis.

""The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment,"" he told me. ""In the previous 30 years, there were no models, no idols for the new generation; now they see there is something different, a different story is being created.""

Even his 11-year-old nephew, he said, had little respect for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but idolises Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida - ""because he protects us"".

Political scientist Amjad Bushkar predicts a ""real integration"" between Hamas and Fatah

""Palestinian youth had priorities and wish lists about owning a house, or getting a degree,"" explained West Bank political scientist Amjad Bushkar.

""But after 7 October, I think these priorities have totally changed. There are rising voices for full liberation of the homeland through resistance - whether that resistance is peaceful or armed.""

Dr Bushkar told me that he had spent a total of nine years in Israeli jails, and had been a member of Hamas's student wing in the past. Seven members of his family had been arrested since the 7 October attacks, he added.

Hamas members in the West Bank have regularly been targeted by Palestinian security forces - not just Israeli ones - since the group took control of Gaza by force in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections.

But now, Dr Bushkar said, something had changed.

""Both Fatah and Hamas are well aware that they are complementary to each other, and I think we'll see real integration between the two movements.""

""The Palestinian Authority realised that targeting Hamas would not eradicate it because it's an ideological movement rooted within the Palestinian people; and Hamas is fully aware that it cannot establish an independent [Palestinian] state without the help of Fatah.""

There has been a parallel surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas

Some senior figures in the Palestinian administration - though not President Abbas - are now openly talking about the benefits of a united political front.

Earlier this month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Palestinian Authority's preferred outcome of the war in Gaza would be for Hamas to join a unity government led by the PA.

Qossay Hamed, an expert in Hamas at Al-Quds Open University in Ramallah, says the crisis in Gaza could end up strengthening the movement's political wing, at the expense of its military one.

""In any revolutionary movement, there should be a political harvest to [military] actions,"" he said.

""There are so many trends within Hamas. And there are internal clashes. I think there will be more room for the political trend within Hamas, especially after this war, when the whole world will not be tolerant towards them.""

Israel says its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and has ruled out a role for either it or Fatah in Gaza's future government.

""I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who teach terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.

""Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan nor Fatah-stan.""

Some Palestinians privately say the price paid by Gaza for the Hamas attacks is too high.

But others say the group's brutal tactics worked in forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners - and contrast its impact sharply with that of the Palestinian Authority, set up 30 years ago after the Oslo Accords to work with Israel on a future Palestinian State.

An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think-tank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago.

Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation.

By contrast, support for President Abbas had dropped sharply following the Hamas attacks, the survey found, with more than 90% of Palestinians in the West Bank calling for his resignation.

Since the Hamas attacks, said Amjad Bushkar, ""the world and the international community have put the Palestinian cause on its list of priorities.""

Widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, the PA has also been unable to pay its civil servants or police since the Hamas attacks, because the war in Gaza caused a rift over the tax revenues transferred by Israel each month.

While Hamas flags and slogans multiplied here in the wake of each busload of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the PA's president and security forces were conspicuously absent.","The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground.

By Mike Wendling & Barbara Plett Usher BBC News

US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza.

His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership.

Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October.

And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government.

""Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,"" he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington.

""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he said.

Mr Biden, however, added that there was ""no question about the need to take on Hamas"" and Israel had ""every right"" to do so.

The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict.

Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response.

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people.

In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages.

He added that Washington had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"".

""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said.

More on Israel-Gaza war

Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to ""change"" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path.

That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel.

""This is the most conservative government in Israel's history,"" Mr Biden said. ""This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution.""

His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza.

While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a ""gap"" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.","Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing, Biden saysBy Mike Wendling & Barbara Plett Usher BBC NewsGetty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza.

Danielle Waldman was killed in the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival

Danielle Waldman danced the last dance of her young life some time before dawn on 7 October. Soon afterwards she and her friends had to run for their lives, but they never made it home.

There is a record of her final moments - a brief video, recorded on a phone. It gives only a hint of the horrors to come.

The 24-year-old sits in the back seat of a car with two friends - strands of her long curly hair escaping from her grey hoodie. All three are casually dressed. There are fleeting smiles and overlapping voices, and a glimpse of blue wrist bands from the Supernova trance music festival they have just attended.

They are trying to remain calm, but they are being hunted.

Danielle's boyfriend Noam Shai is in front, behind the wheel.

""Want me to drive very, very fast?"" he asks. ""I know how to do that.""

""Correct,"" replies a female passenger. A bearded young man sitting beside Danielle tries to provide reassurance. ""We will be all right,"" he says. ""Everything is ok, right?""

Next, from the front, an urgent demand - ""left, or right?""

Then the video ends.

Minutes later Hamas gunmen riddled the car with bullets. Noam, Danielle, and their friends in the back seat were killed - as were nearly 360 other Israelis who went to dance at the festival in the Negev desert near the Gaza border.

The front seat passenger was taken hostage.

When the sun set on that day, 1,200 Israelis had been slaughtered - either at the festival or in their homes in kibbutzim close to the border. It was the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. The vast majority were civilians.

Since then, Israel has gone to war in Gaza ""to eradicate Hamas"", and Palestinians in turn have been slaughtered.

Almost 18,000 people have been killed at last count - according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza - 7,300 of them children.

In Gaza now, as in Israel after 7 October, parents are burying their children. And for every parent, Palestinian or Israeli, the loss is incomparable.

We meet Danielle's father Eyal in his art-filled office, high above Tel Aviv. He has long been a tech giant - who founded the Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies, and sold it for $6.8bn in 2019.

But now he is simply a father, raw with grief, robbed of his youngest daughter.

""She was an amazing girl,"" he says in a voice laden with love and grief. ""She loved to dance. She loved animals. She loved people. She had many, many friends. She loved to snowboard, to scuba dive, to go on a motorcycle with Noam.""

Watch: Eyal Waldman still has hopes for peace

When he got word that Danielle was missing, he raced back from a trip to Indonesia - getting permission to land in Israel, even though the airspace was closed. Three hours later he went looking for her, tracking her apple watch. It was a journey into a battlefield.

""We were close to an engagement with seven terrorists, creatures, call them what you want,"" he says. ""They had killed three or four soldiers. After that we took three officers in a jeep and went down south.""

He found the bullet-riddled car, but there was no sign of Danielle.

""There was a lot of blood inside the car,"" he says. ""I was hoping she wasn't in the car, or that she was wounded but was able to escape, or was taken hostage.""

Two days later her body was found.

""Everything she touched was with a smile. She never did anything wrong to anyone,"" he says, choking back tears. ""She just loved doing good things. And they [Hamas] just murdered her for no reason.""

Despite the brutal killing of his youngest daughter, Eyal Waldman still believes that the Palestinians should have a state - and soon.

""We need to change leadership on both sides. And then I hope in two to four years we'll be able to do peace and build two states for the two people and be able to live together next to each other,"" he says.

But before that, he wants something else.

""Anyone that was responsible, anyone that was associated with what happened on 7 October 2023, will be eliminated. And we will take care of that,"" he says firmly.

""We know exactly who came, who raped, who butchered. We have videos, we have their cell phone numbers. We know who they are. We can eliminate them. And I think we can eliminate Hamas.""

Danielle and Noam were together for six years before they were killed by Hamas gunmen

The former Israeli army officer knows about waging war. He served in an elite unit - the Golani Brigade.

He also knows about building bridges. In the past he opened a design centre in Gaza, donated $360,000 (Â£286,200) to a hospital there, and created jobs for Palestinians both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank.

Does he regret that now?

""No, I don't,"" he replies without hesitation. ""I think we need to do everything we can to make this place the best place to live in.

""And we need to stop killing each other and find a way to live together. I have been working for two-and-half decades trying to make peace.""

Just 10 days before Danielle was killed, she was chatting with her father about the future.

""She said 'you know Dad, I decided I am going to marry Noam,'"" he recalls. ""They were together for six years, and it was an amazing friendship and partnership. They were going to live in the country, raising kids. She wanted many kids and a lot of dogs and horses.""","Eyal Waldman: Israeli tech billionaire hopes for peace despite daughter's killingBy Orla Guerin BBC News, Tel AvivFamily photoDanielle Waldman was killed in the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festivalDanielle Waldman danced the last dance of her young life some time before dawn on 7 October.

Casualties arrived at the hospital in Deir al-Balah after fresh Israeli strikes on central Gaza on Monday

""When he asks me about his family I can't answer. Instead, I take a deep breath and try to avoid the question in a childlike way by changing the subject.""

Moein Abu Rezk is the only surviving relative of his four-year-old nephew, Omar, who is in a critical condition at Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.

Omar had to have his left hand amputated and was left with a large, open wound on his right leg, smaller wounds on his chest and face, and a dislocated jaw following an Israeli air strike that Moein says killed 35 members of his family, including his mother, father and grandmother.

So far, Moein has decided to not tell Omar about their deaths, in case it causes his condition to deteriorate before he can be medically evacuated from Gaza via Egypt, hopefully as part of an initiative by the United Arab Emirates government and the Emirates Red Crescent.

""He needs to be told the information in a specific way so that he doesn't go into shock or go into a state that I can't control,"" Moein told BBC Arabic in a series of voice notes on Sunday night.

""He knows that he hasn't seen any of them, and yet he feels the need to ask: 'Where is mum? Where is grandma? Where did they go?'""

However, it is not guaranteed that an ambulance will transport Omar to the Egyptian border because of the intense fighting and heavy bombardment around what is known as Gaza's Middle Area.

The Israeli military says it has struck more than 22,000 ""terror targets"" across Gaza since the start of the war

Israeli ground forces have already divided Gaza in two, fully encircling Gaza City in the first two months of the war with Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation.

Tanks and troops are now pushing deep into the southern city of Khan Younis. The main highway from Deir al-Balah has been declared a ""battlefield"", leaving people in the Middle Area with only one supposedly safe evacuation route along the Mediterranean coast.

Many Palestinians living in the north of Gaza sought refuge in the Middle Area after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate their homes and move south of the Wadi Gaza river two months ago.

That order came at the start of the war triggered by a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage.

Since then, more than18,200 people have been killed in Gaza according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Omar is among the more than 49,000 other people so far reported injured.

The Israeli military says its forces are operating to eliminate terrorists, locate weaponry and destroy terrorist infrastructure, and that more than 22,000 targets have been struck since the start of the war.

MOEIN ABU REZK

Moein Abu Rezk hopes his nephew Omar can be evacuated abroad so he can receive the specialist treatment he needs

Moein told BBC Arabic that Omar and his family had been visiting his grandmother's house in Nuseirat camp, just to the north of Deir al-Balah, when it was bombed without any prior warning from the Israeli military.

""We have never seen missiles like that before. The missile falls and destroys the whole residential area around it,"" he recalled.

""Luckily, the house had an opening through which [Omar] fell. But his left arm was [so badly] injured that it had to be amputated immediately.

""[On Saturday], he lost about three units of blood and his haemoglobin [concentration] fell from 9.5 to 7.4, so he had to be transferred to surgery for a blood transfer.""

Moein said the situation at the hospital was so bad that doctors could not find a bed for Omar despite the severity of his injuries, forcing him to wait in a corridor while doctors and nurses treated him as best as they could.

""All medical equipment and tools are so limited to the extent that the we have to deal with the situation in a more practical rather than a healthy way.

""There are no painkillers so we have to joke around and try to make him laugh in order to calm him.""

Moein conceded that this method only worked some of the time but added: ""We don't have any other option.""

He said he hoped that Omar would be transported next Thursday to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and then taken to a hospital for specialist treatment.

Lena Shakora, her husband and three young sons have so far survived the Israeli bombardment, but she said they were still living a ""nightmare"".

They fled their home in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City and are currently sheltering in a house in an agricultural area outside Deir al-Balah with their relatives.

""I wake up every day remembering that we are at war [and] people are starving. Its torture to be displaced from your house and find no food,"" Lena told BBC Arabic on Sunday night.

""My family and I are sitting with 40 individuals in one room and all the windows are [blown out] because of the bombing. We are basically sitting outdoors... and it is very cold and people are humiliated.""

Lena said her sons had hurt their backs because they were having to carry containers of water. And to make matters worse, the water is not clean because treatment plants and pumps are not working because of a lack of fuel.

The family was also being forced to eat contaminated food because shops were empty and they had not received any aid, she added.

""Our greatest hope is to have flour so that we can bake, and even that we can bake it on [clean] wood.""

""People go around collecting whatever wood they can find. But the bread comes out contaminated because it is cooked on wood from the scene of a bombing,"" she explained.

The UN said on Sunday that it had been unable to distribute outside the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, in recent days because of the intensity of hostilities and restrictions on movement.","Israel Gaza: 'Where is mum?

Months of investigation have yet to uncover evidence of misconduct by Joe Biden

The Republican-led US House of Representatives has formally backed an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Lawmakers voted 221 to 212 - entirely along party lines - on Wednesday to authorise a resolution that accuses the president of bribery, corruption and influence-peddling off his ""brand"".

Months of investigation have yet to uncover any concrete evidence of misconduct by Mr Biden, and the allegations have been panned by Democrats and even some Republicans.

But Republican party leaders have built support for the inquiry by arguing that the administration is ""stonewalling"" and that investigators need more authority to gather evidence.

The White House has condemned the investigation as a ""political stunt"" designed to hurt the president's re-election bid.

Voting to authorise an inquiry is not the same as voting for impeachment, but it advances the likelihood the House will seek to impeach Mr Biden early next year.

The House has ultimately opted to impeach three of the last four times this step was taken.

What is the inquiry about?

Ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September claiming Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.

But at the inquiry's first hearing later that month, two of the party's own expert witnesses told lawmakers they did not believe there was enough evidence to warrant impeachment.

Since then, the House oversight committee has issued a flurry of legal summonses, demanding testimony from several members of the president's family, including his son and his brother.

On Wednesday morning, Hunter Biden defied a congressional subpoena to testify behind closed doors to lawmakers. He told reporters at Capitol Hill he would only give evidence in a public setting and called Republican investigators ""shameless"".

Getty Images

Many of the claims revolve around Hunter Biden's business dealings abroad and his father's alleged involvement in them

Senior Republicans have claimed that the White House is rebuffing their information requests, withholding thousands of documents from the National Archives and blocking key witnesses from testifying.

In a USA Today opinion piece, current House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote that evidence was mounting ""and the pushback from the White House and others must be addressed"".

""We have no choice,"" he said at a Tuesday news conference. ""We have to take the next step. We're not making a political decision. It's not. It's a legal decision.""

Voting to formalise an inquiry places Republicans in ""the strongest legal standing to pursue needed information and enforce subpoenas"", Rules Committee Chairman Tom Cole said in a statement on Tuesday.

Several of his colleagues, including impeachment sceptics, have been careful in arguing that backing an impeachment inquiry does not mean they are impeaching Mr Biden.

But the steps taken this week raise the odds that Mr Biden could be impeached in the House early next year - though he is all but certain to avoid conviction in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

So what are the specific claims the inquiry will likely focus on?

'The Biden brand'

The oversight committee says the Biden family and its business associates received more than $24m (Â£19m) from foreign sources in China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2019.

There is, however, no substantive evidence of any specific payments made to the then-vice-president or that he benefited directly from the payments.

But committee chairman James Comer has argued Hunter and other relatives ""sold"" Mr Biden - who at the time served as Barack Obama's vice-president - as a ""brand"" to reap millions from corrupt business schemes.

He has also said that ""it appears no real services were provided other than access to the Biden network, including Joe Biden himself"".

Last week, the Kentucky Republican released bank records he claimed showed direct payments from Hunter to Joe Biden through a company he owned that received payments from China.

But lawyers for Hunter Biden quickly noted Mr Comer had mischaracterised payments between father and son that were already in the public record and happened almost two years after Mr Biden left office.

""The truth is Hunter's father helped him when he was struggling financially due to his addiction and could not secure credit to finance a truck,"" lead attorney Abbe Lowell said.

""When Hunter was able to, he paid his father back and took over the payments himself.""

Lies about business dealings

The elder Mr Biden has said his son ""has not made money"" in China or elsewhere. He has also repeatedly said he never spoke to his son about his business dealings.

But Republicans say the evidence they've uncovered refutes both those claims.

Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has been accused by the White House of repeatedly mischaracterising evidence during the impeachment hearings

Mr Comer has alleged that the president ""spoke, dined, and developed relationships with"" his son's foreign business targets nearly two dozen times.

It is unclear, however, whether the existence or substance of any of these meetings rises to the level of an impeachable offence.

In August, Devon Archer, an ex-business partner of Hunter Biden, testified to the House that Mr Biden was put on speaker phone with potential business associates ""maybe 20 times"" over the span of 10 years.

But he told lawmakers the phone calls were ""casual conversations"" that never delved into business, contradicting Republican claims of bribes, conflicts of interest or any material involvement by the president in his son's foreign ventures.

Alleged bribery scheme

A key element of the inquiry has been claims Republicans have recently resurfaced after they first emerged in 2019 during former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.

An unverified tip to the FBI claimed Joe Biden pressured Ukraine's government to fire its top prosecutor to halt an investigation into the local Burisma energy firm, where Hunter Biden was on the board.

An FBI document detailing the claim - in which an ex-Burisma CEO says he paid $5m to both Joe and Hunter Biden - was obtained and released by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley this July.

The justice department had investigated the claim for eight months during the Trump administration, but ultimately abandoned its probe due to ""insufficient evidence"".

The former executive, Mykola Zlochevsky, also later rebutted the claim, according to a transcript of an interview released by Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin.

He said he had had no contact with Joe Biden or any of his staff members and that Mr Biden had never helped him or the company while serving as vice-president,

In his testimony, Mr Archer too said that he was unaware of any such payments.

Preferential treatment of Hunter Biden

House Republicans have alleged that the justice department ""impeded, delayed, and obstructed"" an ongoing multi-year criminal investigation into Hunter Biden.

This appears to have been confirmed in part by testimony from two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whistleblowers, who said the government was ""slow-walking"" and blocking investigative steps.

The department has denied these claims. Other witnesses called by Republicans in July testified that neither President Biden nor Attorney General Merrick Garland interfered in the investigation.

But Republicans, who have claimed a broad ""weaponisation"" of the justice system under President Biden, have sought to contrast ongoing efforts to prosecute former President Trump with what they said was leniency toward the president's son.

They pointed to a ""sweetheart deal"" reached between Hunter Biden and prosecutors earlier this year that would have seen him admit to criminal offences and avoid jail time.","What we know about the Biden impeachment inquiryBy Bernd Debusmann Jr and Sam Cabral BBC News, WashingtonGetty ImagesMonths of investigation have yet to uncover evidence of misconduct by Joe BidenThe Republican-led US House of Representatives has formally backed an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
Voting to authorise an inquiry is not the same as voting for impeachment, but it advances the likelihood the House will seek to impeach Mr Biden early next year.
Ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September claiming Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.
Several of his colleagues, including impeachment sceptics, have been careful in arguing that backing an impeachment inquiry does not mean they are impeaching Mr Biden.
He has also said that ""it appears no real services were provided other than access to the Biden network, including Joe Biden himself""."

By Noor Nanji Culture reporter

Netflix

Sofia Boutella stars as mysterious character Kora

Zack Snyder has been a Star Wars fan since he was 11. He even skipped school to go and see the films.

But the US director, who originally pitched his space concept more than a decade ago as a Star Wars film, says he's glad that Disney rejected him.

It meant the film he eventually made for Netflix - Rebel Moon - could be much more creative, he told the BBC.

""Not only did I have more creativity, but also, I designed everything now. The entire universe,"" he explained.

We meet at a hotel in central London. Snyder, the filmmaker behind 300, Man of Steel, and Army of the Dead, had arrived the night before from Mexico City. The night before, he was in Buenos Aires.

He pours himself a cup of tea, and berates himself for over-steeping it.

US director Zack Snyder has a loyal fanbase

Snyder was in the UK to attend the London premiere of Rebel Moon.

It's an epic science-fantasy event decades in the making. In fact, he says he first pitched the idea at college.

Fortunately, his college professor quite liked the idea. But life got in the way, and he says there was never a window to make the film.

He eventually pitched it to Lucasfilm, shortly after the company was sold to Disney in 2012.

When it was turned down, he went on to make two other films instead, Justice League and Army of the Dead.

But he later returned to the idea, and has now finally developed it into his own two-part film, which he hopes is the start of a new fictional universe.

""God willing,"" he says, superstitiously knocking the table.

Rebel Moon - or to give it its full name, Rebel Moon, Part One: A Child of Fire - tells the story of a colony on the edge of the galaxy, which is threatened by the tyrannical Regent Balisarius and his armies.

The protagonist is Kora, a young woman with a mysterious past. She becomes the colony's only hope for survival as she rallies fighters from different worlds to help them put up a defence.

Snyder knows it is inevitable that people will draw parallels to Star Wars.

""You can't move in popular culture on this planet and not run into Star Wars, let alone if you're trying to do something in actual space,"" he says.

But, he adds, Rebel Moon is more informed by ""the movies of that era, say from 1977 to 1985"", than it is specifically by Star Wars.

The movie ""is really sexy and really violent"", Snyder continues, adding: ""It would never be possible in a Star Wars movie.""

The film will be released in limited cinemas before going straight to streaming. But Snyder disagrees that a film of this scale needs to be seen on the big screen.

""I kind of didn't want it to go in the theatres at all,"" he insists.

""I wanted people to have the biggest cinematic experience they could have in their living rooms.""

Netflix

The cast embarked on a strict regime to get themselves fit

Kora is played by Sofia Boutella, an actor and dancer who has also appeared in The Mummy, and Kingsman: The Secret Service.

Starring alongside her is Ed Skrein, who plays the main villain Admiral Atticus Noble, and Charlie Hunnam who plays Kai, a roguish pilot and smuggler.

The entire crew had to follow an extremely strict diet - including high protein, no sugar, no salt, no oil and no dairy - to get into shape for the film's intense fighting scenes.

But Boutella - who has previously danced with Madonna and Rihanna - said she was used to following such regimes.

""I did all sorts of weird diets when I was a dancer,"" she tells the BBC.

""When I was on tour with Madonna we would work out every morning, whether we had a show or not.""

All three stars are full of genuine praise for Snyder.

""We love Zack,"" says Skrein.

""He can tweak you emotionally in the scenes, he's got the macro and the micro, but most importantly he's a lovely geezer.""

""His mind is endless and he gave us something so rich to defend, with characters so interestingly complex and different,"" Boutella adds.

Hunnam said Snyder had surrounded himself with a cast who were ""all serious about exploring the human condition and what we're all doing on this weird little world"", and that those themes went to the core of the film.

But does the world really need another fictional universe?

""I don't know if we need a universe, I think that we need stories,"" said Hunnam. ""We need to be told stories.""

The Snyder cult

Snyder has a huge, and loyal, fanbase.

In 2019, fans launched a massive internet campaign for his version of Justice Film to be released - with the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut trending worldwide. Eventually, Warner Bros Pictures listened to the fans and Snyder was given more money to complete the film.

Meanwhile, Army of Dead became one of the 10 most watched films in Netflix's history.

In 2022, the Oscars had two public votes and Snyder won them both, one for Army of the Dead and one for Justice League.

He even got a mention, somewhat mockingly, in this year's Barbie movie.

After Ryan Gosling's Ken introduces the patriarchy to Barbieland, one of the Barbies, played by Alexandra Shipp, quips: ""It's like I've been in a dream where I was really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League.""

Snyder observes that the Barbie joke was ""an interesting place in popular culture, that I definitely wasn't really trying to reach"".

But he acknowledges his fandom, which has been called ""the Snyder cult"", has played a ""huge role"" in his success to date.

""There would be no Snyder cult or anything without the fans,"" he says.

Snyder - and Netflix - will be hoping those fans turn out in the same numbers for his latest film.","Rebel Moon's Zack Snyder is glad Disney rejected himBy Noor Nanji Culture reporterNetflixSofia Boutella stars as mysterious character KoraZack Snyder has been a Star Wars fan since he was 11.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/67690168,Laura Kenny: Women struggle to get pregnant because of athlete lifestyle,['Author not found'],"Team GB star Laura Kenny speaks about her return to cycling after having a second child.

Great Britain's most successful female Olympian Dame Laura Kenny believes women athletes can struggle to get pregnant because of their lifestyle.

Kenny, 31, won five gold medals and one silver across three Olympic Games at London 2012, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020.

The mum-of-two is targeting a fourth Games in Paris next year.

Kenny says she has had ""many conversations"" with athletes suffering with Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport.

Known as Red-S, the condition occurs when athletes expend more energy in training than they consume through food and drink and one of the key symptoms in women is the absence of periods.

Several sportswomen have spoken about their experience with Red-S, including athletes Anna Boniface, Bobby Clay and Pippa Woolven and mountain bike racer Evie Richards.

""There are females that have struggled and will struggle to get pregnant because of the lifestyle of being an athlete,"" Kenny, who does not have the condition, told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.

""We've all heard of Red-S - being females losing their periods. You're not going to be able to fall pregnant if you haven't got a period.

""It's actually a really unhealthy lifestyle that these females can't have kids and it's actually really sad.

""I've always consistently had a period but the amount of conversations I've heard of people having Red-S.

""Red-S is actually really dangerous... these people are giving up lots of things that really deep down they want.""

Kenny had her first child in 2017 and gave birth to her second child six months ago - but had a miscarriage and then an ectopic pregnancy in between.

What is Red-S?

It is a condition of low energy availability which has a serious impact on long-term health and performance.

It can impact oestrogen levels leading to missed periods.

Of the UK athletes surveyed, 36% have knowingly ignored missed periods in the belief that this is normal for an active person, according to the Female Athlete Health Report 2023 external-link from Project Red-S and Kyniska Advocacy who surveyed 769 people.

Kenny, who believes periods are still a taboo subject among some people, added: ""For me our coach was brilliant, if you were on your period you could openly say as long as you felt comfortable but I do know there are a lot of coaches that I think still struggle with it and even to talk about it - they struggle to say the word.""

'It would be one hell of a comeback'

Laura and Jason Kenny won medals at Tokyo 2020

Kenny, who had her first child Albie in 2017 with fellow Olympian husband Jason, became pregnant after the Tokyo Games but miscarried in November.

Two months later, she suffered an ectopic pregnancy which is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes.

Kenny is eyeing up a return to the track in the new year with hopes of adding to her hoard of medals at the Paris Games.

""I think I realised that when we had the miscarriage and the ectopic, I knew deep down that it would be one hell of a comeback [to return to cycling], obviously delaying it because I still wanted to have another baby,"" Kenny, who gave birth again six months ago, said.

""I knew that time would be short before the next Olympics and it wasn't about this big fairytale it was about what my heart so desperately wanted and it was to have him. I just wanted another one.

""It consumed me for a long time because I felt that sense of one, loss and two, this missing piece.""","Team GB star Laura Kenny speaks about her return to cycling after having a second child.

Laced with darkness but ultimately life-affirming, The Shop Around the Corner taps into our love-hate relationship with Christmas â and should be a staple of festive viewing alongside It's a Wonderful Life.

As the star of It's a Wonderful Life, Jimmy Stewart will always be associated with the Christmas movie genre. Nearly 80 years after it was originally released, the 1946 supernatural fantasy about Stewart's George Bailey being saved from his suicidal thoughts on Christmas Eve by his guardian angel Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) is still and probably forever shall be a festive staple for movie fans.

But if you've watched It's a Wonderful Life umpteen times and would like a different classic Christmas movie to enjoy, there's actually another starring Stewart that's perfectly suited to fill its cinematic shoes.

Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 romantic-comedy The Shop Around the Corner sees Stewart play Alfred Kralik, the top salesman at the Budapest leather goods store Matuschek and Company. After immediately falling out with new employee Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan), their relationship deteriorates even further as they're forced to work alongside each other.

What the pair don't know is that they are actually pen pals, and over the course of the endless stream of letters that they've sent to each other, they have fallen in love. Primarily set in the weeks leading up to Christmas, The Shop Around the Corner is about as elegant as classic Hollywood movies get. ""It's a very charming movie. There's a lot of comedy. It's very simple,"" says Jacqueline Lynch, the author of Christmas in Classic Films. ""But it's not entirely cheery all the way through.""

Much like It's a Wonderful Life, The Shop Around the Corner is laced with a darkness and cynicism, with a story that features meanness, pettiness and miscommunication, that makes it all the more gripping. ""Both films go to dark places and then end on bursts of joy that wouldn't be possible if they hadn't gone to the dark places,"" explains Jeremy Arnold, a film historian and author who wrote Christmas in The Movies: 35 Classics to Celebrate the Season.

In The Shop Around the Corner, the store's owner Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) hires a private detective because he's certain that one of his employees is having an affair with his unseen wife. Matuschek takes out his frustrations on all of his employees, without ever revealing the real reason why. In the film's most dramatic scene, Matuschek even tries to shoot himself.

At the same time, Klara and Alfred's attacks on each other get increasingly pointed, too. She calls him ""a little insignificant clerk"", while at one point she retorts: ""I really wouldn't care to scratch your surface, Mr Kralik, because I know exactly what I'd find. Instead of a heart, a handbag. Instead of a soul, a suitcase. And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter... which doesn't work.""

A darker side to the holidays

The Shop Around the Corner's mixing of comedy, romance, tragedy, and the macabre is particularly heightened because of the film's proximity to Christmas. Each of the characters' vulnerabilities, insecurities and hopes are exposed against the festive fun they're supposed to be experiencing.

""This is one of my favourite subjects at Christmas time,"" says Arnold. ""No matter what our attitude is to Christmas, we all have a love-hate relationship with it. It can inspire great highs, joy, love, togetherness. It can heighten feelings of loneliness, emptiness, wistfulness, alienation, cynicism. Sometimes, we can go through variations of these emotions on a daily basis when it gets closer to Christmas.""

Of course, The Shop Around the Corner is far from the first story or film to have used the Christmas period to transform a negative and unhappy individual into a more compassionate and empathetic version of themselves â I'm looking at you, Ebenezer Scrooge. But Lubitsch makes it all the more potent by how he balances the joy and desperation of his characters, all while using the season and festive imagery to progress them and push the story along.

""Lubitsch fills the frame more and more with holiday visuals and decor â Christmas trees, ornaments, presents, snow, things that we associate with Christmas â as the story gets closer to Christmas,"" says Arnold. ""As the movie moves ahead, it matches how the Stewart and Sullivan characters slowly but steadily get to their happy ending. It's almost as if Christmas time is a catalyst to help turn that hate into love, which is really what the journey is for them.""

As one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood history, Lubitsch found subtle and surprising ways to increase the drama as The Shop Around the Corner gets closer and closer to Christmas. ""Lubitsch was a master at letting the audience figure things out visually,"" explains Arnold.

Lubitsch has a sophisticated style â he makes the audience participate in the storytelling, in the humour and the gags â Jeremy Arnold

The director of Ninotchka, To Be or Not to Be, and Heaven Can Wait was renowned for finding graceful and creative ways to convey plot, motivation and characterisation in a manner that made viewers even more invested in the film. The phrase ""The Lubitsch Touch"" was invented to describe his filmmaking class. As inspiration, legendary writer and director Billy Wilder even had a sign on his wall that asked, ""What would Lubitsch have done?""

""Lubitsch has a sophisticated style,"" explains Arnold. ""He makes the audience participate in the storytelling, in the humour and the gags. You really have to pay attention when you watch a Lubitsch film, because, if you look away from the screen, you're gonna miss a joke or something really important visually that will pay off.""

He used this inventiveness as payoffs to jokes, to create chemistry and tension between Kralik and Novak, and to suddenly unveil pathos and pearls of wisdom. Although The Shop Around the Corner is officially set in Budapest, Lubitsch's approach means that the film has a universality that makes it feels as though it could be unfolding anywhere in the world. And while the supporting cast mostly have European accents, the two leads have American accents.

""I think there's a fairy-tale aspect to it,"" says Lynch. ""Even though it is set in Hungary, we have these American accents. Jimmy Stewart isn't thought of as European in any sense. But he blends perfectly with the other characters. There's a European colourfulness to the supporting cast. Lubitsch brought a European shrug of the shoulders to his stories.""

The German-born filmmaker was attracted to adapt MiklÃ³s LÃ¡szlÃ³'s 1937 Hungarian play Parfumerie because his father had run a similar shop in Berlin when Lubitsch was growing up. ""This was a perfect vehicle for him to recreate his own memories of the experience of the shop. How all the employees quarrel and bicker. That all came from his childhood, his father and the store,"" says Arnold. ""I imagine Lubitsch didn't want to set it in America so he could bring a European flavour to the story and the characters.""

The Shop Around the Corner proved to be so popular with audiences and Hollywood alike that just nine years after it was released, it was remade as the Judy Garland musical In the Good Old Summertime â and most recently it inspired You've Got Mail. The 1998 romcom starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks sees the business rivals falling in love over email rather than letters, and is set entirely in New York.

While undeniably entertaining, You've Got Mail fails to plummet into the desperation of its characters like its predecessor, and even Hanks and Ryan can't quite generate Stewart and Sullavan's spark. ""It just doesn't measure up to The Shop Around the Corner. It has an appealing cast. The story is really amusing. We love Hanks and Ryan. But there's an adult sophistication that is inherent to Lubitsch that is really not quite there,"" believes Arnold.

For Lynch, The Shop Around the Corner and other Christmas movies of that era ""seem to have a lot more depth than modern movies"", which are instead ""very superficial"". She adds, ""They're all about, 'We've got to have the best Christmas ever. It has to be perfect.' Back in the day, they weren't worried about that. They were just coming off the [Great] Depression. You were lucky if you had a meal.""

You get your family where you can find it and you get Christmas where you can find it, too â Jacqueline Lynch

While she's the first to admit that there are certainly commercialised aspects to The Shop Around the Corner â particularly when it comes to the lead characters selling as many products as possible and spending an evening decorating the store â she points to one of the final scenes, where Matuschek and new employee Rudy (Charles Smith) go for dinner because everyone else is busy, as the true message of the film.

""It's about a group of workers in a small store that are like a family. This is Matuschek's family. He's the father figure to them. You get your family where you can find it and you get Christmas where you can find it, too. Sometimes, Christmas doesn't just happen. You have to make it.""

Ultimately, The Shop Around the Corner remains a perfect Christmas watch because of how it blends the complicated feelings that come with the holidays in a candid, unpatronising, and deeply human fashion, while still remaining hopeful. ""It just deals with the holidays in a very interesting, compelling and human way,"" insists Lynch. ""It leaves you with a warm and hopeful feeling of Christmas.""

The Geminids can typically be seen at the same time each year in mid-December

The Geminids meteor shower, famous for its multicoloured streaks of light, will peak on Thursday and Friday.

Visible around the world, they can be seen with the naked eye, though check the weather where you are as it will affect visibility.

In perfect conditions, viewers may spot 100 to 120 meteors per hour.

Nasa calls the Geminids one of the year's ""best and most reliable annual meteor showers"".

Meteor showers are typically caused by a comet, but the Geminids are celestial debris left behind by a rocky asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon.

Meteors occur when the Earth passes through trails of debris from comets or asteroids. As that debris hits our planet's atmosphere, it burns up and creates spectacular streaks of light.

The name Geminids comes from Gemini, the constellation from which these meteors appear to emerge.

The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, says the Geminids are distinctive because of their colours - they can be white, yellow, green, red and blue. It puts this down to the presence of metals like sodium and calcium, adding that this the same effect that is used to make fireworks colourful.

""This meteor shower is just a beautiful night sky event where many shooting stars seem to come from the same area in the sky,"" said Dr Minjae Kim, an astronomy and astrophysics research fellow at the University of Warwick.

You can see meteors anywhere in the sky, so it's a good idea to be in a dark open space where you can see the night sky for the best chance of spotting this spectacular show.

While the display of 'shooting stars' is already underway, in the UK the peak of the meteor shower is expected to start around 19:30 GMT on Thursday, 14 December.

Dr Kim suggested downloading a stargazing app to help you know where to look.

""If you can find the Gemini constellation first, it's a piece of cake to see the meteor shower,"" he says.

Other tips from Dr Kim include giving your eyes time to adjust to to the dark, and taking a friend along - that way you can keep your eyes on different parts of the sky.","Geminids meteor shower to streak across night skyBy Maddie Molloy BBC News Climate & ScienceGetty ImagesThe Geminids can typically be seen at the same time each year in mid-DecemberThe Geminids meteor shower, famous for its multicoloured streaks of light, will peak on Thursday and Friday.

The Chinese University of Hong Kong at the height of the 2019 protests, symbolised by the umbrella

""There is no 'red line',"" in Hong Kong any more, says a 30-something humanities professor in the city.

""If they want to come after you, everything can be used as an excuse."" He did not wish to reveal his name because of the repercussions that could follow.

He says his nightmare is being named and attacked by Beijing-backed media, which could cost him his job, or worse, his freedom. That fear has swept through Hong Kong's universities and academic circles, which once attracted top talent. The city was close to the mainland, yet far enough to host progressive classrooms, world-class libraries and archives that allowed academic freedom, even in Chinese studies.

But that is no longer the case, academics and students tell the BBC, many choosing to stay anonymous out of fear. In the academic year 2021/22, more than 360 scholars left Hong Kong's eight public universities. The turnover rate - 7.4% - is the highest since 1997, when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule, according to official data. Foreign student enrolments have dropped by 13% since 2019.

""The free atmosphere that existed is gone and people are worried,"" says Stephan Ortmann, a political scientist at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University. He says many of his colleagues have left and those that remain are wary - he has heard of teachers who have removed all Hong Kong and China-related material from their courses.

The self-censorship, academics say, began after the National Security Law (NSL) took effect in 2020. The sweeping legislation targets any behaviour deemed secessionist or subversive, allowing authorities to target activists and ordinary citizens alike.

Massive pro-democracy protests engulfed Hong Kong in 2019

Beijing says the law, which it pushed through following massive anti-government protests in 2019, has ushered Hong Kong ""from chaos to governance"". But it has also transformed this once-vibrant city. There used to be protests, big or small, nearly every weekend - but now open displays of dissent are unimaginable. Public libraries have been emptied of books promoting what officials call ""bad ideologies"" and films are censored on national security grounds. Pro-democracy activists were barred from ""patriot-only"" local elections held over the weekend - but the most prominent of them, some of whom are also academics, are either in jail or exile.

'It feels very different'

At the entrance to the sprawling, hilly campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), seven security guards are manning a booth where teachers, students and visitors must identify themselves.

The security checks were introduced in 2021 - the same year that two influential pro-democracy media outlets, Apple Daily and Stand News, and dozens of rights groups and trade unions were shuttered.

""It feels very different,"" says an alumnus who was visiting campus that day.

CUHK was a battleground in 2019, with black-clad protesters and riot police trading petrol bombs, bricks, tear gas and rubber bullets. It bears no signs of dissent now. The democracy wall, which was once filled with pro-democracy posters and post-it notes, has been stripped bare and barricaded. The statue of the Goddess of Democracy, which was erected in memory of the thousands who died in Beijing's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, is gone. It was removed in the early hours of Christmas Eve in 2021.

No-one is allowed to post on the democracy wall at the Chinese University of Hong Kong

""My friends and I definitely feel a sense of helplessness,"" says a CUHK student who didn't want to be identified. ""I chose to study social sciences partly because of the social movementâ¦ I want to learn more and contribute more. But now fewer things can be done.""

He has begun avoiding potentially sensitive courses, such as those on Chinese politics and history. He is also worried that the research papers he writes can be leaked, despite the university's guarantee to protect students' privacy. His anxiety is not unfounded because Hong Kong now has a hotline where people can report others for breaching the NSL.

He is uncertain what future the city he calls home holds for him. He knows friends who quit university a year after enrolling and joined 140,000 other HongKongers to move to the UK on special visas that allow them to live and work there. Others are planning to leave soon, he says.

""Hong Kong was on an upward trajectory to become a centre of academic excellence outside the West,"" says a China expert who left Hong Kong after 2020. ""It is heart-breaking that 20 years of progress was broken down singlehandedly [by the NSL].""

Dr Ortmann, who arrived in 2011, is just as disappointed about Hong Kong losing its status as a centre for scholarship on China: ""It provided unparalleled access to many of the sources. It has definitely become less important as access to many sources has disappeared.""

Even being expert on China makes you a target, he says. ""A colleague of mine, who is a China scholar, was kept at the border for about four hours, when he entered Hong Kong from mainland China.""

""They didn't like us for a long time, but they made a move against us after 2019,"" says a humanities scholar who left the city two years ago, after he was denied tenure - a permanent job in academia - despite recommendations from various peers.

Job applications from professors and scholars overseas have dried up, says one social sciences teacher, adding that even hiring research assistants has become difficult.

Few students of humanities or social sciences in Hong Kong are now enrolling in PhDs, and the chances that those who do will finish the programme are diminishing.

'What can I teach?'

Historian Rowena He first arrived in Hong Kong in July 2019 in the early months of the protests. She knew it could be risky but she took the chance.

Hong Kong was a beacon for the Guangzhou-born scholar of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. She grew up in Canada on Hong Kong dramas, and watched the city's journalists report on what happened in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Rowena He

This October, she found out her application to renew her Hong Kong visa had been rejected, after a year-long wait. She was fired by her employer, CUHK, days later. Hong Kong's leader John Lee said Prof He's visa was denied as part of a regular process that screened for those who could ""cause security and criminal risks"".

""I just feel sad for the city and the people,"" she says. ""This would have serious, broader implications... people would be asking, 'Can I still continue my academic work in Hong Kong? What can I teach?'""

She says hers has been a rather ""lonely journey"", given public discussion about the student-led protests of 1989, and the bloody crackdown that followed, was forbidden in China. Even the internet carries no trace of that seminal moment.

But this only reinforced her bond with Hong Kong: ""I know, no matter what, every year on 4 June, tens of thousands of people would go to Victoria Park. Together, they hold these candles and tell the world that we are still here, we still care, we still remember.""

Hong Kong, which had always staged the largest candlelight vigil in honour of the 4 June massacre, held the last one in 2019, after which it was banned.

Prof He says she kept ""as low a profile as possible"" at CUHK, but she didn't censor her classes. ""I refused to use 'controversial' or 'sensitive' to describe what I am working on. My basic responsibility is to teach historical truth and universal values."" She dined with her students every week so they could talk about what was happening in the city.

""We were able to support each other even we were living in fear.""

Then in February, the Hong Kong state-owned and Beijing-backed newspaper Wen Wei Po called her an agent of the West.

As an expert on political exile, she thought she knew enough about the experience. ""I thought I understood them very well. When it came to the time that I had to carry just one suitcase with all my clothing and move from one Airbnb to another, I started to feel that I actually did not.""

The warmth and support of HongKongers, at home and abroad, consoled her.","Hong Kong's universities shrivel in Beijingâs gripBy Grace Tsoi BBC World Service, Hong KongGetty ImagesThe Chinese University of Hong Kong at the height of the 2019 protests, symbolised by the umbrella""There is no 'red line',"" in Hong Kong any more, says a 30-something humanities professor in the city.

The lead negotiator for the EMC rebels at the peace talks is Leopoldo DurÃ¡n

Colombia's EMC rebel group has announced it will stop kidnapping people for ransom.

The EMC is the largest offshoot of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and is made up of rebels who refused to lay down their arms when the Farc signed a peace deal in 2016.

The announcement is a boost for the government of Gustavo Petro, which is engaged in peace talks with the EMC.

Ransom kidnappings have been on the rise in Colombia this year.

Among those seized - and later released - was the father of Liverpool footballer Luis DÃ­az.

The kidnapping of Mr DÃ­az Snr and his wife from their home town of Barrancas, in northern Colombia, shone a spotlight on the practice, which several criminal and rebel groups engage in to raise money.

While Tuesday's announcement by the EMC is a victory for President Petro, who says he aims to achieve ""total peace"" in Colombia, kidnappings for ransom are likely to continue.

The National Liberation Army (ELN), the rebel group which seized Luis DÃ­az's parents, is one of several criminal and rebel groups active in Colombia which have so far refused to stop abducting people for money.

The Ombudsman's office said this week that 91 people were still being held hostage across the country.

According to a report released by Colombia's Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation, the number of people kidnapped in the first 10 months of this year was the highest since 2016 - the year when the government signed a peace deal with the Farc.

The EMC - full name Estado Mayor Central (Spanish for Central General Command) - is the largest of the dissident rebel groups to have formed after the 2016 peace deal and has an estimated 3,000 members.

It is most active in the provinces of CaquetÃ¡, Guaviare, Meta and Putumayo.

Negotiations with the EMC have been rocky. In May, President Petro suspended a ceasefire with the rebel group after it had killed four indigenous teenagers who had tried to flee after being forcibly recruited by the group.","Colombian EMC rebel group to stop kidnapping for ransomBy Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter BBC NewsEPAThe lead negotiator for the EMC rebels at the peace talks is Leopoldo DurÃ¡nColombia's EMC rebel group has announced it will stop kidnapping people for ransom.

Thierry Berthet & BBC

Road signs in rural areas of France from Brittany to Burgundy have been turned upside-down

The world has turned topsy-turvy, say angry French farmers, and here are the signs to prove it.

Motorists in rural France have recently been astonished to see thousands of road signs at entrances to towns and villages turned upside-down.

The name-bearing roadside plaques have been unscrewed, flipped, then meticulously screwed back on.

It's a campaign by farmers to draw attention to what they say is their increasingly precarious way of life.

Starting with a protest in the southern Tarn department in November, it has now spread all over the country.

""We were trying to think of a way of denouncing all the contradictory instructions we keep getting,"" said Philippe Bardy, head of the FNSEA farmers' union in the Tarn.

""Where we come from, if someone tells us to do one thing one day and then the opposite the next, we say we're walking on our heads. That's where the idea came from.""

Farmers cite specific grievances such as the increasing cost of farm diesel, late payment of EU subsidies, burgeoning bureaucracy and competition from imports.

But Philippe Bardy adds: ""There is no other profession that suffers such a mental load.

""On one side, the minister asks us to change our practices, to make them more ecological. On the other, he tells us to produce as much as possible so France can achieve food sovereignty.

""On one side, we're being told to do everything to raise the salaries we pay. On the other, we're told to lower our prices because of inflation.""

The farmers' union says its campaign has helped secure a government climbdown on two taxes next year.","Rural France turned upside-down by farmersBy Hugh Schofield BBC News, ParÃ­sThierry Berthet & BBCRoad signs in rural areas of France from Brittany to Burgundy have been turned upside-downThe world has turned topsy-turvy, say angry French farmers, and here are the signs to prove it.

Nick Kyrgios said he is ""tired"" and does not want to play tennis any more as he continues to recover from injury.

The 28-year-old Australian missed all four majors in 2023 because of wrist, knee and foot injuries.

On Saturday, Kyrgios said he will not take part in the Australian Open in January because of injury concerns.

""If it was up to me, I don't really want to play any more to be honest,"" Kyrgios told the On Purpose with Jay Shetty podcast.

""I have to [keep playing]. I've got so much more to give but, for me, I don't feel like playing any more.""

Kyrgios enjoyed the best year of his career in 2022, reaching his first Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon and a career-high of 11 in the world rankings.

But, he withdrew from the Australian Open in January with a knee injury before undergoing surgery for the issue.

He then missed the French Open because of a foot injury and Wimbledon with a wrist ligament problem, which also forced him out of the US Open.

The 2021 Australian Open doubles champion has since had surgery on his wrist but, having dropped out of the world rankings, he said he is ""exhausted"" with his continuing recovery process.

""I'm tired. I have had three surgeries now. I'm only 28 years old, I always wanted to have a family and not be in pain. When I get up, I can't walk without pain. It's a tough gig,"" he said.

Kyrgios has played just one ATP Tour match this year, losing to China's world number 64 Yibing Wu in Stuttgart in June.

""I only want to play for about another one to two years, be at the top, and go down my own terms,"" Kyrgios said.

""I would hate to have another surgery or anything like that. I think I've still got the ability to have a good one to two years and then that's it.

""I think I'll be at peace with everything I've achieved and I'm going to have to just say to everyone out there who wants me to play more, 'you're just going to have to be OK with me not playing any more'.""

He has previously opened up about mental health issues that left him contemplating suicide in 2019.

""That period in 2019 accelerated my exhaustion and almost pushed me to the end of my career a bit earlier.

""If I had a normal career and I flew under the radar, I don't feel I'd feel this way but those couple years really, I think, put a lot on my age,"" he said.

By Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter

Getty Images

Actor Andre Braugher, who has died at the age of 61, was responsible for some of the funniest moments across Brooklyn Nine-Nine's eight seasons.

The US sitcom thrived thanks in large part to the police chief at the centre of it - Captain Raymond Holt provided the show's beating heart.

Braugher portrayed all the different facets of Holt's personality with great skill, resulting in one of the most fully-formed and well-rounded characters on television.

While the actor brought heart and humour, it was arguably his tough exterior and deadpan delivery which most endeared him to the show's legions of loyal fans.

""For me, Captain Holt was the best aspect of that show, bar none,"" says Amon Warmann, contributing editor and columnist at Empire magazine. ""Yes, he could be goofy, like a lot of the characters, but more than anyone else on the show, he brought the gravitas.

""So when it came time for a moment to hit as seriously as it needed to, and there were many moments in Brooklyn Nine-Nine where that was the case, you could always count on Andre Braugher to deliver that and make it connect with audiences.""

Braugher's ability to keep a totally straight face as he was delivering some of the snappiest lines of dialogue was widely praised - but the rare occasions where Captain Holt sprang into life will be some of the best remembered.

One breakout moment came in season four when Holt spends all day making a balloon arch for another character's wedding. After being derided by some of his colleagues who say it isn't a good idea, Holt feels deflated and begins popping the balloons.

But when Rosa, the character getting married, accidentally comes across the arch in his office, she declares it ""magnificent"". As a look of relief and delight spreads across Holt's face, he yells: ""VIN-DI-CA-TION!""

After Braugher's death was announced, this was the scene many viewers shared on social media to remember him.

Captain Holt's often inexpressive face concealed a character of depth and warmth who viewers came to adore.

""Holt was a man without expression but never without feeling"", wrote Entertainment Weekly's Lester Fabiasteven Brathwaite.

""And he was a wonderfully complicated character, a man full of contradictions.""

He added: ""Braugher's deliciously deadpan delivery as Holt often provided some of the funniest moments throughout the show's eight seasons, particularly when juxtaposed with the more cartoonish exploits of his cadre of kooky cops.""

Braugher delivered his lines with precise pronunciation at all times and impeccable grammar. Rather than the term ""whodunnit"", he insisted such a mystery should be referred to as a ""who has done this?"".

In another episode, his team were able to tell he had been kidnapped because he used a contraction when speaking on the phone.

His dry tone was often precisely what made a line funny. His use of the word ""bitch"" in the Halloween heist episode was only in the literal sense - referring to a female dog.

Surrounded by a terrific ensemble cast which riffed off each other brilliantly, the straight-faced Holt regularly found ways to indirectly show his friends and colleagues he cared.

In the show's second season, when Terry is considering leaving the precinct, Captain Holt forces him to stay up all night digitising files - hardly the kind of thing that would change an employee's outlook on their job.

But in fact, Holt's motivation for forcing him to do that was so Terry would, in the process, be forced to look back on memories from the job with his colleagues, making him feel nostalgic and ultimately prompting him to stay.

Although he might not always make his feelings and emotions explicit on the surface, Braugher baked comedy, intellect and heart into the delivery of his lines.

""Andre Braugher had a way of speaking like he loved every weird little clause of a sentence,"" said Vulture's Kathryn Van Arendonk after the actor's death was announced.

""Like somehow his voice and his gravity could hold onto more separate thoughts and rhythms and linguistic turns than most people could ever hold at once. It was such a pleasure to hear him.""

NBC

Braugher had an ability to glide, seemingly effortlessly, between solemnity and levity

But categorising him solely as a comedy actor arguably does him a disservice. He could, Warmann notes, also bring seriousness and authority - notably in moments such as in the final season where Captain Holt is suspending Jake.

""The way that conversation comes across, it's so interesting,"" Warmann says, ""because Brooklyn Nine-Nine at its heart is a comedy show, but because of performers like Andre Braugher, who had a Shakespearean background, any time there's a big speech that needs to be made with gravitas, it could go from comedy and cut right through that and be like 'Oh, this is a moment'.

""It connected, and that's because you've got a performer like Andre Braugher.""

In the scene, Holt delivers a rousing speech as he explains why Jake Peralta must be suspended for five months for witness intimidation.

""Do you know what happens when you refuse to punish cops for their mistakes? When police are treated as a separate class of citizen above the law?"" he asks.

""It breeds a lack of trust in the community, and that lack of trust means people won't help us with our investigations, or testify, or even call us when they're in danger. It makes them more scared of us than of criminals or gangsters. It makes people see us as the enemy, which leads to more confrontation, more distrust.""

Getty Images

Braugher would remain resolutely straight faced regardless of what was going on around him

The fact that Holt's race and sexuality were always present without ever being his whole personality was what many viewers most loved about him.

Being an older, black, gay police officer would have been enough in itself to make Captain Holt a groundbreaking character in the television landscape.

But the fact that he didn't play up to the stereotypes of any of those characteristics made him stand out.

There are several pitfalls when it comes to playing a gay character on TV or film. Play up to stereotypes, and you'll be written off as a caricature. But play down those personality traits and you could be criticised for squandering an opportunity for representation.

But in Braugher's hands, Captain Holt, the minorities he represented, and of course Brooklyn Nine Nine's viewers, were all in safe hands. The actor knew better than anyone how to strike what was a very delicate balance.

""As long as there's no hot pants and singing YMCA then everything's OK,"" Braugher said in a 2018 interview.

""My teenage son said, 'you're playing a gay police captain?' I said 'No, I'm playing a police captain who's gay'. So we have to sit down and understand what that distinction is.

""Typically, when you see gay characters on shows, they're goofballs or caricatures. But this is one more facet of Holt as opposed to being Holt's defining characteristic, so that's what's important to me.""

Getty Images

Captain Holt and his husband Kevin were seen renewing their vows in Brooklyn Nine-Nine's eighth season

It's worth noting, however, that Holt would occasionally lean into gay stereotypes, partly in jest or to make a point.

One episode sees him trying to convince Terry to ride a motorcycle, but Terry doesn't want to risk it because motorcycles are ""death machines"". He suggests Holt does so instead.

""Are you saying my life maters less because I don't conform to society's heteronormative, child-centric ideals,"" asks the self-aware police captain.

""Are you really playing the gay card right now?"" Terry responds. ""Yas, queen,"" says Captain Holt. Rare moments such this showed Holt could have humour and sass where necessary.

Few would dispute that the character was innovative and influential in equal measure. ""Andre himself was a big factor in that,"" says Warmann, ""playing Captain Holt as a person first, with real ambitions, real desires, a real sort of want to make change for the better, and that's the sort of thing that comes across long before they start talking about the gayness or blackness in any explicit manner.

""And they do ultimately do that in various episodes, because that's absolutely a part of who Captain Holt is, but it doesn't define him the way that it might do with how that's been characterised in other shows and other media.""

He concludes: ""That's partly why Captain Holt doesn't just resonate with the black man, or the gay man, but resonates with everybody on some level, because he's a person first. He's played that way and he's written that way, so groundbreaking is the appropriate word.

""I wish more media would study that and take its cue from that, because then I think we'd get better art.""","Andre Braugher: How his deadpan delivery made Captain Holt Brooklyn Nine-Nine's beating heartBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporterGetty ImagesActor Andre Braugher, who has died at the age of 61, was responsible for some of the funniest moments across Brooklyn Nine-Nine's eight seasons.

A Florida school board is demanding the resignation of one of its members, whose husband, the Republican Party state chairman, is being investigated for sexual assault.

The Sarasota County School Board voted 4-1 for a resolution requesting that Bridget Ziegler step down.

Her husband, Christian Ziegler, is facing accusations of rape.

No charges have been filed against him, and through his lawyer Mr Ziegler has denied the allegations.

The vote on Tuesday to remove Ms Zeigler was brought by Chair Karen Rose, who said in an email that she was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the accusations and believed media scrutiny of the couple ""would cause irreparably harmful distractions"".

Ms Ziegler, co-founder of the conservative Moms for Liberty group, was the sole vote against the resolution. She also did not indicate that she would resign from the board, where she has served for nearly a decade.

In Florida, the governor is the only person who can fire school board members.

The alleged assault occurred on 2 October at a home in Sarasota, in south-west Florida, according to a heavily redacted document from police that included several mentions of rape and sexual battery.

An investigation is ongoing.

The influential Republican couple had been involved in a years-long sexual relationship with the woman who filed the police complaint, according to the Florida Trident, which first reported on the accusations.

Citing ""sources close to the investigation,"" the news site, which is run by the non-profit Florida Center for Government Accountability, also reported the alleged attack occurred at the woman's home, when she and Mr Ziegler were alone.

Mr Ziegler's lawyer, Derek Byrd, told the BBC that ""we are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr Ziegler will be completely exonerated"".

Christian Ziegler has denied the sexual assault allegations against him

Mr Ziegler is resisting pressure from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other conservatives to resign from his post as chairman of the state's Republican party, which he has held since February.

""We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench,"" he said.

Along with the accusations of violence, the revelation that Ms Ziegler had a relationship with a woman is deeply troubling to some in the state. Ms Ziegler has backed Mr DeSantis' controversial ""Don't Say Gay"" law.

Democrat critics say the allegations are at odds with the emphasis the couple placed politically on ""family values"".","Bridget Ziegler: Florida school board pushes member to resign amid sexual assault scandalBy Nadine Yousif BBC NewsGetty ImagesBridget Ziegler has been a member of the Sarasota County School Board since 2014A Florida school board is demanding the resignation of one of its members, whose husband, the Republican Party state chairman, is being investigated for sexual assault.

The bald eagle was once considered endangered throughout much of the United States, but has made a comeback

Two US men have been charged with illegally killing about 3,600 birds, including bald and golden eagles.

Simon Paul and Travis John Branson allegedly shot the birds over several years and sold parts and feathers on the black market.

They were charged with conspiracy, violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and illegal trafficking.

The two men were ordered to appear in court in January.

An indictment publicly released on Wednesday alleges that they killed birds on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana and elsewhere.

The indictment said Mr Branson sent messages bragging about ""committing felonies"" and going ""on a killing spree"", and that the pair sold the birds and their feathers for ""significant sums of cash"".

At one point, the men laid out a deer carcass to attract the birds before shooting them.

The indictment lists 13 separate instances of alleged violations of the Eagle Protection Act, but prosecutors did not specify what other types of birds the men killed or if many were rare or endangered.

Prosecutors declined to give further details when contacted on Wednesday.

Mr Branson, 48, lives in Washington state and Mr Paul, 42, is from a Montana town close to the Flathead Reservation. Neither could be reached for comment on Wednesday and court documents did not list attorneys for the men.

The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States and is depicted on both the currency and the national seal.

It was endangered in many places in the middle of the 20th Century due to hunting, loss of habitat and the use of DDT, an insecticide that makes the birds unable to lay eggs with strong shells. It was banned in 1972.

According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, just 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were known to exist in 1963, but conservation efforts led to a strong comeback and the bird is no longer considered endangered.","Men accused of killing 3,600 birds including eaglesBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe bald eagle was once considered endangered throughout much of the United States, but has made a comebackTwo US men have been charged with illegally killing about 3,600 birds, including bald and golden eagles.

Jenin's walls are covered with the pictures of young armed men killed by Israeli forces

Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the occupied West Bank have become more frequent, and more forceful.

The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground.

The Palestinian teenagers I met who were running from the army there on Tuesday had the sceptical dismissive attitudes of much older men - mocking the Palestinian president and his appeals to the world for protection against Israel's occupation.

Behind them, Israel's armoured bulldozers and military jeeps moved around the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, explosions and gunfire from across the city echoing along the deserted, shuttered streets.

The walls of this city are covered with the pictures of young men killed by Israeli forces - some of them members of armed groups like Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. The posters and the faces are refreshed, year after year.

Six men were killed in the operation here on Tuesday; four of them in a drone strike, witnesses said.

Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands.

Smoke rises over houses during an Israeli military raid in Jenin on Tuesday

But the director of Jenin's hospital, Wissam Bakr, said a chronically ill 13-year-old child also died after being blocked from reaching medical care.

""The persistence of the incursions into Jenin, and the killing of young people - this will make the people more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends,"" he said.

""This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance.""

On 7 October, Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 others hostage. More than 18,400 people are said to have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed.

Here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since the attacks - more than half the total number for the year. Almost all of them have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the United Nations.

Since the Hamas attacks, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - in places like Nablus and Jenin.

""I see it in the voices of people, in the music they play in their cars, from Facebook or social media posts, from my debates with my students,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA).

He told me the attacks were ""a turning point"" for Palestinians, just as they were a shocking turning point for Israelis.

""The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment,"" he told me. ""In the previous 30 years, there were no models, no idols for the new generation; now they see there is something different, a different story is being created.""

Even his 11-year-old nephew, he said, had little respect for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but idolises Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida - ""because he protects us"".

Francesco Tosto/BBC

Political scientist Amjad Bushkar predicts a ""real integration"" between Hamas and Fatah

""Palestinian youth had priorities and wish lists about owning a house, or getting a degree,"" explained West Bank political scientist Amjad Bushkar.

""But after 7 October, I think these priorities have totally changed. There are rising voices for full liberation of the homeland through resistance - whether that resistance is peaceful or armed.""

Dr Bushkar told me that he had spent a total of nine years in Israeli jails, and had been a member of Hamas's student wing in the past. Seven members of his family had been arrested since the 7 October attacks, he added.

Hamas members in the West Bank have regularly been targeted by Palestinian security forces - not just Israeli ones - since the group took control of Gaza by force in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections.

But now, Dr Bushkar said, something had changed.

""Both Fatah and Hamas are well aware that they are complementary to each other, and I think we'll see real integration between the two movements.""

""The Palestinian Authority realised that targeting Hamas would not eradicate it because it's an ideological movement rooted within the Palestinian people; and Hamas is fully aware that it cannot establish an independent [Palestinian] state without the help of Fatah.""

Francesco Tosto/BBC

There has been a parallel surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas

Some senior figures in the Palestinian administration - though not President Abbas - are now openly talking about the benefits of a united political front.

Earlier this month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Palestinian Authority's preferred outcome of the war in Gaza would be for Hamas to join a unity government led by the PA.

Qossay Hamed, an expert in Hamas at Al-Quds Open University in Ramallah, says the crisis in Gaza could end up strengthening the movement's political wing, at the expense of its military one.

""In any revolutionary movement, there should be a political harvest to [military] actions,"" he said.

""There are so many trends within Hamas. And there are internal clashes. I think there will be more room for the political trend within Hamas, especially after this war, when the whole world will not be tolerant towards them.""

Israel says its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and has ruled out a role for either it or Fatah in Gaza's future government.

""I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who teach terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.

""Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan nor Fatah-stan.""

Demonstrators carried Hamas flags during a protest against the war in Gaza in the West Bank city of Hebron last Friday

Some Palestinians privately say the price paid by Gaza for the Hamas attacks is too high.

But others say the group's brutal tactics worked in forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners - and contrast its impact sharply with that of the Palestinian Authority, set up 30 years ago after the Oslo Accords to work with Israel on a future Palestinian State.

An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think-tank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago.

Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation.

By contrast, support for President Abbas had dropped sharply following the Hamas attacks, the survey found, with more than 90% of Palestinians in the West Bank calling for his resignation.

Since the Hamas attacks, said Amjad Bushkar, ""the world and the international community have put the Palestinian cause on its list of priorities.""

Widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, the PA has also been unable to pay its civil servants or police since the Hamas attacks, because the war in Gaza caused a rift over the tax revenues transferred by Israel each month.

While Hamas flags and slogans multiplied here in the wake of each busload of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the PA's president and security forces were conspicuously absent.","The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground.

By Bernd Debusmann Jr on Capitol Hill, Sam Cabral & Anthony Zurcher BBC News, Washington

Democrats have defended President Joe Biden over what they say is 'an extreme political stunt'

The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise its impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Lawmakers voted along party lines to back a resolution that Republicans say will give them more power to gather evidence and enforce legal demands.

Three Republican-led House committees allege bribery and corruption during Mr Biden's tenure as vice-president.

But they have yet to present evidence of wrongdoing, and Mr Biden says his opponents are ""attacking me with lies"".

The lower chamber of Congress, which Republicans control by a slim eight-seat margin, approved the inquiry on Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 221 to 212.

Voting to authorise an inquiry is not the same as voting for impeachment, but it advances the likelihood that the House will eventually seek to impeach Mr Biden.

In a statement, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber ""will not prejudge the investigation's outcome"" but ""the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore"".

A formal impeachment investigation, that leads to a House vote and a Senate trial, could represent a major headache for the president in the midst of an election year.

But, even if the House ultimately opts to impeach the president, the Democrat-controlled Senate is all but certain to acquit him.

""The American people need their leaders in Congress to take action on important priorities for the nation and world,"" Mr Biden said in a statement following the vote.

""Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.""

In an animated debate ahead of the vote, Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole said his colleagues had been left with no choice but to bring the measure.

He said it was a ""sad day for myself, the institution and the American people"" and accused the White House of ""stonewalling"" the impeachment inquiry.

But Democrats expressed irritation over what they have dismissed as ""an extreme political stunt"".

Jamie Raskin of Maryland said the investigation ""isn't a whodunit, it's a what is it"".

""It's like an Agatha Christie novel, where the mystery is - what's the crime?"" he added.

Ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September and said Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.

Republicans have held one hearing related to the inquiry, during which two expert witnesses called by Republicans said there was not yet enough evidence to impeach the president.

The oversight committee claims the Biden family and its business associates received more than $24m (Â£19m) from foreign sources in China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2019.

Committee chairman James Comer has alleged that Mr Biden's relatives - in particular his son, Hunter - sold access to the then-vice-president and influence-peddled off ""the Biden brand"".

He has further alleged that the president ""spoke, dined, and developed relationships with"" his son's business partners.

Watch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'

Following Wednesday's vote, Mr Comer told reporters that unanimous Republican backing for the inquiry sent a ""strong message"" to the administration.

""We have a simple question that a majority of Americans have - what did the Biden family do to get millions?"" he said.

Before and during his presidency, Mr Biden has said that he never talked business with Hunter Biden or his associates and that his son made no money off unethical overseas ventures.

The White House has also pushed back on the claim it is refusing to co-operate and criticised the inquiry on Wednesday as an abuse of power by House Republicans.

Hunter Biden has long been viewed by Republicans as the greatest political liability for his father.

If they are able to link his business dealings and personal conduct to the president, and perhaps even if they are not, it has the potential to damage the elder Mr Biden's standing with American voters.

As Mr Biden, 81, gears up for re-election, he is likely to face off against Donald Trump, 77, a twice-impeached former president and the current Republican frontrunner, in the November 2024 general election.","US House votes to authorise Biden impeachment inquiryBy Bernd Debusmann Jr on Capitol Hill, Sam Cabral & Anthony Zurcher BBC News, WashingtonGetty ImagesDemocrats have defended President Joe Biden over what they say is 'an extreme political stunt'The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise its impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

By Jonathan Amos Science correspondent

BBC

Scientists now have good numbers to describe the true scale of the world's biggest iceberg, A23a.

Satellite measurements show the frozen block has a total average thickness of just over 280m (920ft).

Combined with its known area of 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles), this gives a volume of roughly 1,100 cubic km and a mass just below a trillion tonnes.

The iceberg, which calved from the Antarctic coast in 1986, is about to drift beyond the White Continent.

It has reached a critical point in its journey, researchers say, with the next few weeks likely to decide its future trajectory through the Southern Ocean.

BAS/Andrew Meijers

As far as the eye can see: A23a is more than twice the area of Greater London

To put the new thickness data in some context, London skyscraper 22 Bishopsgate is 278m tall - bettered, in the UK, by only the 310m Shard tower.

But A23a is also more than twice the area of Greater London, giving it an overall profile much like that of a credit card.

Getty Images

22 Bishopsgate is the UK's second-tallest skyscraper

The measurements of A23a come from the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 mission.

This veteran spacecraft carries a radar altimeter able to sense how much of a berg's bulk is above the waterline.

Using information about the density of ice, it is then possible to determine how much must be submerged.

""Altimetry satellites like CryoSat-2, which measure the distance to the iceberg surface and to the sea surface, allow us to monitor iceberg thickness from space,"" Dr Anne Braakmann-Folgmann, from the University of TromsÃ¸ - The Arctic University of Norway, told BBC News.

""They also enable us to watch the iceberg thinning as it gets exposed to warmer ocean waters.

""And together with knowledge of the sea-floor topography, we know where an iceberg will ground or when it has thinned enough to be released again.""

When the berg started moving, after 2020, it became increasingly difficult to obtain broad thickness measurements. But assuming an area of 3,900 sq km and an average total thickness of 285m, then A23a has a volume of 1,113 cubic km and a mass of 950 billion tonnes.

Born in a mass breakout of bergs from the Filchner Ice Shelf, in the southern Weddell Sea, A23a was almost immediately stuck in shallow bottom muds to become an ""ice island"" for more than three decades. And the CryoSat data can now explain why.

The berg is not a uniform block - some parts are thicker than others.

CryoSat indicates one section in particular has a very deep keel, which in 2018, had a draft - the submerged portion of an iceberg - of almost 350m.

And it is this section that anchored A23a for so long.

Satellite images even show the surface crevasses that opened directly above the keel as a result of the violent collision with the sea-floor.

BAS/T.Gossman/M.Gascoyne/C.Grey

A23a: Most of an iceberg's bulk sits below the waterline

And in the years that followed, A23a gradually lost mass to eventually free itself and start moving.

""Over the last decade, we have seen a steady 2.5m per year decrease in thickness, which is what you would expect given the water temperatures in the Weddell Sea,"" Dr Andy Ridout, from University College London and the Natural Environment Research Council Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said.

A23a has now reached the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, where there is a convergence of various streams of fast-moving water that turn clockwise around the continent.

How it interacts with these and the westerly winds that dominate in that part of the world will control where the behemoth goes next.

But it is expected take a track called ""iceberg alley"" that points in the direction of the British overseas territory of South Georgia.

Scientists will follow its progress with interest.

Bergs this big have a profound influence on their environment.

""They're responsible for very deep mixing of seawater,"" Prof Mike Meredith, from the British Antarctic Survey, told BBC News.

""They churn ocean waters, bringing nutrients up to the surface, and, of course, they also drop a lot of dust.","A23a: Monster iceberg just shy of a trillion tonnesBy Jonathan Amos Science correspondentBBCScientists now have good numbers to describe the true scale of the world's biggest iceberg, A23a.

Kathleen Folbigg's convictions have been quashed after she spent 20 years in prison

A woman once branded ""Australia's worst mother"" has had her convictions for killing her four children quashed.

The New South Wales Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the evidence originally used to jail Kathleen Folbigg was ""not reliable"".

The 56-year-old was pardoned and freed by the state government in June, after spending 20 years in prison.

Ms Folbigg welcomed the latest news but said proof of her innocence had been ""ignored and dismissed"" for decades.

""The system preferred to blame me rather than accept that sometimes children can and do die suddenly and unexpectedly and heartbreakingly,"" she said outside court on Thursday.

Ms Folbigg's case has been described as one of Australia's greatest miscarriages of justice.

It concerned the deaths of her four infant children Caleb, Patrick, Sarah, and Laura - each of whom died suddenly between 1989 and 1999, aged between 19 days and 18 months. Prosecutors at her trial alleged she had smothered them.

The case relied on circumstantial evidence, using Ms Folbigg's diaries - which were never examined by psychologists or psychiatrists - to paint her as an unstable mother, prone to rage.

In 2003, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for the murders of Sarah, Patrick and Laura, and the manslaughter of Caleb.

It was later downgraded to 30 years on appeal, but Ms Folbigg lost a string of legal challenges that sought to overturn her convictions.

Earlier this year, a landmark inquiry into her case concluded there was reasonable doubt over her guilt, due to scientific findings that her children could have died of natural causes because of incredibly rare gene mutations.

And it was that ""substantial and extensive body"" of new evidence which led to Ms Folbigg being cleared of all charges on Thursday, Chief Justice Andrew Bell said.

Ms Folbigg's legal team confirmed they would now seek compensation on her behalf, but did not say how much.

The case has captured global attention and led to accusations that Australia's legal system is slow to respond to advanced science.

""I am grateful that updated science and genetics has given me answers as to how my children died,"" Ms Folbigg said.

""However, even in 1999, we had legal answers to prove my innocence.","Kathleen Folbigg: Woman jailed over infant deaths has convictions quashedBy Hannah Ritchie BBC News, SydneySuppliedKathleen Folbigg's convictions have been quashed after she spent 20 years in prisonA woman once branded ""Australia's worst mother"" has had her convictions for killing her four children quashed.

By Tom Gerken & Chris Vallance Technology reporters

Alamy

Tesla is recalling more than two million cars after the US regulator found its driver assistance system, Autopilot, was partly defective.

It follows a two-year investigation into crashes which occurred when the tech was in use.

The recall applies to almost every Tesla sold in the US since the Autopilot feature was launched in 2015.

Tesla, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said it would send a software update ""over the air"" to fix the issue.

The update happens automatically and does not require a visit to a dealership or garage, but is still referred to by the US regulator as a recall.

The UK Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said it was not aware of any safety issues involving Teslas in the UK, noting that cars sold in the UK are not equipped with all of the same features as cars in the US.

""Teslas sold in the UK market are not self-driving and are not approved to do so,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the agency would continue to monitor the situation.

Autopilot is meant to help with steering, acceleration and braking - but, despite the name, the car still requires driver input.

Tesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways.

But the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said a two-year investigation of 956 Tesla crashes found that ""the prominence and scope of the feature's controls may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse"".

""Automated technology holds great promise for improving safety but only when it is deployed responsibly"", the NHTSA wrote, adding it would continue to monitor the software once it was updated.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

According to the recall notice, the company did not concur with the agency's analysis but agreed to add new features to resolve the concerns, including additional checks on turning on the self-driving features.

The recall comes a week after a former Tesla employee told the BBC he believed the technology was not safe.

Lukasz Krupski, speaking after winning the Blueprint Prize which recognises whistleblowers, told the BBC: ""I don't think the hardware is ready and the software is ready"".

""It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments in public roads"", he claimed.

Reacting to the news of the recall Mr Krupski told the BBC it was ""a step in the right direction"" but pointed out it was not just a problem in the US.

""The hardware is the same in all the Teslas in the US, China etc."", he said

Safety metrics

On Tuesday, Tesla defended the safety of Autopilot in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a Washington Post article.

""Safety metrics are emphatically stronger when Autopilot is engaged than when not engaged"" it wrote, pointing to statistics that suggested there were fewer crashes when the system was used.

Jack Stilgoe, associate professor at University College London, who researches autonomous vehicles, said Tesla should have spent more time developing the system in the first place.

""The conventional way of ensuring safety is to check that a car is safe when it leaves the factory"", he told the BBC.

But despite this being the second recall this year affecting Tesla vehicles, Susannah Streeter of investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said her assessment was that it should not check the carmaker's momentum too greatly:

""This recall of 2 million cars on its own is not likely to seriously quash enthusiasm. The share price has dropped back slightly, but it doesn't look like it'll be hit by a bad bout of skidding.

""After all, recalls in the car industry are far from unusual and the group also has the financial ability to invest in fixes"", she added.

Tesla has heavily promoted the technology in its cars and says remaining at the cutting edge of self-driving is key to its future growth.

Goldman Sachs analysts estimated this month that Tesla's most advanced Autopilot offering, full self driving, could end up generating more than $50bn a year in revenue by 2030, up from $1bn-$3bn presently.

In the US, the full-self driving package costs $12,000, or a $199 monthly subscription fee.

""Autonomy is really where it's at,"" Mr Musk told investors this summer.

Additional alerts

Critics have said Tesla has misled customers about its software's capabilities, contributing to risks.

The carmaker is facing other government investigations, as well as a number of lawsuits in the US in relation to crashes involving the software.

But a jury in one of the first cases to go to trial found that Tesla's autopilot technology was not to blame.

The new controls that Tesla has agreed to do should help limit drivers from using Autopilot unsafely, said Professor Missy Cummings, director of the Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University.

But she added that there was ""an opportunity missed"" for regulators to require Tesla to make Autopilot features unavailable in places where it is not supposed to be used.

The recall centres on a part of Autopilot called Autosteer.

Autosteer helps keep a car in the correct lane in conjunction with ""traffic-aware cruise control"" which matches the speed of the car to that of the surrounding traffic.

The driver is expected to have their hands on wheel and be ready to take over from the assistive system when required.

When Autosteer is on, systems in the car monitor that the driver is paying attention. If it detects the driver isn't there are warning alerts. There are also alerts if the driver tries to use Autosteer in inappropriate circumstances.","Elon Musk's Tesla recalls two million cars in US over Autopilot defectBy Tom Gerken & Chris Vallance Technology reportersAlamyTesla is recalling more than two million cars after the US regulator found its driver assistance system, Autopilot, was partly defective.

Andre Braugher, the star of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Homicide: Life on the Street, has died aged 61 following a brief illness.

Braugher often portrayed police officers during his career, performing both in dramatic and comedic roles.

He won two Emmy Awards, from a total 11 nominations across his career, for his roles in Homicide and Thief.

Terry Crews, who played Terry Jeffords in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, paid tribute to Braugher's ""irreplaceable talent"".

""I'm honoured to have known you, laughed with you, worked with you and shared eight glorious years watching your irreplaceable talent,"" Crews posted on Instagram.

""This hurts. You left us too soon. You taught me so much. I will be forever grateful for the experience of knowing you. Thank you for your wisdom, your advice, your kindness and your friendship.

""You showed me what a life well lived looks like.""

Born in Chicago, Braugher graduated from Stanford University before attending The Juilliard School for drama.

Braugher may be best remembered for his role as Ray Holt in sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine

He was nominated for 11 Emmy Awards - including four for his role as Captain Raymond Holt in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

He won in 1998 for his role in Homicide: Life on the Street, and in 2006 for his performance in Thief, in which he played the leader of a heist crew.

Braugher's breakthrough came in the 1989 film Glory, where he played a soldier in a black Union regiment in the American civil war.

Directed by Ed Zwick, the film also starred Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington - who won his first Academy Award for his supporting role in the film.

Braugher's television career flourished playing detective Frank Pembleton in the gritty Baltimore police show Homicide: Life on the Street.

He most recently starred in She Said, the biographical drama which saw Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan play the investigative journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein story.

He played Dean Baquet in the film, the New York Times executive editor who oversaw the two reporters.

Braugher won an Emmy in 2006 for outstanding lead actor in a miniseries or movie for his work on Thief

The actor's other film credits include Primal Fear, which saw him star opposite Richard Gere, Salt, with Angelina Jolie, and City of Angels, alongside Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.

But many will remember him best for his role as Captain Ray Holt in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which saw Braugher co-star with Andy Samberg, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Lo Truglio and Melissa Fumero, playing New York police officers in Brooklyn's fictional 99th Precinct.

David Simon, whose non-fiction book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets inspired the show Homocide: Life on the Street, said Braugher's death was ""too damn soon"".

""I've worked with a lot of wonderful actors. I'll never work with one better,"" Simon, who also created The Wire, said on X.

Actor Marc Evan Jackson, who played Braugher's on-screen husband in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, shared a picture of the pair hugging while on set, wearing their wedding rings.

He captioned the post on X: ""O Captain. My Captain.""

Joe Lo Truglio, who played Detective Charles Boyle on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, posted on Instagram about being on set with Braugher.

He wrote: ""What you probably don't know is that Andre could sing, too, and did often at lunch, belting bassy vocals from his dressing room to whatever new music he found. At first, it was odd but then very quickly it made all the sense in the world because the man was so full of song and that's why the world took notice.""

Chelsea Peretti who starred alongside Truglio as Gina Linetti in the show, said that she was ""forever lucky to have gone on such a journey"" with Braugher.

Ryan Case, who directed the US sitcom, posted a thread of her favourite memories of Braugher on X, writing: ""My 'challenge' editing him in the Brooklyn pilot was finding takes where he wasn't smiling. We wanted to save that for the end. He was like a giddy school child doing his first comedy and it was so wonderful.""

""If there weren't men like Andre in this business I probably would've quit it a long time ago. The world is worse without him,"" she added.

Dirk Blocker, another co-star, known for his role as Michael Hitchcock, said: ""Fiercely intelligent, remarkably kind, supportive, generous and possessed a deep and extraordinary talent, and had even more to offer. I am devastated. I love him. The nine years I was able to work with him and to just be in his presence was truly a blessing.""

Television network NBC also paid tribute to Braugher, describing him as ""the actor that others in the profession would always aspire to be"".

Viola Davis, who worked with Braugher for a live staging of Good Times, wrote on Instagram: ""Heart-breaking. You went way too soon. I loved every minute of working with you.""

Speaking to BBC News earlier this year, Homicide writer and producer Tom Fontana praised Braugher's screen presence, charisma and energy.

""I had never seen an actor like that on television,"" said Fontana. ""His rhythms were so unique.""

Braugher's other notable credits include Benjamin O Davis in Tuskegee Airmen, Dr Ben Gideon in Gideon's Crossing - which won him a Golden Globe nomination - and Owen in Men Of A Certain Age, all roles which won him Emmy Award nominations.

Mike Royce, who co-created Men Of A Certain Age, said on X: ""This is impossible for me to process. He was best actor in the world. An incredible human being. An incomprehensible loss.""

According to the Hollywood Reporter, he had been cast as the male lead in a Netflix-backed murder-mystery The Residence, set at the White House.

Braugher died on Monday after a brief illness, his publicist Jennifer Allen told the PA news agency.","Andre Braugher: Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Captain Raymond Holt dies aged 61Watch: Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Andre Braugher in his own wordsAndre Braugher, the star of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Homicide: Life on the Street, has died aged 61 following a brief illness.

Bonmati started all seven of Spain's games at this year's Women's World Cup, scoring three goals and laying on two assists

""Where did this girl come from, where did she come from?""

Around Catalonia, those incredulous words were heard every time Aitana Bonmati took to the pitch.

In the early 2000s - an era when football pitches were often not seen as a place for girls - she defied stereotypes and scepticism from the beginning.

Oscar Gamez was her first coach, guiding her as a seven-year-old girl in a CD Ribes boys' team. He vividly recalls the post-match scenes, when parents from opposing teams would approach him in disbelief.

""She was like a tsunami,"" Gamez told BBC Sport. ""On the pitch, she was a force of nature. It was a sensation to see her play.

""She had an extra thing that the boys didn't have - this effervescence, this character of always wanting and wanting and wanting to goâ¦ that was the main difference.""

Bonmati was not just the only girl on her team; she was the only girl playing for CD Ribes as a whole. One club, with 400 boys and one girl.

""We know how boys can be, and at that time, they discriminated against her for being the only girl,"" Gamez said. ""But I never had to mediate. Aitana had a very strong character and didn't let anyone trample over her.""

Playing on rough pitches, Bonmati would throw herself into tackles, dust herself down and never complain.

Small-town scepticism quickly turned to awe.

Bonmati's story isn't merely one of a girl who played football; it is a saga of mental strength, intensity, and a relentless desire that transcends generations.

From the dirt and grit of Ribes' proving grounds, Bonmati has risen to the pinnacle of women's football, yet the source of her energy and resilience stretches back, far beyond the pitch and even her own birth.

Rosa Bonmati, Aitana's mother, faced a form. And a decision.

It was 1998. She had come to the civil registry to register her daughter's birth.

Spanish tradition, convention and legislation were unanimous. The surname of Rosa's father - Vincent Conca - must be the first of Aitana's two surnames. Bonmati would be retained as a name, but only on official documents. Aitana would be commonly known as Aitana Conca.

Rosa resisted.

With Vincent's full endorsement, she put her own name - Bonmati - before her husband's.

When the bureaucracy wouldn't allow that, Rosa instead registered herself as a single mother, leaving Vincent's details off the form entirely, and giving Aitana only one surname, but an early example of standing up for what she believes in.

Rosa left the registry but refused to let the issue lie. Together with politician Imma Mayol and a team of legal experts, she put forward a proposal to change the law to allow parents to ascribe their children's' surnames in any order.

Bonmati, pictured at the age of seven, grew up in Ribes, a small town 25 miles down the coast from Barcelona

It was passed at the end of 1999, a few months before Aitana's second birthday. Vincent's name was added to Aitana's official documents, but after Rosa's. She became Aitana Bonmati Conca, just as Rosa had always intended.

Vincent, like his wife, is committed to causes.

As well as advocating for family rights, he is a campaigner in the Movement for the Defence of the Land (MDT), a coalition of socialist organisations pushing for the independence of Catalonia and other surrounding regions.

""Rosa has always been a bit more impulsive, while Vincent is a bit more reflective and thoughtful and composed. The blend has given Aitana this way of being"", her aunt Lily Bonmati told BBC Sport.

Aitana's upbringing was a peaceful one.

Nestled on the outskirts of Barcelona, Ribes is a tranquil village of about 30,000 residents.

In this idyllic spot, where the sound of children playing football echoes off the town square's stone buildings, Bonmati thrived.

For her parents, intellectual stimulation was more important than athletic passion.

Both Rosa and Vincent taught Catalan language and literature and the family home resembled a quaint library, with every room adorned with books.

Guided by Rosa, Aitana would piece together puzzles as a toddler, building focus and concentration to go with her natural energy.

By then she had long since been in her own room. Her parents, keen to develop their daughter's independence, had taught her to sleep alone from the tender age of three months.

The love of books is something that has been passed down through the generations, with Bonmati fascinated by philosophy, justice and history.

Her reading includes If This Is A Man and Man's Search for Meaning - Primo Levi and Viktor Frankl's accounts of their incarceration in Nazi-run concentration camps during the Second World War - and Heather Dune Macadam's The Nine Hundred, which details the story of a group of young women who were the first Jews to be taken by official transport to Auschwitz.

Currently, she is engrossed in Open - Andre Agassi's 2009 autobiography - which charts the legendary tennis player's intense childhood and difficulties dealing with fame.

Bonmati had tried swimming and basketball, but it was football that fit best, both for her and her family.

A nine-year-old Bonmati playing football with a cousin

Her mother relished Bonmati's disregard for gender norms, while her father would fashion a ball from aluminium foil and take on his young daughter in high-spirited games in the kitchen.

As her passion developed, Bonmati would wear her Ribes football kit to family gatherings rather than a dress. And in her family, such freedom of expression was encouraged rather than challenged.

Her first coach, Gamez, saw her fearless spirit and drew a comparison with charismatic Barcelona captain Carles Puyol. Starting as a defender, Bonmati's ability to steal the ball and initiate attacks showcased her strength on the pitch.

But as Gamez rotated her from defence to midfield, Bonmati's influence only grew, paving the way for her journey, 40 minutes east, from the serene village of Ribes to the noise and light of FC Barcelona.

Bonmati made her Barcelona first-team debut as an 18-year-old, but took time to nail down a regular place

The move to Barcelona marked a substantial step up in the standard of football. Yet, there was not the same improvement in conditions off the pitch.

After training, Bonmati and her Barcelona youth team-mates would make do with cold showers in makeshift changing rooms.

Gym sessions and tactical video analysis lectures, pivotal to developing their teenage minds and bodies for the professional game, never happened.

And, while their male counterparts had the famed La Masia, Barcelona's female youth players had no similar on-site residential facility to help their training.

Instead, once their three-hour training sessions finished around midnight, Bonmati would watch her team-mates climb into family cars to head back to their distant hometowns, fighting off sleep to study schoolwork as they went.

And they were the lucky ones.

Bonmati used to take public transport every day, first the bus and then the train, to be able to train with Barcelona. This was because her mother suffers from chronic pain condition fibromyalgia and was often unable to drive and her father had not passed his test.

It was a journey of 23 miles and more than an hour each way for Bonmati.

""I was running so as not to miss the train homeâ¦ I even wondered if it was worth all the effort,"" she admitted last year, thinking back to those days.

""She got tired because it was tough,"" her aunt Lily said. ""She was about to quit football in adolescence.""

Aitana was 13 when her mother suggested that, as well as working hard towards her goals, she should also work on herself.

Bonmati started seeing a psychologist, focusing on accepting frustration as a normal part of achievement and the pursuit of excellence.

Some of the exercises that she learned, such as writing down her emotions to help ease their burden on her mind, she still practises today.

Through these testing years, though, Bonmati's love of football never wavered. Former team-mate Carla Rivera vividly recalls Bonmati's relentless pursuit of improvement.

""I recall her being extremely demanding of herself, obsessed with sport and driven to improve,"" Rivera told BBC Sport.

""There were times when she stayed overnight at my place after late training sessions, and after dinner she remained engrossed in football-related content on the internet.""

The obsession did not translate into instant success. When Lluis Cortes was appointed manager of Barcelona in 2019, the 21-year-old Bonmati was a fringe player.

""Aitana is a very ambitious player who always wants to play and be important, and that role was proving to be challenging for her,"" admitted Cortes of Bonmati's bit-part presence in the team.

However, Cortes, who knew the midfielder from working with the Catalan 'national' team, was soon won over by her determination and quality.

""She's a player who gives her all in every training session, and through that she has undoubtedly secured her place in the first team,"" he added.

Bonmati has since emerged as a key player in Barcelona's midfield, winning four successive domestic titles and two Champions Leagues.

Bonmati's importance for club and country increased after Alexia Putellas, her predecessor as the Ballon d'Or winner, suffered a knee ligament injury in 2022.

Bonmati, top, was a key figure in Spain's World Cup win in 2023, picking up the Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player

Bonmati seamlessly stepped into the breach, not only assuming a crucial role in Barcelona and the Spain national team, but also shouldering leadership responsibilities.

""I believe that Aitana did have to step up with Alexia's injury,"" said Cortes. ""She was the player who had to assume that role because we had been preparing her in recent years to be a leader within the team.""

In August 2023, when Spain's Ivana Andres hoisted the Women's World Cup into the night sky in Sydney, Bonmati was on the edge of the celebration image that would appear on front pages around the world.

But, on the pitch and in the aftermath, she was central.

""She is a leader, especially on the field, where she demonstrates it the most. She is considered the brain and nerve of the team,"" Ona Batlle, a team-mate for club and country, told BBC Sport.

Ten years before helping Spain to a World Cup final win over the Lionesses, Bonmati was part of a team that beat England in the semi-finals of the European Under-17 Championships in Burton upon Trent

In the story of women's football, Veronica Boquete, a revered figure and former Spain captain, stands as testament to the national team's resilience against their own football association.

Eight years ago, Boquete skippered Spain in their first World Cup appearance. The outcome - a group-stage exit - was very different from 2023, but the backdrop was depressingly familiar.

In the aftermath of the tournament, Boquete and the rest of the squad demanded the removal of Ignacio Quereda, who had coached the team for 27 years, later accusing him of overseeing a toxic culture.

Quereda resigned in July 2015.

Boquete believes that collective uprising, aimed at reshaping the federation and national team structures, lay the groundwork for subsequent transformations off the pitch and success on it.

""When we started to experience good conditions abroad, we knew how important it was to make this leap in quality,"" Boquete told BBC Sport.

""It was the only thing missing.""

Boquete says Spain's women's team are not seeking identical salaries to men but rather parity in training, travel and technical staff to optimise their competitiveness and maximise their chances of victory.

In August 2023, the ultimate moment of triumph arrived - a team who, a decade before had never even qualified for the Women's World Cup, won the game's greatest prize.

But Spain's sweetest moment was soured by the kiss that former Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales gave forward Jennifer Hermoso as the team went to collect their prize in Sydney.

The image of that kiss, which Hermoso says was non-consensual, circled the globe and started a worldwide debate.

Bonmati was one of 15 players who wrote to the Spanish federation in September 2022 saying that they would not play for the team again until changes were made to a culture and set-up that was damaging to their ""emotional state"" and ""health"".

The Spanish federation made their writing of letters public and backed coach Jorge Vilda instead. Bonmati, Batlle and forward Mariona Caldentey were the only three of the 15 complainants to be included in the squad for Australia and New Zealand 2023.

In the wake of their World Cup victory, Bonmati used her platform when receiving an Uefa award for the best European player to point out the parallels with women everywhere.

""We won the World Cup, but we're not talking a lot about that because of some things I [would] rather not ignore,"" she said on stage in Monaco.

""As a society, we cannot allow the abuse of power in a professional relationship, as well as acts of disrespect.

""I would like to extend my support from my team-mate Jenni to all women going through the same.""

The power of words and the importance of her profile is part of the legacy of Bonmati's upbringing.

Bonmati's haul of individual accolades after a stellar 2023 also includes the prestigious Ballon d'Or, which she won with a share of the vote that has been unprecedented since the introduction of the women's award in 2018

Having won the game's top individual, club and international honours, what is next for Bonmati to aim for?

Batlle insists there are plenty more goals to achieve.

""We no longer think about being world champions; instead, we want to be Olympic champions or secure another victory in the Champions League,"" she said of Spain and Barcelona's next objectives.

Yet Bonmati's greatest legacy may not be in the trophy cabinet. Six years ago, back at her first club of CD Ribes, there was no female team.

Now locals describe Bonmati as the 'godmother' of a club which can boast 180 girls playing across 14 teams. It is a transformation that has been mirrored across the country.

Nine years ago, there were 44,873 registered female football players in Spain. In 2023, the total reached 100,000.

Bonmati still visits her first club a couple of times a year. When she does, there are extraordinary scenes. The girls don't just welcome her; they cry, fight, or even scratch themselves out of pure emotion for a photo.

The football facility in Ribes now bears Bonmati's full, ground-breaking name

Her influence is not only felt in grand stadiums but it resonates deeply at the grassroots, where dreams are nurtured and the level of competition rises with each passing day.

Despite her impact and influence, Bonmati is still true to the quiet, reserved girl who started out on her journey. After she won the Ballon d'Or in October, the family WhatsApp group wasn't flooded with messages and behind-the-scenes selfies from Paris.

""We extended our congratulations, reaffirming our support for her,"" remembered her aunt Lily.

""I also took a moment to reflect on our family, considering the award as a collective recognition of our shared efforts.

""Her response only came a few days later. We understand her reserved demeanour; it's part of who she is and the demands of her profession.""

Bonmati's journey, marked by silent struggles and vocal triumphs, has not always been easy.

""Ambition is all well and good, but behind it comes suffering,"" she said this summer in an interview with El Pais. external-link

For Bonmati, those words are more than a soundbite statement; they belong in an anthem of resilience that has played since the start.","Around Catalonia, those incredulous words were heard every time Aitana Bonmati took to the pitch.

By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Madeline Halpert BBC News, on Capitol Hill and in New York

Watch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'

Hunter Biden has called an impeachment probe into his father ""shameless,"" as he refused to testify at a private hearing with Republican lawmakers.

The president's son was subpoenaed to appear for closed-door testimony.

But Wednesday morning, he reiterated that he would only answer to Republicans at a public hearing.

It came as the Republican controlled House prepared to vote on formalising the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden later on Wednesday.

House Republicans allege that the president knew of, and benefited from, improper business dealings on the part of his son.

Hunter Biden was initially asked to testify on Wednesday morning, but after giving brief remarks near the Capitol, he got into his car and drove away.

He took aim at House Republicans for what he called an ""absurd"" investigation into his father, which he said was based on ""distortions, manipulated evidence and lies"".

""In the depths of my addiction, I was extremely irresponsible with my finances. But to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond absurd. It's shameless,"" he said.

""There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business, because it did not happen,"" he added.

Rep James Comer - one of the leaders of the impeachment proceedings - said later on Wednesday that Republicans would initiate contempt of Congress proceedings against Mr Biden.

And he defended the Republicans' desire for a private hearing, insisting it was part of ""standard investigative"" proceedings used by the House.

Republicans have led a months-long investigation into the president that has yet to uncover any concrete evidence of misconduct.

The inquiry has centred in part around Hunter Biden, who also faces federal tax and gun charges. He has pleaded not guilty. The impeachment probe has focused on his work for companies overseas, including in Ukraine and China.

House Republicans have also alleged that the US Justice Department ""impeded, delayed, and obstructed"" an ongoing multi-year criminal probe into the president's son.

Since launching the inquiry, the three Republican committees leading the investigation have spoken with several Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service officials and have obtained thousands of pages of documents.

Speaking outside on a grass patch with the Capitol dome clearly visible over his shoulder, Hunter Biden claimed House Republicans had lied, invaded his privacy and attacked his wife, children and friends.

""They have taken the light of my dad's love for me and presented it as darkness. They have no shame,"" he told reporters.

He also claimed Republicans did ""not want an open process"" where their ""baseless"" inquiry would be revealed to the American public.

""All we want is the facts,"" Mr Jordan told reporters. ""They should have been here today.""

House lawmakers are expected to vote on formalising the impeachment inquiry into President Biden on Wednesday evening. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed the impeachment vote would occur in a post on X.

""The facts don't lie,"" he wrote in the post. ""It's time to get the American people answers.""

House Republican leaders have expressed confidence that they have the votes necessary to formalise the impeachment inquiry, despite an extremely narrow majority in the chamber in which they can only afford to lose three votes.

Democrats and even some Republicans have criticised the impeachment investigation, which the White House has called a ""political stunt"" designed to hurt the president's re-election bid.

But it comes amid growing pressure from hardline conservatives to take action against Mr Biden. Ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September claiming Republicans had unearthed a ""culture of corruption"" surrounding Mr Biden.

Republicans have held one hearing related to the inquiry, during which an expert witness called by Republicans said there was not yet enough evidence to impeach Mr Biden.

The oversight committee claims the Biden family and its business associates received more than $24m (Â£19m) from foreign sources in China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2019.","Hunter Biden defies Republican subpoena to testify before House panelBy Bernd Debusmann Jr & Madeline Halpert BBC News, on Capitol Hill and in New YorkWatch Hunter Biden: I've been the target of unrelenting 'Trump attack machine'Hunter Biden has called an impeachment probe into his father ""shameless,"" as he refused to testify at a private hearing with Republican lawmakers.

From Barbados to Belize, nations are beginning to swap debt for action on climate and conservation. But how far can this help without deeper reform of the global financial system?

Hundreds of miles off the coast of South America lie the rocky, volcanic islands of the Galapagos. Teeming with unusual creatures â from jaunty, blue-footed birds to dragon-like iguanas â these bountiful isles have long inspired innovative thinking.

A visit by the 19th-Century naturalist Charles Darwin prompted his famous theory of evolution, which proposed that species that are more adapted to their surroundings are more likely to survive. And now the islands are playing host to a very contemporary adaptation experiment: debt relief in exchange for spending on climate and nature.

Earlier this year, Ecuador, which has sovereignty over the Galapagos, announced a record-setting deal. With the help of the private Credit-Suisse investment bank and the US development bank, it refinanced $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) of government bonds at a discounted rate and issued a new ""blue bond"". In exchange, at least $12m (Â£10m) a year of the money saved via this cheaper loan will now be funnelled into conservation efforts in the remote archipelago.

Known as debt-for-nature or debt-for-climate swaps, these new financial tools are gaining ground in among severely indebted countries, from Barbados to Belize. Plus, in freeing money to restore ecosystems and build resilience, some believe they are shaping up to be part of the answer to a wider question: how to fund the world's climate change response?

Closing the climate funding gap

According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), developing economies will need an annual $2.4 trillion (Â£1.9tn) of investment in climate action in the coming years. But wealthier nations have so far been slow to deliver on financial pledges to help poorer nations adapt to a hotter world. The new ""loss and damage"" fund announced at this year's COP28 launched with $400m (Â£318m) from rich nations. But developing nations stand to lose 1,000 times that much each year to climate change, by one estimate.

This money could fund projects that bolster natural defences, such as restoring mangroves to help protect against floods, or reforming agriculture to improve food system resilience.

Yet many nations are also not in a position to finance the above shifts. Loans can help â and in 2020 71% of public climate finance was provided this way â but last year more than 50 developing countries were already in severe debt. Some nations are currently paying their creditors more than 12 times what they spend on climate measures.

Much of today's economic vulnerability is also being caused by exogeneous shocks, not by poor macro management, explains Vera Swonge, co-chair of UN's independent high level group on climate finance. From Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine, to climate disasters, recent global events have slowed economic growth and pushed up interest rates. The result is that many poorer nations' debt burdens are skyrocketing, through no fault of their own. ""We can't fix the climate issue unless we fix the debt issue,"" as the president of Kenya recently summed it up.

Debt-for-nature in a nutshell Put simply, being in debt can be very expensive for the indebted nation. Plus is can also be risky for creditors, since if a nation becomes unable to pay back its debt it will default. In the case of some severely indebted nations, deals have been negotiated where creditors sell back their portion of the debt at a reduced rate â and so relieve themselves of the risk. New cheaper loans are then issued in exchange for a commitment that some of the saved money is set aside for action on nature or climate.

One way for indebted nations to respond to debt crises is by boosting exports of primary resources like fuel, forests or fish â but keeping these assets intact is now key to capturing carbon and saving biodiversity. Equally, debt can't be fixed without climate action either, for when climate-linked disasters strike, economies are further strained. Twenty-eight of the most severely indebted nations are already among the most climate-vulnerable.

Urgent debt relief is thus needed ""to avert a deepening development crisis,"" the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned.

Bonding with nature

In the midst of these combined nature, climate and cost of living crises, are debt swaps for poorer nations the answer?

In 2015, the Seychelles wrote off almost $22m (Â£16.8m) of its debt in exchange for creating 13 new marine protected areas where fishing, oil exploration and other development is either banned or severely restricted. Belize, in 2021, was about to default on half a billion dollars, but it similarly shrank its debt by creating a blue bond to steer the savings into a fund for conservation. And in Portugal this year, the government pledged to reinvest the $650m (Â£524m) it is owed by Cape Verde back into the archipelago's green transition.

One advantage of such ""swaps"" is that they don't undermine a nation's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for them to borrow in the long-term. That might happen if debt was entirely written-off, says Andrew Deutz, managing director of global policy and conservation finance at The Nature Conservancy, an international conservation organisation has helped to roll-out a number of the schemes in Belize, Gabon and Barbados.

Deutz explains that by partially guaranteeing new, cheaper loans, nations' more expensive creditors can be paid off and the savings put towards marine protection. This may be ""a pretty weird thing for an NGO"" to do, he admits, as they are not a bank and their balance sheet is limited, but they're hoping to build a coalition that can ""accelerate"" and build from their proof-of-concepts.

Plus, there are early suggestions that the concept is helping conservation. The Belize deal has already led to an expansion of its ocean protection zone and the designation of public lands as mangrove reserves, according to an inaugural impact report. Meanwhile, in the Seychelles, where the new conservation effort has been in place for longer, 400,000 sq km (154,000 sq miles) of sea is now protected and blue whales have made a return.

Among the first beneficiaries of Belize's new fund is MarAlliance, a non-profit founded by marine conservation scientist Rachel Graham. The $327,000 (Â£260,000) that they've been awarded for three years will help restore the Gladden Spit and the Silk Cayes marine reserve. These stretches of ocean are home to unusually large populations of spawning finfish, and used to be a feeding hotspot for visiting whale-sharks. More than 20 years ago, Graham's research was instrumental in getting the area declared a special reserve, which helped replace unsustainable local fishing jobs with tourism opportunities. Since then, however, management has lapsed and poaching has increased â to the point where sharks are barely sighted anymore.

""We're going to assess the status of the spawning aggregations and study why the sharks aren't coming,"" Graham says. ""Should we expand the protected area to help meet local and national conservation goals? Can we help support the local NGO in community engagement, managing the site and enforcing the protections? And how is climate change impacting habitats and fish stocks? These are some of the questions we are tackling.""

The new funding should help find answers to these challenges. But there are also drawbacks to the mechanism as it currently stands, Graham stresses. Overburdensome reporting requirements hold up work and limit the type of organisation that can apply for grants, with smaller non-profits unable to afford the extra administrative costs. ""We've run out of time: we have to implement the solutions now.""

Cancelling injustice

Not everyone thinks such debt-swaps are a good approach, however. Administrative concerns aside, wider questions still remain about their impact.

We've run out of time: we have to implement the solutions now â Rachel Graham

The deals can have high transaction costs and are not on their own enough answer a nation's debt problems, warns Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the US. The amount of debt relief the country gets is marginal, there is no adequate monitoring of the nature-benefits that will accrue, and the money is nowhere near enough to allow a country to deal with loss and damage costs, or even proper climate mitigation, she says.

But Deutz points out they can do some things other interventions so far have not. ""As a conservation or climate finance mechanism, these debt-for-nature swaps are actually extraordinarily efficient delivery mechanisms compared with existing alternatives in the marketplace.""

Alternatively, another option is to cancel a significant part of the debts outright. In 1950s Germany, Ghosh notes, creditors hoped to avoid a return to Nazism by wiping out half the nation's debt and transformed the other half into soft loans â which have low interest rates and no debt payment required if the country had a trade deficit.

And today, some campaigners argue debts should be cancelled in countries that need it, with assistance provided in the forms of grants not loans. More than 500 economists, climate experts and activists recently signed an open letter calling for action to this effect.

""Eliminating climate debt is essential for acknowledging the uneven burden of climate change on overexploited nations, which have the least contribution to global emissions,"" says Anuna De Wever, a climate activist who was prominent in Belgium's school strikes for climate. ""We will not stand a chance against the climate crisis if we don't tackle the grave inequality that continues to exist through colonial legacies.""

But cancelling a nation's debt outright is complicated by the diversity of creditors that now exist. Plus, for those that can avoid it, default or debt cancellation is not the preferred option, warns Swonge. ""Many African countries worked hard to improve their macro performance and obtain market access; they do not want to lose that"" she says. Cancellation may be ""useful and important"" for some nations that are really struggling, but not for all.

Cooperation not competition

Instead, a wider menu of reforms could all play a role in helping making debt more affordable and bolstering climate finance at the same time.

The Bridgetown Initiative, co-launched by the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley in 2022, has recently become a touchstone for calls to modernise the current global financial system. Its suggested reforms include automatic pauses in debt repayments if climate disaster strikes, extending the length of loans, reducing their costs, and setting up a facility to help if exchange rates change.

Multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) can lend at cheaper rates than capital markets. And as Mottley reminded world leaders at this year's global financial summit in Paris , they were established ""to help the world in the reconstruction effort after World War Two. We are in a moment that is equal to World War Two with respect to climate.""

Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2e. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2e per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.

The Paris summit did not result in any major reform, but the presidents of Kenya and France, alongside a host of major philanthropic foundations and NGOs, have signalled their support for the Bridgetown Initiative. Plus a raft of coalitions and institutions, including a UN advisory board, are now making similar proposals.

One of these proposals is short-term liquidity buffers, for example through a debt service mechanism which reprofiles their debt, says Swonge, so that indebted nations can plough the savings back into growth and bring down their debt to GDP ratio, which makes debt easier to repay. Another is to speed up the time in which nations can access debt resolution, adds David McNair, executive director at The One Campaign, a group that fights poverty.

A further suggestion is to encourage the UN's International Monetary Fund to reform the way it issues special drawing rights. These reserve assets are released in quotas and can be traded for hard currency at the IMF's low interest rate. If they were issued regularly and selectively to countries facing climate threats or suffering in the wake of disasters, they could be much more effective, Ghosh argues.

So where does all this leave debt-for-nature swaps?

""Since they free up resources towards traditionally underfunded areas like conservation, they can be an important tool,"" says Rishikesh Bhandary, assistant director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University. ""But they are just one tool in a range of instruments that will have to be deployed to tackle sovereign debt.""

At this year's COP28, Colombia, Kenya and France announced an expert review on debt, climate and nature. And while there is clearly still a way to go on turning the range of proposals into action, the various calls for reform all suggest that the debt and climate crises stand a better chance of being solved together than they do apart.

In the words of Darwin himself: ""in the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed"".

--","What if debt was written off to protect climate and nature?
The result is that many poorer nations' debt burdens are skyrocketing, through no fault of their own.
""Eliminating climate debt is essential for acknowledging the uneven burden of climate change on overexploited nations, which have the least contribution to global emissions,"" says Anuna De Wever, a climate activist who was prominent in Belgium's school strikes for climate.
But cancelling a nation's debt outright is complicated by the diversity of creditors that now exist.

McDonald's has begun to open the first locations of its experimental, retro coffee drive-through. CosMc's is entering a crowded market, but may have a playbook for success.

The promise of galactic beverages drew hundreds to the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook, Illinois, last Thursday. Customers queued for hours; some offered bribes to shorten their wait. Lines of cars snaked around the village of fewer than 80,000 residents, all in pursuit of one thing: a specialty sip from CosMc's, McDonald's new beverage concept store.

The restaurant, which was announced only a day before its soft opening on 7 December, is ""rooted in beverage exploration"". Unlike a standard McDonald's storefront, CosMc's is drive-through only; the new approach also leans into what the company calls ""bold and unexpected flavour combinations"": think specialty lemonades, cold-coffee concoctions and signature slushes. McDonald's plans to open approximately 10 pilot locations in the US by the end of 2024.

It's entering a crowded-and-growing market of fast-coffee heavyweights. According to data from Allegra World Coffee Portal, an insights platform focused on the coffee industry, the branded-coffee market currently stands 7% above its pre-pandemic size, with market leaders Starbucks and Dunkin' projected to reach 16,144 and 9,434 US stores in 2024, respectively.

These numbers may be daunting for a new player in the fast-coffee space â but experts say CosMc's may be poised to carve out its own place in the highly competitive landscape.

Finding a niche in a booming market

Andrea Hernandez, the founder of Snaxshot, a food-and-beverage insights platform, suggests CosMc's may have something to offer Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers (those born between 1996 and 2024).

""Starbucks was the millennial drink, but Gen Z is all about counter-culture â they're looking for something else,"" says Hernandez. Particularly appealing are ""beverages that you can remix exactly how you like them"".

Nothing exemplifies that passion for personalisation quite like DrinkTok, a TikTok community, whose hashtag has more than 4 billion views. DrinkTokers have propelled specialty beverages, such as Starbucks' Pink Matcha Drink, to viral fame â ""hacking"" menus with extensive customisations and showing off their creations. Curating CosMc's offerings, McDonald's seems to understand how critical is to tap into this consumer desire: the CosMc's press release boasts ""customisations at every turn: popping boba, flavor syrups, energy or Vitamin C shots, and so much more.""

Starbucks was the millennial drink, but Gen Z is all about counter-culture â they're looking for something else â Andrea Hernandez.

CosMc's menu also caters to younger generations' taste for chilled drinks. Allegra World Coffee Portal CEO Jeffrey Young says the data shows ""younger consumers prefer cold [beverages], while the older consumers prefer hot"" â a phenomenon Hernandez calls ""cold-beverage supremacy"".

Currently, the new chain's menu features only six hot-coffee options, a selection of hot teas and a standard hot chocolate. The real focus, however, is on youth-centric cold drinks, with iced-coffee options including a S'Mores Cold Brew topped with toffee sprinkles, and an entire menu dedicated to slushes and frappÃ©s. The offerings also emphasise bold, fruity flavours popular with DrinkTokers.

Early buzz seems to indicate the formula is working. While the DrinkTok masses haven't posted their favourite concoctions yet â possibly due to the flagship restaurant's somewhat remote location in the centre of the US â the hashtag #CosMc already has 39 million views, and TikTok influencers are garnering hundreds of thousands of likes posting CosMc's content.

'A different type of drinker'

Although a newcomer to the branded-coffee market, McDonald's isn't exactly starting from scratch. It already knows plenty about coffee and its consumers through its McCafÃ© coffee offerings, available in its US stores (McCafÃ© also has a wide presence outside of the US as standalone locations). Some experts estimate McDonald's sells upwards of a half-billion cups of coffee each year.

McCafÃ© focuses on hot drinks like coffee and espresso, and also encourages customers to slow down and enjoy cushy seating and jazzy ambience based on old, iconic European coffee culture. The CosMc's approach couldn't be further from this model; instead, these new restaurants emphasise a speedy, playful experience â differentiation not only from its parent brand's own McCafÃ©, but also from CosMc's competitors.

Hernandez says this attempt to take a new approach might be CosMc's playbook for success. ""Dunkin' is about utility â 'America runs on Dunkin' â and Starbucks is more of a luxury-lifestyle brand,"" she says. ""To succeed, McDonald's has to go toward a different type of drinker.""

To Allegra's Young, that customer profile is obvious. ""This new era of younger consumers wants things to be fun, they want things to be accessible, they want fast-paced service: things like using kiosks, ordering on your phone and using the drive-through,"" he says. ""[McDonald's is] playing right into the hands of younger consumers.""

Those consumers, he argues, don't need the emotional, cult-like attachment that drives millennial consumers to Starbucks and Dunkin'. They're looking for indulgent, bold, highly individualised options in a uniquely convenient setting.

Will CosMc's revolutionise the art of coffee as a direct competitor to Starbucks and Dunkin'? Maybe not â but, as Hernandez and Young both point out, it may not have to. The brand is putting younger consumers to the forefront, just as Gen Z and Gen Alpha start to gain purchasing power.","Lines of cars snaked around the village of fewer than 80,000 residents, all in pursuit of one thing: a specialty sip from CosMc's, McDonald's new beverage concept store.

From Jogyesa to Gilsanga, these are the must-visit temples every traveller should see, according to an acclaimed local Buddhist priest.

""Before we begin"", said Jang Jeok, a Buddhist priest whose name means ""extreme calmness"" in Korean, ""you must clear your mind of all traces of city noise. Let us meditate."" I'd just hiked an hour uphill through Seoul's Bukhansan National Park to reach Jang at Ilseonsa Temple, where he has lived alone for the last seven years, keeping constant watch over the city below.

For a compact nation, South Korea has an astonishing number of Buddhist temples â approximately 20,000, some of which are more than 1,000 years old. Korean temples stand apart visually from temples in other parts of Asia, as many are timber-frame structures made of Korean red pine that are painted in the country's traditional Dancheong (aquamarine) hue that adornes wooden buildings. Some also feature out-of-this-world chanting. It all combines to produce a soul-soothing recipe for serenity.

Given his intimate and expert familiarity on the topic, I'd come to Jang for his advice about which Buddhist temples travellers should see in Seoul. ""While I definitely advise tourists to visit Jogyesa and Bongeunsa, I strongly recommend that they seek out small temples, such as those located by mountains and rivers,"" he said. ""Since they are not commercialised and are in harmony with nature, one is bound to have a more spiritual experience and leave Seoul with better memories.""

Here, Jang offers his expert picks of seven Seoul temples you shouldn't miss.

1. Best classic favourite: Jogyesa

According to Jang, no guide to Seoul's best temples would be complete without mentioning Jogyesa. Constructed in 1395, Jogyesa is South Korea's most important temple. It is the chief temple of the Jogye Order that represents the largest segment of the country's Buddhist population â which comprises approximately 1,900 active temples, 13,000 monks and nuns and 7 million followers.

Located in the heart of downtown Seoul, Jogyesa is surrounded by high-rise buildings, creating a wonderful ancient-meets-modern juxtaposition. And while Jang says a temple surrounded by corporate and financial buildings may make for a less spiritual experience, it remains popular with travellers and locals alike. Here, visitors will witness many genuine displays of religious devotion, as people sit outside the doors of Daeungjeon, the main temple hall, studying Buddhist texts before circumambulating the lofty, 500-year-old Sophora japonica tree â also known as ""the Scholar tree"".

One of Jang's favourite times to visit is in the months leading up to the national holiday of Buddha's birthday (Buchonim oshin nal) in the spring (roughly mid-April to mid-May). During this period, colourful lanterns are strung up like a hanging carpet above the temple grounds and sunlight penetrates the gaps, casting dappled light on everything and everyone below. While lanterns can be found at all temples at this time, they are at their most numerous and impressive at Jogyesa, and temple workers ascend on hydraulic lifts to attach the handwritten prayers of devotees between them.

2. Best for evening solitude: Bongeunsa

Roughly 10km south-east of Jogyesa is Bongeunsa, one of the country's oldest temples that dates from 794. It runs a variety of cultural programmes for tourists and foreign residents, such as temple stays and Templelife â a 2.5-hour event every Thursday from 14:00 to 16:30 where visitors join a group for a temple tour, tea ceremony and a meditative session spent copying sutras by hand (30,000 KRW/Â£18.50).

The SpeciaList

Visit Bongeunsa in the evening as the blue hour fades to night, when the temple empties out to just a few lone souls. On weekdays, if you linger in the courtyard in front of the main hall where a monk may be chanting as incense burns, you'll notice a handful of office workers visiting to pray and bow. Jang also suggests exploring the grounds away from the big hall, moving in the opposite direction to the main road outside to seek quiet and solitude until the only sound that can be heard is the crunch of gravel under foot.

Overhead loom the city's tallest and glitziest high-rise apartment towers, a sign that you're in Gangnam District's Samseong-dong neighbourhood, one of Seoul's most affluent areas. Don't miss the 23m-tall Maitreya statue â the future Buddha who will one day descend to Earth to preach the dharma anew â whose reflection in the polished stone floor is a sight to behold at this time of evening. Nearby, there's a simple on-site eatery serving vegan temple food (such as soft tofu, greens, rice and a light soup).

3. Best for history: Gilsanga

According to Jang, the modern temple of Gilgangsa may have the most fascinating story of any temple in Seoul. While the building itself is considerably older, it only became a working temple in 1997. It was originally a famous yojeong (a restaurant where powerful male political figures would meet after dark to dine and interact with courtesans) calledDaewongak. Daewongak was one of the three-most popular restaurants of its kind in the 1970s and '80s and was owned by a gisaeng (a woman from an outcast or slave family trained to be a courtesan to provide entertainment and converse with upper-class men) named Kim Yeong-han (1916-1999).

In the mid-1990s, Kim decided to change the course of her life after reading and being powerfully affected by the book Musoyu (Non-Possession) by a monk named the Venerable Beopjeong, and she informed him that she wished to donate the sprawling property â valued in the millions of dollars â to him to turn it into a temple. In return she received the Buddhist name Gilsanghwa and a simple set of prayer beads. Beopjeong fulfilled her wish in 1997 by opening the new temple to the public. Today, Gilsangsa runs cultural programmes with names such as ""Find Your True Self in the Busy City"" â as, indeed, Kim believed that she had at the end of her life.

According to Jang, visitors can spot various features from its previous incarnation as Daewongak while walking through Gilsangsa's landscaped grounds. For example, some of the small outbuildings and rooms have been repurposed from their days as the domain of courtesans and turned into solitary meditation rooms. Jang says that Gilsangsa is best visited by first going to the Hansung University subway station on Line 4 before taking a local bus up the hill to the temple.

4. Best for ancient traditions: Bongwonsa

Jang is particularly fond of Bongwonsa, a temple nestled at the foot of Ansan Mountain, west of the downtown area. Founded in 889, Bongwonsa belongs to the Taego Order, the second-largest order of Korean Buddhism. Unlike the Jogye Order, whose monks must remain celibate, Taego monks are allowed to marry and have children (although notably nuns of both orders must remain celibate). ""This leads to a hereditary line of monks, where one becomes a monk if one's father was a monk,"" Jang said. ""This in turn has led to the strong preservation of ancient traditions, Buddhist artefacts and things such as traditional Korean dances.""

Among these traditions is an unmissable event in early June each year known as the Yeongsanjae, where world peace and the reunification of North and South Korea are the themes of traditional music and dance performances. The Seoul Lotus Flower Culture Festival is also held here later in the summer. ""There's nowhere else in Seoul like Bongwonsa,"" said Jang.

To get here from Sinchon station, take the 7024 bus for a seven-minute ride into what feels like a historical village of well-preserved traditional houses deep in the countryside. It's a world away from the metal and glass of the skyscrapers of Seoul's Mapo District, where Sinchon station is located and where most visitors arrive.

5. Best for a natural escape: Hwagyesa

Hwagyesa, built in 1522, is a serene temple complex surrounded by the foothills of Mt Samgak. Encircled by forest, the temple has a strong connection to nature, which ticks one of Jang's boxes for a ensuring a truly spiritual experience. Moreover, temple stays are possible here, bookable through the national temple stay website at the office opposite Jogyesa, or directly by emailing Hwagyesa. ""You're just a 15-minute walk from the nearest station [Hwagye station], but you wake up feeling as though you're in the middle of the countryside,"" said Jang.

Hwagyesa is also a popular temple for foreign monks to come and visit its renowned Buddhist education centre. The Seoul International Zen Center, based at Hwagyesa, offers a three-month meditation course every summer. Also, Hwagyesa offers weekly classes for tourists and foreign residents who wish to learn about Buddhism every Saturday.

As you walk uphill to the temple complex from the entrance gate, you'll hear the sound of running water from a crystal-clear stream beside the lane. You may also run into happy-but-slightly-bleary-eyed visitors who wake up at 04:00 each morning to meditatively perform 108 prostrations â which pales in comparison to the 3,000 performed here by monks and nuns on the last Saturday of every month.

6. Best for easy access: Yeonghwasa

Yeonghwasa, located near the city's eastern boundary, was founded in 674 and has one of the longest histories of any temple in Seoul. In Jang's opinion, it is also one of Seoul's most beautiful temples, thanks to its secluded location in a pine forest on the side of Achasan Mountain. He recommends Yeonghwasa for its ease of access, either by car, bus or subway. Additionally, its proximity to Seoul Children's Grand Park (featuring a park, a zoo, theme park rides and a concert hall) makes it an excellent option for families.

Although it's easy to miss it, Jang recommends seeking out the serene statue of the Maitreya. To locate him, first find the tower housing a giant bell â rung precisely 28 times in the morning and 33 times in the evening to save the souls of all sentient beings in the Universe â and follow a 108-step trail up to the right of it. At the top of the hill is a hall housing the 3.5m-tall Maitreya Buddha, an enigmatically smiling statue said to be capable of healing chronic illnesses, among other miracles.

Heungcheonsa was historically a favourite temple of the Korean royal family (Credit: Ben McKechnie)

7. Best for classic architecture: Heungcheonsa

""Heungcheonsa, founded in 1397, preserves the traditional style of Korean Buddhist architecture better than any other, and it was originally built as a site of prayer and mourning for a queen,"" said Jang.

Know before you go â¢ Temple Stay is a great resource to learn more about temple lodging and book one for your trip to Seoul. â¢ If a monk or nun passes you, consider stopping and bowing slightly to show respect, placing your palms together in front of your chest.This is known as hapjang.

According to Jang, Heungcheonsa represents how temples used to look, with its varied roof tiles and white columns painted with black hanja script (Korean written in Chinese characters). Throughout its history, Heungcheonsa was a favourite temple of the Korean royal family, who frequently paid for its repairs and expansions, even rebuilding it from scratch when it burned to the ground more than once. It was also the first headquarters of the Jogye Order, and one of its rooms hosted a scholar working on developing hangeul â the Korean alphabet â on the order of the revered King Sejong. For Jang, this combination of historical importance and unique visuals makes it stand out. Inquire in the visitor's centre about the handwriting of King Yeongchin, the last crown prince of the Korean Empire, from when he was five years old, which the temple keeps in its collection.

Today, the temple's six main halls and bell tower are dwarfed by modern high-rise apartment blocks that tower over the temple. It's an incongruous setting, but not unphotogenic; for architecture buffs, this in-your-face contrast may well be reason enough to visit. Don't miss the shiny new information centre opposite the temple where visitors can learn more about the history of the temple.

Laced with darkness but ultimately life-affirming, The Shop Around the Corner taps into our love-hate relationship with Christmas â and should be a staple of festive viewing alongside It's a Wonderful Life.

As the star of It's a Wonderful Life, Jimmy Stewart will always be associated with the Christmas movie genre. Nearly 80 years after it was originally released, the 1946 supernatural fantasy about Stewart's George Bailey being saved from his suicidal thoughts on Christmas Eve by his guardian angel Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) is still and probably forever shall be a festive staple for movie fans.

But if you've watched It's a Wonderful Life umpteen times and would like a different classic Christmas movie to enjoy, there's actually another starring Stewart that's perfectly suited to fill its cinematic shoes.

Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 romantic-comedy The Shop Around the Corner sees Stewart play Alfred Kralik, the top salesman at the Budapest leather goods store Matuschek and Company. After immediately falling out with new employee Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan), their relationship deteriorates even further as they're forced to work alongside each other.

What the pair don't know is that they are actually pen pals, and over the course of the endless stream of letters that they've sent to each other, they have fallen in love. Primarily set in the weeks leading up to Christmas, The Shop Around the Corner is about as elegant as classic Hollywood movies get. ""It's a very charming movie. There's a lot of comedy. It's very simple,"" says Jacqueline Lynch, the author of Christmas in Classic Films. ""But it's not entirely cheery all the way through.""

Much like It's a Wonderful Life, The Shop Around the Corner is laced with a darkness and cynicism, with a story that features meanness, pettiness and miscommunication, that makes it all the more gripping. ""Both films go to dark places and then end on bursts of joy that wouldn't be possible if they hadn't gone to the dark places,"" explains Jeremy Arnold, a film historian and author who wrote Christmas in The Movies: 35 Classics to Celebrate the Season.

In The Shop Around the Corner, the store's owner Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) hires a private detective because he's certain that one of his employees is having an affair with his unseen wife. Matuschek takes out his frustrations on all of his employees, without ever revealing the real reason why. In the film's most dramatic scene, Matuschek even tries to shoot himself.

At the same time, Klara and Alfred's attacks on each other get increasingly pointed, too. She calls him ""a little insignificant clerk"", while at one point she retorts: ""I really wouldn't care to scratch your surface, Mr Kralik, because I know exactly what I'd find. Instead of a heart, a handbag. Instead of a soul, a suitcase. And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter... which doesn't work.""

A darker side to the holidays

The Shop Around the Corner's mixing of comedy, romance, tragedy, and the macabre is particularly heightened because of the film's proximity to Christmas. Each of the characters' vulnerabilities, insecurities and hopes are exposed against the festive fun they're supposed to be experiencing.

""This is one of my favourite subjects at Christmas time,"" says Arnold. ""No matter what our attitude is to Christmas, we all have a love-hate relationship with it. It can inspire great highs, joy, love, togetherness. It can heighten feelings of loneliness, emptiness, wistfulness, alienation, cynicism. Sometimes, we can go through variations of these emotions on a daily basis when it gets closer to Christmas.""

Of course, The Shop Around the Corner is far from the first story or film to have used the Christmas period to transform a negative and unhappy individual into a more compassionate and empathetic version of themselves â I'm looking at you, Ebenezer Scrooge. But Lubitsch makes it all the more potent by how he balances the joy and desperation of his characters, all while using the season and festive imagery to progress them and push the story along.

""Lubitsch fills the frame more and more with holiday visuals and decor â Christmas trees, ornaments, presents, snow, things that we associate with Christmas â as the story gets closer to Christmas,"" says Arnold. ""As the movie moves ahead, it matches how the Stewart and Sullivan characters slowly but steadily get to their happy ending. It's almost as if Christmas time is a catalyst to help turn that hate into love, which is really what the journey is for them.""

As one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood history, Lubitsch found subtle and surprising ways to increase the drama as The Shop Around the Corner gets closer and closer to Christmas. ""Lubitsch was a master at letting the audience figure things out visually,"" explains Arnold.

Lubitsch has a sophisticated style â he makes the audience participate in the storytelling, in the humour and the gags â Jeremy Arnold

The director of Ninotchka, To Be or Not to Be, and Heaven Can Wait was renowned for finding graceful and creative ways to convey plot, motivation and characterisation in a manner that made viewers even more invested in the film. The phrase ""The Lubitsch Touch"" was invented to describe his filmmaking class. As inspiration, legendary writer and director Billy Wilder even had a sign on his wall that asked, ""What would Lubitsch have done?""

""Lubitsch has a sophisticated style,"" explains Arnold. ""He makes the audience participate in the storytelling, in the humour and the gags. You really have to pay attention when you watch a Lubitsch film, because, if you look away from the screen, you're gonna miss a joke or something really important visually that will pay off.""

He used this inventiveness as payoffs to jokes, to create chemistry and tension between Kralik and Novak, and to suddenly unveil pathos and pearls of wisdom. Although The Shop Around the Corner is officially set in Budapest, Lubitsch's approach means that the film has a universality that makes it feels as though it could be unfolding anywhere in the world. And while the supporting cast mostly have European accents, the two leads have American accents.

""I think there's a fairy-tale aspect to it,"" says Lynch. ""Even though it is set in Hungary, we have these American accents. Jimmy Stewart isn't thought of as European in any sense. But he blends perfectly with the other characters. There's a European colourfulness to the supporting cast. Lubitsch brought a European shrug of the shoulders to his stories.""

The German-born filmmaker was attracted to adapt MiklÃ³s LÃ¡szlÃ³'s 1937 Hungarian play Parfumerie because his father had run a similar shop in Berlin when Lubitsch was growing up. ""This was a perfect vehicle for him to recreate his own memories of the experience of the shop. How all the employees quarrel and bicker. That all came from his childhood, his father and the store,"" says Arnold. ""I imagine Lubitsch didn't want to set it in America so he could bring a European flavour to the story and the characters.""

The Shop Around the Corner proved to be so popular with audiences and Hollywood alike that just nine years after it was released, it was remade as the Judy Garland musical In the Good Old Summertime â and most recently it inspired You've Got Mail. The 1998 romcom starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks sees the business rivals falling in love over email rather than letters, and is set entirely in New York.

While undeniably entertaining, You've Got Mail fails to plummet into the desperation of its characters like its predecessor, and even Hanks and Ryan can't quite generate Stewart and Sullavan's spark. ""It just doesn't measure up to The Shop Around the Corner. It has an appealing cast. The story is really amusing. We love Hanks and Ryan. But there's an adult sophistication that is inherent to Lubitsch that is really not quite there,"" believes Arnold.

For Lynch, The Shop Around the Corner and other Christmas movies of that era ""seem to have a lot more depth than modern movies"", which are instead ""very superficial"". She adds, ""They're all about, 'We've got to have the best Christmas ever. It has to be perfect.' Back in the day, they weren't worried about that. They were just coming off the [Great] Depression. You were lucky if you had a meal.""

You get your family where you can find it and you get Christmas where you can find it, too â Jacqueline Lynch

While she's the first to admit that there are certainly commercialised aspects to The Shop Around the Corner â particularly when it comes to the lead characters selling as many products as possible and spending an evening decorating the store â she points to one of the final scenes, where Matuschek and new employee Rudy (Charles Smith) go for dinner because everyone else is busy, as the true message of the film.

""It's about a group of workers in a small store that are like a family. This is Matuschek's family. He's the father figure to them. You get your family where you can find it and you get Christmas where you can find it, too. Sometimes, Christmas doesn't just happen. You have to make it.""

Ultimately, The Shop Around the Corner remains a perfect Christmas watch because of how it blends the complicated feelings that come with the holidays in a candid, unpatronising, and deeply human fashion, while still remaining hopeful. ""It just deals with the holidays in a very interesting, compelling and human way,"" insists Lynch. ""It leaves you with a warm and hopeful feeling of Christmas.""

Tornadoes produce low frequency infrasound that can be picked up from many miles away and sometimes even before the tornado is generated (Credit: Getty Images)

The terrifying, destructive power of tornadoes is as sudden as it is violent. Now scientists are eavesdropping on twisters to develop new early warning systems and fight warning fatigue.

It begins with the rustling of leaves, sinister squeak of hinges and the creak of nearby trees. Then comes a deafening rumble like an approaching freight train, the terrifying screech of nails being ripped from wooden boards and unpredictable thuds from flying debris. These are the sounds often described by tornado survivors recounting their escape from these storms.

They rarely have much warning, but it is often enough to save lives.

There's another sound, however, that accompanies tornadoes that we can't hear. It is so low in frequency it is beyond the realms of human hearing, but it could offer a way of providing earlier, more accurate warnings of these destructive storms.

With winds that can reach up to 483km/h (300 mph), the storms that produce tornadoes generate low frequency sound waves â or infrasound â that can travel for hundreds of miles.

Eavesdropping on these infrasound signals may not be able to prevent tornadoes from flattening towns and tossing cars into the air like toys, but it could lead to a new type of early warning system that might save lives.

Shaky predictions

Yet twisters are notoriously difficult to forecast because we still don't have a clear picture of why they do and do not form. Even when they do form, the violent column of air behaves erratically.

Are tornadoes in the US getting worse?

For decades, meteorologists have struggled to identify which storms will produce tornadoes and which will not. Chris Nowotarski, associate professor in the department of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University says that while experts are ""fairly good"" at predicting the large-scale conditions that can produce tornadoes up to days in advance, predicting when and where specific tornadoes will form is more difficult. ""Several storms that seem capable of producing a tornado might exist in the same favourable environment, but only one or two will actually produce a tornado,"" he says.

The wind itself is also invisible to the human eye. They only become visible due to the presence of water vapour that condenses into a funnel shaped cloud within the vortex of the tornado, where the air pressure is lower, while dust and debris also help to make them visible.

Arrays of infrasound detecting microphones have been shown to pick up the noise produced by tornadoes from more than 100km (60 miles) away

Doppler radar can offer a way of spotting mesocyclones as they are forming as the water carried by these storms reflects the radar signal, but meteorologists are only rarely able to spot actual tornados using this technique. This can also mean the tornado warnings that rely upon this method can often turn out to be false alarms as the supercell thunderstorm detected using the radar don't ever produce a tornado, says Nowotarski. Often, storm spotters on the ground are needed to verify whether a tornado has formed.

""Many storms that appear 'primed' to produce a tornado never do so,"" says Nowotarski. ""False alarms are problematic, because a tornado warning can be disruptive to special events, work, and everyday life. While not as disruptive as a tornado, too many 'boy who cried wolf' events will encourage the public to not take action in future warnings and be unprepared when a tornado actually does it.""

Forecasters also tend to err on the side of caution when issuing warnings â understandable, as the consequences of not sheltering can be deadly. But false alarms lead to fatigue and can be particularly problematic in multi-hazard scenarios in which tornadoes occur within landfalling hurricanes or alongside flash flooding, says Nowotarski.

This has left forecasters looking for other ways to predict whether a tornado is on its way.

Eavesdropping on tornadoes

Scientists have been listening to tornadoes and trying to work out whether they produce a unique sound since the 1970s. Experimental evidence suggests that low-frequency infrasound, with a frequency range of 1-10Hz , is produced while a tornado is taking shape and throughout its life. One recent set of measurements from a tornado near Lakin, Kansas in May 2020 revealed that the twister produced a distinct, elevated signal between 10Hz and 15Hz. In some cases arrays of infrasound detecting microphones have been shown to pick up the noise produced by tornadoes from more than 100km (60 miles) away and have also indicated that the infrasound is produced before tornadogenesis even begins.

Researchers hope that by eavesdropping on these noises, it may be possible to not only hear a tornado coming but perhaps even predict them up to two hours before they form.

Since 2020, a team from Oklahoma State University has been testing infrasound's predictive powers using equipment installed in tornado-chasing vehicles. Their portable kit, the Ground-based Local Infrasound Data Acquisition, or ""Glinda"", system, references a character from The Wizard of Oz. They hope the equipment will help storm chasers to better monitor the development of tornadoes in real time, but requires the equipment to be deployed to the right place at the right time.

Some researchers, however, are working on systems that can be left to permanently monitor for tornadoes. One group, led by Roger Waxler, principal scientist at the National Centre for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) based at the University of Mississippi, are planning to deploy four permanent arrays of high-tech sensors in south Mississippi to detect infrasound signals. They hope the system will provide a way of consistently monitoring and detecting tornadoes.

It's not unreasonable that we could localise a tornado to half a football field â Roger Waxler

""Analysis of years of data collected during tornado seasons has left little doubt that tornadoes radiate an infrasonic signal that can be detected on an array of infrasound sensors and followed from great distances,"" says Waxler. ""This gives us confidence that a tornado's path can be determined from simultaneous infrasonic detections on multiple arrays.â

The arrays he and his team are deploying should stay active for at least three tornado seasons, which they hope will enable them to analyse infrasound data in real time.

Waxler's team first gathered evidence to support their infrasound theory by using sensors originally designed to detect clandestine nuclear weapons tests. ""They are considered state-of-the-art for detecting signals from extremely large explosions,"" he says.

After tornado outbreak struck Oklahoma in 2011, his team looked at data they collected and were able to track a particular tornado in an EF4 storm for 100 miles (161km). ""In that case the tornado got close enough so that its signal got very loud,"" he says. They had initially started chasing the tornadoes and dropping sensors as close as they could get â something he admits was a ""horrible idea"" and led to his team developing fixed tornado-spotting arrays instead.

More recently, in 2020, the researchers used their sensor arrays in northern Alabama to detect almost every tornado that passed through the region.

One of the concerns about potential infrasound early warning systems is whether they will be able to distinguish between tornado signals and the general noise of a storm. But researchers say they can see a clear signal. ""We even have one case where the nature of the signal changed, and we could see that the tornado was in the air,"" says Waxler. ""It would be advantageous if we could distinguish when one was on the ground versus in the air.""

There are more challenges to overcome. Wind noise can interfere with infrasound measurements and there is uncertainty about whether infrasound can reliably tell the difference between storm types. ""One recent study suggests that tornadic and non-tornadic storms may produce very similar infrasound signatures, so the potential for using infrasound to home in on potential tornadoes may be limited,"" Nowotarski says.

Waxler says some sources of infrasound in storms such as thunder can be easily distinguished. ""Thunder has different spectral characteristics [such as pulse interval, amplitude and wave length] â it's easy to tell that that's not a tornado,"" he says. But he admits that telling the difference between tornadoes and supercells that do not produce tornadoes presents a challenge. Some of that might be because some supercells are producing tornadoes but are not being spotted by eyewitnesses in a way that helps corroborate the infrasound signals. ""We need more data,"" Waxler says.

Giving fair warning

But Waxler and his team hope their decade-long experiment will lead to an effective early warning system for tornadoes, particularly when combined with other sources such as doppler radar.

""It's not unreasonable that we could localise a tornado to half a football field,"" adds Waxler. ""I envision seeing a map on an app with a dot that shows there's a tornado coming up South Lamar [Avenue, for example].""

Warnings have improved in recent decades: from 2003 to 2017, 87% of deadly tornadoes were preceded by an advance warning, but people still have an average of just 10-15 minutes to find shelter.

A study based on interviews with 23 survivors of two deadly tornadoes found that people tried to evaluate and respond to the risk of a tornado as the situation evolved, but some did not have a place to shelter easily. Experts believe tornado warnings are too often ignored due to ""warning fatigue"" created by false alarms and hours of televised storm coverage. One study found 37% of people surveyed did not understand the need for taking precautionary measures during a tornado warning.

Waxler hopes that a more accurate early warning system could change the way people respond when they hear a storm is approaching. ""Rather than going to hide in your bathtub or cellar, it might be a better idea to get in your car and drive if you know where a tornado is. ""The goal is to save lives.""

Data is driving customers to find products that are the right fit for them specifically (Credit: Getty Images)

Ecommerce brands are using customer data to provide highly tailored experiences. AI knows a lot about your buying habits â and it's learning even more.

I recently joined a boxing gym, and as I was on my way home, I received a text from Sam. He said he was a representative with the gym, and he wanted to know if I had enjoyed my first class. (I had.) A few days later, he followed up again, telling me about a package of classes suited to a beginner. Sam has continued to text me ever since, talking casually in the first person as he suggests other options, like a studio membership, that I might be interested in.

I'd willingly handed over my phone number to this gym when I initially signed up, and knew full well it might be used for marketing purposes. What I didn't know, however, was that that a seemingly real person would be talking to me, armed with unique information about my experience.

Sam, it turns out, is the gym's general manager. Although I can't say for sure, in the current ecommerce landscape, he probably isn't spending his days hunched over his phone, eager to text me. Instead, his messages are likely pre-written and automated through some kind of software, based on the data they've already collected about me.

Your gym is one of countless companies collecting data on its customers, and using these insights to target them with personalised shopping experiences. Experts say many brands are taking personalisation a step further, engaging in AI-assisted hyper-personalisation tactics â like Sam's timely texts â to keep consumers spending.

'People are tired of being talked at'

Personalised shopping can take many forms, including texts from your favourite boutique, to Starbucks' birthday rewards, to a personalised email addressed to your cat, by his name, from pet retailer Chewy.

For brands wanting to retain customers, build loyalty and convert in a modern, data-driven way, this kind of marketing is the new normal. And it's essential. Many businesses have found tailored communication helps them break through the noise of social media and mass email blasts, which increasingly miss the mark in an age where consumers are barraged by digital marketing.

""People are tired of being talked at,"" says US-based Rachel Pedersen, author and social media expert. ""They're tired of feeling like everything is selling to them. They want brands to understand their day-to-day and how they use things."" November 2021 research from McKinsey and Company showed 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver personalised interactions, and 76% are frustrated without it.

At its most basic level, personalisation happens in the inbox, with emails tailored to shoppers with information such as relevant styles based on past purchases, unique discount codes and more.

And, says Jessica Morelli, founder of American skincare company Palermo Body, companies don't have to move mountains to do it. ""We use tools that really everyone has access to, and get really smart about how we're segmenting our email list and how we are engaging with customers.""

These tools include the use of browser cookies, which enable websites to remember users, their behaviour and, most importantly, their shopping carts. Brands can then use that information to forgo mass emails, and reach out only when its relevant. Bought a product? Here's what you should buy next. Haven't shopped in a while? Here's what you've missed. Abandoned a shopping cart? Expect an email reminding you to check out, perhaps sweetening the deal with a discount code.

According to the McKinsey research, these personalisation tactics are small but mighty, potentially driving a 10% to 15% revenue lift. The more a company learns about their customers, the more effectively it can target them. AI tools not only find patterns in past behaviour, but can also use that information to predict what people might do next â their estimated next purchase dates or the probability of a repeat purchase, for instance â so brands can respond accordingly.

They're tired of feeling like everything is selling to them. They want brands to understand their day-to-day and how they use things â Rachel Pedersen

The success of personalisation goes beyond a customer making a purchase. McKinsey reports it's just as vital for repeat engagement and building loyalty: 78% of customers said personalised communications from a brand made them more likely to re-purchase, plus recommend the brand to friends and family. Overall, the study showed companies that excel at personalisation generated 40% more revenue from those activities than those who did not.

There's a fine line to walk, however, between effective personalisation and overstepping. As advanced as these tools are, they cannot account for every single aspect of a person's life.

The more personal the outreach, the more a brand stands to lose from a misfire. For instance, a Mother's Day discount landing in the inbox of someone grieving a parent, or who has an otherwise complicated relationship with the holiday, can sour a customer. Data is not always perfect â and technology isn't yet at the point where it can replace human intuition.

AI, human or both?

Still, while some customers may chafe at an unsolicited text, or the knowledge of just how much of their data is in the hands of brands, tailored communication is the likely future of shopping.

A 2023 Twilio Segment report showed roughly 92% of companies are already using AI-driven personalisation to drive growth. And according to New York-based Kim Robinson Jr, founder of entrepreneurship platform 3pts, it's something that's only going to become more sophisticated in 2024.

As technology evolves, it will come to know more about shoppers, and brands hope it'll drive more purchases (Credit: Getty Images)

He says customised interactions will start to appear at every step of a customer's ecommerce journey, tailored to not just their shopping behaviour, but also the weather of their current locations and their body types, resulting in tactics as drastic as individualised pricing to make each customer feel special â and be more likely to convert to a sale. Robinson says customers can expect AI tools that will react in real time with offers and suggestions of style, size and colour, the same way a sales associate would respond to someone walking around a store.

While these tools are effective for brands, it also puts power in the hands of customers. Stores are not only willing to meet them where they are, but also wherever they might be in the future. They are also willing to offer up rewards and discounts to remain in a customer's shopping rotation. The more a customer shares â knowingly or unknowingly â with a brand, the more tailored their experience will be.

However, don't expect the human element to disappear entirely.

For one, real creators may become part of the future experience, says Robinson. ""When you drop a cart, maybe you get an email from someone who has an audience and a general point of view relating to this, talking about, 'Here's how I've used this product in the past; go to my channel',"" he says. ""I do think it'll be a mix of AI and creators, both personalising it further, making it more human, but then less human.""

Morelli, too, says that as important as AI and data are to the marketing strategy for her skincare brand, her personal touch has made a difference to customers looking for a tailored experience. For instance, after a recent delay in orders, she contacted customers herself to apologise. ""One of the responses I got was, 'It feels good to support a small business, but getting an email directly from the founder is next level'.""

This kind of personalized engagement with customers is something audiobook service Audible heavily leans on. On X, formerly Twitter, they'll invite followers to share their recent favourite books so they can reply directly with a specific recommendation for what to read next. Social video content is similarly catered to questions that come directly from their community, from breaking down the Audible Plus catalogue to announcing their launch in Brazil.","The art and science of hyper-personalised shoppingBy Kate Lindsay Features correspondentGetty ImagesData is driving customers to find products that are the right fit for them specifically (Credit: Getty Images)Ecommerce brands are using customer data to provide highly tailored experiences.

Cardamom buns are an everyday staple that epitomise Swedish culture (Credit: Reda & Co/Alamy)

Cardamom has been a key spice in Swedish culture since medieval times, and now it's popularity in soft, fluffy Swedish buns is taking the pastry global.

Buns are to the Swedes what croissants are to the French: an everyday staple that epitomises the culture. They are consumed during the daily Swedish coffee break known as fika and can be found everywhere from supermarkets and cafes to artisanal bakeries. There is even an annual day of celebration called Cardamom Bun Day held on 15 May.

Eating a cardamom bun (known as kardemummabulle) is a feast for the senses. The first thing you notice is its intricate braided design, dusted with cardamom and sugar. In close quarters, the heady scent of cardamom seduces you. Biting into a bun, you are met with a combination of textures â the crispy top layer breaks off to reveal a soft and buttery interior. The bottom is crisp and caramelised, where sugar and butter have pooled and crystallised while baking. As you eat it, the flavour of cardamom floods your tastebuds.

Buns are not the only Swedish sweet where green cardamom (elettaria cardamomum) is a key ingredient. Even though it is the third-most expensive spice in the world, cardamom is prolific in Swedish cuisine. It's used year-round in waffles, pancakes, biscuits such as kardemummakakor (cardamom cookies), and cakes such as mjuk pepparkak (Swedish spice cake). It is consumed at Christmas in risgrynsgrÃ¶t (rice porridge), baked rice pudding and found in drinks such as glogg (mulled wine), mumma (a Christmas drink featuring lager and stout), Falcons Julmumma (a brand of beer produced by Carlsberg Sverige) and Julmust (a seasonal soft drink featuring spices).

Culinary archaeologist Daniel Serra, who co-wrote the book An Early Meal â a Viking Age Cookbook and Culinary Odyssey, believes that cardamom first became of interest in Scandinavia in the 13th Century for both its medicinal and culinary use, as documented in the old cookbook Libellus de Arte Coquinaria. ""There was an idea in medieval medical practices that cardamom was good for you when it was cold, which makes sense why it would be of interest in a cold climate like ours.""

Conny Johansson

However, a lack of historical records means it is not known exactly how and when cardamom was first used in Sweden, but written documentation shows that the spice entered the country's lexicon in the 16th Century. And while there are different theories as to how cardamom made its way from the Indian subcontinent, where it originated, to Sweden, no one knows the exact route or means.

Ulrika Torell, a curator at The Nordic Museum in Stockholm and author of Sugar and Sweet Things: A Cultural-Historical Study of Sugar Consumption in Sweden, added, ""Cardamom appears in several recipes for seasoning wine, spirits and confectionery from at least the 16th Century, but was probably used earlier as well.""

Despite cardamom being documented in Sweden some 500 years ago, it took much longer for the spice to be widely consumed. The establishment of commercial trading by the Swedish East India Company with India, China and the Middle East in the 18th Century increased the availability of spices in Sweden, according to Elisabeth Johansson, pastry chef and judge on The Great Swedish Bake Off. Johansson is also a judge for Sweden's annual Pastry Chef of the Year competition.

Johansson noted that cardamom was featured in several recipes in the book Helpful Guide in Housekeeping for Young Women by Casja Warg in 1755. Nonetheless, cardamom and other spices were consumed primarily by the wealthy.

The other iconic Swedish bun On 13 December, Sweden celebrates Santa Lucia day, sharing freshly baked sweet goods like gingerbread cookies and Lucia buns (lussekatter), made with saffron, raisins (or currants) and almonds. These seasonal s-shaped buns are part of the 400-year-old-custom celebrating Saint Lucia, a young girl who secretly brought food to persecuted Christians in Rome, lighting her way with a candlelit wreath on her head.

Fast forward a few centuries when sweet buns came into fashion, likely styled after savoury buns called semlor, traditionally flavoured with caraway. Semlor originated in Germany but were eaten in Sweden from the 15th to 18th Centuries. ""I know that the typical buns associated with Swedish fika are broadly an invention of the 20th Century, from roughly somewhere between 1910 to 1930,"" said Torell. The buns were made in bakeries, rather than at home.

It wasn't until after World War Two in 1950, when baking staples became cheaper and more accessible in Sweden, that buns became more consumed. ""Sugar, butter and flour were more widely available, so more home bakers started to bake pastries. Prior to that they were expensive to cook, and not accessible to ordinary people,"" Johansson said.

Today, the buns consumed for fika come in varieties like cinnamon, cardamom, saffron and semla (a cardamom bun filled with almond paste and cream). Cardamom is the only spice that is a base ingredient across all the different varieties.

Consumer demand for handmade quality buns and bread over the last 30 years has led to a mushrooming of artisanal bakeries in Sweden. One popular bakery in Stockholm is Lillebrors Bageri, which was established by Stefan Berg in 2016. Berg followed his older brother into the bakery business and has worked for nearly 25 years in the industry, including a decade at Stockholm's Valhallabageriet, renowned for its sourdough bread and pastries. Lillebrors Bageri sells around 400 cardamom buns each weekday and around 1,200 buns each weekend day.

""When I first started baking, cinnamon buns were more popular, but cardamon was aways in the dough,"" Berg said. ""Around 15 years ago, there was a switch from cinnamon to cardamom. I believe people like the fresh taste of cardamom."" He added, ""Cardamom buns are easy to eat. They are not fancy, but they are delicious and unpretentious.""

Olle Eriksson, the bakery's vice president, added that the ritual of fika is ""embedded deep within the culture"". ""It's part of the workplace. It's part of getting to know new family,"" he said. ""If you're supposed to meet your in-laws for the first time, it will normally happen over a cardamon bun.""

Berg and Eriksson explained how perfecting the texture of the dough is intrinsic to the success of buns. ""I'd say the bun is more about the texture than the cardamom itself,"" Berg said. ""If you do not have the texture right, the cardamom won't save it. It needs to be soft and chewy.""

Eriksson added, ""The mixing is important. If you mix the dough too much, it will become dry. If you don't do it enough, it's going to be gooey. It's a craft.""

Perhaps a testimony to the deliciousness of the buns is the fact that they have been growing in popularity in other parts of the world in cities like Madrid, Berlin and Tokyo. They have also become increasingly popular in the UK and the US. In London, you can find an array of Swedish pastries at Soderberg, Fabrique, Bageriet, Miel Bakery and Buns from Home. While across the pond in New York City, they're sold at La Cabra, Fabrique, Smor and Otway Bakery.

Fabrique bakery chain founder Charlotta Zetterstrom said, ""We have the same buns across London, Stockholm and New York. When we opened in London and New York we sold buns from day one. Both New Yorkers and Londoners were curious, tried them and loved them. The taste and the texture of the cardamom bun is unique due to the soft dough and the buttery filling. Once you eat them, you become addicted.""

Swedish Cardamom Bun recipe by Elisabeth Johansson

Makes about 32 buns

Ingredients For the dough: 50g (1.7oz) fresh yeast 500g (17.6oz) milk 10g cardamom, ground 6g salt 250g (about 9oz) butter, room temperature 200g (7oz) granulated sugar 1000g (35oz) all-purpose flour For the filling: 200g (7oz) butter, room temperature 90g granulated sugar 80g dark brown sugar 20g cardamom, ground 15g water 10g sugar Â¼ tsp vanilla extract 5g corn flour (corn starch) For the syrup: 200g (7oz) water 90g (3.2oz) granulated sugar 20g honey For the cardamom sugar: 50g (1.7oz) granulated sugar 10g cardamom, ground For the egg wash: 1 egg 15 water 2g salt

Method

Step 1 To make the dough, crumble the yeast into a bowl and add the milk. Add the cardamom, salt and knobs of butter, then add the sugar. Add the flour in small parts and knead the dough for 5-10 minutes with your hands or in a mixer until smooth. Cover the dough with clingfilm or a kitchen towel and let the dough leaven for 30 minutes.

Step 2 Meanwhile, combine all of the ingredients for the filling together in a medium bowl.

Step 3 Roll the dough into a 30x60cm (12x24in) rectangle. Spread the filling on top of the dough. Fold the dough lengthwise. Roll again lightly into a rectangle. Slice crosswise into 1cm (âin) wide strips. Wrap each strip around two fingers and tie the strip into a knot.

Step 4 Put the buns onto an oven tray with baking paper and leave some space around each bun. Let them leaven for 2 hours at room temperature.

Step 5 Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the ingredients for the syrup, just until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool.

Step 6 In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cardamom.

Step 7 Heat the oven to 200C/400F. For the egg wash, beat the egg, water and salt with a fork. Brush the buns with the mixture and let them bake in the middle of the oven for 12-15 minutes or until they are golden brown. Take the buns out of the oven and brush them with the syrup, then sprinkle with sugar and cardamom. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Samuel Chukwueze's winner ensured AC Milan finish third in Group F and drop into the Europa League

Newcastle United's Champions League campaign ended in heartbreak on a night of emotion and drama on Tyneside, as AC Milan came from behind to win at St James' Park and send them out of Europe.

The Toon Army were dreaming of a place in the knockout stages when they took the lead through Joelinton's 33rd-minute thunderbolt while Borussia Dortmund led against Paris St-Germain in Germany.

It was an outcome that would have sent Newcastle through on head-to-head results against PSG - but the mood shifted in a matter of minutes just before the hour.

Teenager Warren Zaire-Emery equalised for the French champions in Germany, then former Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic levelled for Milan.

As both sides pushed for a winner in an open game, Milan keeper Mike Maignan did brilliantly to turn Bruno Guimaraes' shot on to the woodwork before Rafael Leao raced clear for the Italians, only to shoot against the foot of the post.

Newcastle's fate was sealed six minutes from time when Milan struck ruthlessly on the counter-attack, substitute Samuel Chukwueze curling a superb finish high past Martin Dubravka.

It left manager Eddie Howe and his players devastated following a return to the Champions League which was fiercely fought, but has ended with them bottom of Group F and without even the consolation of a place in the Europa League.

Newcastle regret what might have been

When the half-time whistle blew to a huge Tyneside roar, Newcastle were on course for the last 16 of the Champions League - but when a dramatic second half came to its conclusion they were out of Europe completely.

It summed up the swings in fortune on a night when attention was divided between what was unfolding at St James' Park and events in Germany, followed closely to see what impact they had on Newcastle's fate.

Newcastle's destiny was out of their own hands after the controversial stoppage-time penalty which gave PSG a draw in Paris two weeks ago, but they were fulfilling their part of the bargain by dominating a lacklustre AC Milan side overawed by the intensity of their opponents and the atmosphere.

The problem was that Newcastle were always living on the edge and it so proved with those goals, first for PSG in Germany then Milan on Tyneside, which was the start of the downfall.

Eddie Howe congratulates Joelinton after his first Champions League goal for Newcastle gave them the lead

Newcastle did not create enough for all their possession, and were punished as they employed a high-risk strategy in the hope of creating the victory and the potential to go through.

It was not to be, and a campaign that brought the glory of the 4-1 thrashing of PSG in Newcastle's first Champions League game on home soil in two decades, ultimately came up short with key moments being a crucial home defeat to Dortmund, that fateful penalty in Paris and this loss to Milan.

They have acquitted themselves well despite finishing bottom of their group, but this has been a brutal learning experience.

Howe must lift broken Newcastle

There was the sound of silence and a sense of disbelief for just a few seconds as the grim realisation of Newcastle's elimination from European football sank in.

Newcastle had high hopes that the cards could fall in a way which would allow them to enjoy the prestige and financial firepower of the Champions League knockout phase. Instead they were beaten and looked broken after a chastening week.

They have been overpowered by Everton and Tottenham before losing to Milan in what was, at first, a smash-and-grab but ended with the Italians squandering chances, hitting the post twice as Newcastle chased an unlikely outcome.

Newcastle also looked, as they had done in those Premier League matches, exhausted at the final whistle.

Howe now has the task of lifting a leg-weary squad short on numbers because of injuries, into a position where they can sample this challenge next season - and show they have learned from it - by finishing in the Premier League's top four.

There was no consolation in the manner of Newcastle's demise. Now Howe faces a huge challenge to lift their spirits.

Warren Zaire-Emery demonstrated his outstanding talent in a performance capped by his first Champions League goal

Paris St-Germain scraped through to the Champions League knockout phase after 17-year-old Warren Zaire-Emery's goal earned a priceless draw at already-qualified Borussia Dortmund.

With Newcastle and AC Milan ready to pounce on a slip-up by PSG, Dortmund led when Karim Adeyemi steered in.

But Zaire-Emery drilled home five minutes later and it was enough to put the French champions into the last 16.

PSG's spot was secured by Milan fighting back to win at Newcastle.

German side Dortmund finished top of Group F with 11 points, while PSG join them in the pot for Monday's draw after ending up with eight points.

PSG have long targeted winning the Champions League as a symbolic triumph of their transformation under Qatari ownership, and this result ensures their place in the knockout stages for a 12th successive season.

However, winning the trophy has continued to elude them. The nearest the Parisians have come to achieving their ultimate goal was four seasons ago when they lost to Bayern Munich in the 2020 final.

While they have been shorn of mercurially-talented pair Neymar and Lionel Messi this season, PSG still can rely on Kylian Mbappe to provide match-defining moments as they aim to finally win Europe's premier club competition.

Only an incredible sliding block from Dortmund defender Niklas Sule stopped Mbappe putting the French side ahead before the break, while Bradley Barcola hit the post and Randal Kolo Muani twice fired wide in one-on-ones with Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel.

Dortmund also had chances through Marco Reus and Adeyemi in an entertaining first half which somehow remained goalless.

Adeyemi made amends for his glaring miss when he swept in Niclas Fullkrug's pass shortly after the restart and, with Newcastle beating Milan, PSG were on course to face a chastening group-stage exit.

But Mbappe's brilliance helped get them back level in Dortmund and ultimately keep their Champions League dream alive.

The 24-year-old France forward used his sharp movement and trickery to stretch the Dortmund defence, who could not clear their lines and allowed Zaire-Emery to fire in the equaliser.

Mbappe also had what could have been the winner - another run and precise finish - ruled out by the tightest of offside calls.

With news filtering through about Milan's fightback, the pace slowed down as both Dortmund and PSG saw out a draw which suited both teams.","Last updated on .From the section European FootballWarren Zaire-Emery demonstrated his outstanding talent in a performance capped by his first Champions League goalParis St-Germain scraped through to the Champions League knockout phase after 17-year-old Warren Zaire-Emery's goal earned a priceless draw at already-qualified Borussia Dortmund.

Rahm won this year's Masters and the 2021 US Open

LIV Golf chief executive Greg Norman says there will be ""more apples falling from the tree"" following Jon Rahm's decision to join the Saudi-funded tour.

Rahm announced he would be leaving the PGA Tour for LIV earlier this month.

The move represented a huge U-turn for the two-time major winner, who had previously ruled out joining LIV since its inaugural season in 2022.

""To have Jon on board was critically important to our future and what we want to do,"" Norman said.

Speaking to World Business Report, Norman added: ""It will create a domino effect, there will be more apples falling from the tree - no question about it, because LIV continues to develop.""

Rahm, 29, said in 2022 that LIV's three-day events, with shotgun starts and no cut, were ""not appealing"" and he was chasing a golfing legacy over money.

However, the Spaniard now joins other major winners on the breakaway tour including Brooks Koepka, who won this year's US PGA Championship, 2022 Open champion Cam Smith and six-time major winner Phil Mickelson.

Rahm is reportedly set to earn upwards of Â£450m external-link ($566.4m) as part of his switch.

Norman said Rahm's move has caused other players to consider signing for LIV.

""Since Jon signed, less than a week ago now, I know my phone is blowing up,"" Norman said.

""I know we probably have eight to 12 players who are very, very keen to sit down and talk to us about coming on board.""

However, Norman said he has not tried to get world number two Rory McIlroy, a staunch opponent of LIV, on board.

Critics say Saudi Arabia's unprecedented spending on sport has been used to improve the oil-producing kingdom's reputation over its human rights record and its environmental impact.

Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia's sports minister said claims of sportswashing against the country are ""very shallow"".

Australian Norman, a two-time major winner, said Saudi Arabia ""really cares"" about golf, adding that the animosity LIV has faced since its inception has been ""disappointing"".

""If you see the way they're embracing the game of golf, they're investing in the game of golf in their country for their people into the future,"" he said.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that 21 golfers playing for the PGA Tour have written a letter demanding more information about the organisation's future.

In June 2023, the PGA and DP World Tours announced they had a ""framework agreement"" to merge with the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has pledged $2bn (Â£1.6bn) of support to LIV.

That agreement has a deadline of 31 December 2023 to be ratified, although the American government is examining the PGA Tour's plans to take massive investment from Saudi Arabia.

Norman said he did not believe the merger would fall through, adding golf has been recognised as an asset because of LIV.","Rahm announced he would be leaving the PGA Tour for LIV earlier this month.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67699481,Red Star Belgrade 2-3 Man City: Micah Hamilton and Oscar Bobb score first goals for City in Champions League,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Micah Hamilton became the youngest English player (20 years, 30 days) to score on his Champions League debut since Marcus Rashford in 2017 for Manchester United (19 years, 316 days)

Winger Micah Hamilton scored on a dream Manchester City debut as he helped his side beat Red Star Belgrade and reach the Champions League last 16 with a 100% record.

Hamilton, 20, has been with the club since the age of nine and put City ahead after 19 minutes in a hostile atmosphere in Serbia.

Matheus Nunes found him down the right wing and Hamilton, who has represented England at under-16 level, got into the penalty area and shifted the ball to create space before powerfully firing into the roof of the net.

On a great night for City's academy, 20-year-old Oscar Bobb also scored his first goal for the club with a jinking run at the home defence, before curling in the second on 63 minutes.

Hwang In-beom pulled one back for Red Star when he got free of marker Kalvin Phillips and shot low past Stefan Ortega.

But Phillips made amends when he converted a penalty, after the impressive Hamilton had been fouled.

Aleksandar Katai headed in a late second for Red Star, but European champions City were not to be denied and follow in the footsteps of Real Madrid to advance into the last 16 with six wins from six group matches.

Pep Guardiola's side become only the second English team to achieve this, after Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in 2021-22.

The draw for the last 16 will be held at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland at 11:00 GMT on Monday, 18 December.

City will face one of the sides to have progressed as group runners-up, with one of their potential opponents being Inter Milan - the team they beat in last season's final.

From ball boy to Champions League goalscorer

City boss Guardiola was delighted with Hamilton's performance and said: ""What a goal and what a game.

""I'm so happy for him. He's training often with us and we saw his skills one against one. He scored a fantastic goal and made a penalty.""

During the match, footage from September 2017 emerged on social media showing Guardiola talking to a then 13-year-old Hamilton, who was a ball boy during City's 5-0 win over Crystal Palace.

Hamilton said it felt ""surreal"" to now be scoring for the club and was excited for his future.

""The manager has given us the opportunity in training and in the game. Playing with the best players, you always improve,"" said Hamilton.

""He put me on the right wing, something different for me. I'd not really played there. I saw it as a challenge and I took it and I enjoyed every moment.

""It's definitely just the start and [I want] to kick on from here.""

Youngsters seize chance to shine

Having won their opening five group matches, City were already guaranteed to finish top of Group G to give Guardiola the luxury of being able to make changes in their penultimate match before flying to Saudi Arabia to play in the Club World Cup.

Only Mateo Kovacic and Jack Grealish remained from the XI that began the 2-1 win over Luton, with goalkeeper Ederson rested and top goalscorer Erling Haaland still unavailable because of a foot injury.

Hamilton's inclusion was the main headline, while attacking midfielder Bobb made his first start in the Champions League.

England midfielder Phillips was named in the first XI for only the second time this season, having played in City's 1-0 loss to Newcastle in the third round of the Carabao Cup in September.

Last week Guardiola apologised to Phillips for not giving him more time on the pitch, while also praising his professionalism despite struggling to regularly feature following his Â£45m move from Leeds in July 2022.

Phillips responded with a hard-working, efficient performance in the heart of City's midfield that saw him score their third from the penalty spot, though he did pick up a booking in the second half and failed to track Hwang's run for Red Star's first goal.

But Guardiola's main source of pride would have been the performances of his younger players, with 18-year-old defensive midfielder Mahamadou Susoho also making his debut as a second-half substitute.

Manchester City are the first English team to have two players aged under the age of 21 (Micah Hamilton and Oscar Bobb, pictured) score on their first Champions League starts in the same game

Hamilton nearly got his second goal, but curled a shot just wide and also nearly set up Bobb but the Norwegian, at full stretch, could not get on the end of a teasing low cross across the face of goal.

Bobb was not to be denied as he took on a number of defenders before a sublime finish to double City's lead.

Red Star, European champions in 1991, lost 3-1 in September's reverse fixture in Manchester and were already guaranteed to finish bottom of the group.

Back-up City goalkeeper Ortega made two excellent saves in quick succession to deny Peter Olayinka and Guelor Kanga, but conceded twice in the last 14 minutes - either side of Phillips' penalty.

Guardiola felt the performance was another sign of how strong the club's youth set-up is.

""Congratulations to all at the academy for the last years,"" added Guardiola. ""How many players came up, how many players we sold who are playing already in the Premier League and Championship, and more?

""It is not easy to give opportunities at this level. It is really good to see them play.

""I'm very pleased for the result, for the performance in general, the effort from everyone, how the seniors helped the young lads.""

Sergio Perez, Christian Horner and Max Verstappen were greeted by 2,000 Red Bull staff at a Milton Keynes homecoming parade

Team principal Christian Horner says he does not believe Red Bull's 2023 season will be repeated in his lifetime.

Max Verstappen won his third world title in October and recorded 19 victories.

Sergio Perez won twice as Red Bull clinched 21 wins from 22 races to claim back-to-back constructors' crowns.

The Singapore Grand Prix was Red Bull's only defeat and Horner thinks the only way to improve next season is to win the ""missing race"".

""This season, I doubt it will be repeated in my lifetime,"" the 50-year-old said at Red Bull's homecoming parade in Milton Keynes on Wednesday.

""It's the satisfaction of the whole thing coming together - all the departments.

""They have worked so hard, so tirelessly across all these races around the world with the challenges that are thrown at you - the different types of circuit, the different conditions, different strategies and to see us having come through that and won 21 of 22 races.""

Verstappen's victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix in July was Red Bull's 12th in a row and moved them past the 11 consecutive wins achieved by McLaren in 1988.

However, Horner does not believe his team will enjoy the same dominance next season.

""With such strong opposition as well, such strong teams and stable regulations - I am sure next year is going to be a lot closer, a lot tighter and a different kind of challenge,"" he said.

Red Bull and Mercedes are the only teams to have won Formula 1's constructors' title since 2010, but Mercedes' British drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell failed to win a race this season and the team finished 451 points behind Horner's.

""They are a great team - they have had a really dominant period, they are obviously having a tougher time at the moment, but I'm sure they will be coming back fully motivated next year we have no doubt about that,"" Horner said.

""I'm sure the rivalry intensity will be just as strong as ever.""","Last updated on .From the section Formula 1Sergio Perez, Christian Horner and Max Verstappen were greeted by 2,000 Red Bull staff at a Milton Keynes homecoming paradeTeam principal Christian Horner says he does not believe Red Bull's 2023 season will be repeated in his lifetime.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67699711,Man Utd 0-1 Bayern Munich: How United's worst-ever Champions League campaign unfolded,['Author not found'],"Manchester United conceded 15 goals from their six matches

Manchester United's return to the Champions League was part of the body of work that suggested Erik ten Hag was the transformative figure who had blown the cobwebs away from a dilapidated Old Trafford.

It was meant to be proof that United were back where they belonged after the missteps and misery of Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho - even though he won the League Cup and Europa League - and latterly Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

Ten Hag even had tangible success with a League Cup win in his first season, but if this wretched Champions League campaign has been any measure of the current status of Manchester United and their manager, the great transformer is now closer to being a busted flush.

This has been a shocking campaign, a chastening dose of cold reality that saw United finish bottom of a group they would have welcomed when the draw was made, fourth behind Bayern Munich, FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray.

The Champions League is the most unforgiving of environments. Every United flaw, and they are certainly not short of them, has been brutally exposed from the start.

And it all ended in the most timid of circumstances, a United side who should have come out swinging losing 1-0 to a Bayern side with nothing to play for, Ten Hag's players mustering a mere one shot on target in the process.

It was all a far cry from the Old Trafford nights of old when supporters were glued to their seats until the final whistle sounded.

Thousands of United fans had given up and left long before the end here and who could blame them?

Man Utd 0-1 Bayern Munich: Tuchel sympathises with Ten Hag

'United's Champions League comeback has been a shambles'

The statistics damn United and underline the lack of organisation, tactical acumen, nous and basic quality that have characterised their Champions League return and most of their season.

United's four points from six games is their lowest in any Champions League campaign, while the 15 goals conceded is the most by a Premier League side in any group stage of the competition.

All manner of inquests into this dismal failure can be conducted, but the bottom line is this Manchester United side are not fit for the purpose of success - a problem exacerbated by an uncanny knack of blasting themselves in both feet at the worst possible time.

Goalkeeper Andre Onana has had a nightmare campaign, at fault in the 4-3 loss away to Bayern, poor in the home defeat against Galatasaray then quite simply awful in the 3-3 draw with the Turkish side in Istanbul, gifting Hakim Ziyech two goals from routine free-kicks. That was a result that ensured even victory here against Bayern might not have been enough for United.

As it was, United never even threatened to keep their own side of the bargain.

Few tears were shed when goalkeeper David de Gea left United after 12 years last summer, but Onana has done nothing to suggest the Spaniard has been adequately replaced.

United held a two-goal lead before losing 4-3 in Copenhagen and twice held a similar advantage before sharing the points when visiting Galatasaray.

There was a lack of discipline as Marcus Rashford was sent off with United 2-0 up in Denmark, the inexplicable catalyst for a collapse from a position of control to another damaging defeat.

All in all, United's Champions League comeback has been a shambles.

Old rivals Bayern put them out of their misery. In reality, United's Champions League return was probably washed up even before a ball was kicked on a miserable, forgettable occasion.

Bayern didn't even have to break sweat

On a night when United needed to at least show a willing to save themselves, they managed five shots in all. Five shots on a night when victory was a must.

Yes, a first-half groin injury for captain Harry Maguire and a hamstring problem that meant Luke Shaw could not come out for the second half hampered their efforts, but there can be no excuses. This is a desperately poor team when set against the standards Manchester United aspire to.

The loss of Maguire and Shaw added to an admittedly very lengthy injury list but this Champions League exit has been long in the making and on this night questions had to be asked. Where was the urgency? Where was the intensity? Where was the creation? Where was the belief? Nowhere to be seen.

This was not even a classic Bayern side. Good but not great - certainly not a team you would risk a huge amount on in terms of them winning the Champions League.

Bayern, however, were still able to deal with United without breaking sweat in a game that was actually neither here nor there for Thomas Tuchel's team. You were left with the impression that if there had suddenly been something riding on this for the Bundesliga champions they would have been able to slip through the gears and dismiss United without too much fuss.

If there were any flashes of pace and urgency, they actually came from the side that did not even need to show it.

The home fans were remarkably patient given the meagre fare on offer. The jeers at the final whistle were more in resignation than anger.

United have proved a few things throughout this ill-fated campaign. None of them good.

Finishing bottom of the group 'the right outcome'

Manchester United have proved that for now they do not belong in this elite company. Their final position in Group A does not do them a disservice. It is the right outcome. They proved the likes of Bayern, Manchester City and Real Madrid are out of their league.

And at the heart of it all is Ten Hag, facing an increasing struggle to tame this unwieldy football beast, looking more and more like a manager who is sinking, scrambling to make sense of how those slivers of optimism from last season have been so quickly replaced by despair and despondency.

Ten Hag must seek improvement in another unforgiving environment, at Anfield on Sunday against Premier League leaders Liverpool, who inflicted a historic 7-0 thrashing on United last season.

And he will almost certainly have to do it without the injured Shaw and Maguire, along with injured captain Bruno Fernandes.

If United hoped coming back to the Champions League stage would offer confirmation that they were edging back towards the top table, the fact they were not even good enough to secure the safety net of consolation offered up by the Europa League tells them exactly where they actually stand.","The Champions League is the most unforgiving of environments.
