Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says.

The official said the case was ""against our rules of engagement"" and an investigation was happening at the ""highest level"".

The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in Shejaiya on Friday.

Israeli troops have been facing stiff resistance in the area near Gaza City.

The case has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for the release of the more than 120 captives who remain in Gaza.

The wait of their families has gripped Israel, as the military carries out its offensive against Hamas.

Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no let-up in the Israeli operations.

""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing,"" he said.

Hamas, for its part, said it had told mediators there would be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"".

An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an initial investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) suggested the three hostages emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.

One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.

A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.

The hostages had either been abandoned by their captors or escaped, the official added.

A building with a message SOS was found in the area, and the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to the killed hostages.

Meanwhile Wichian Temthong, a freed Thai hostage who was held with the three men, recalled his time with them, saying that, as they had no common language they used hand signals to communicate and give each other moral support. He was ""very shocked"" and ""saddened"" to learn of the deaths of the men he spent nearly 50 days in captivity with, he said.

Hostages' relatives are keeping up pressure on the Israeli government

Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, the families have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

In Tel Aviv, thousands of people gathered outside the city's Museum of Art, in what is now known as Hostages Square, and called for a truce, chanting ""Bring them home now"".

""It's our biggest fear what happened - hostages who were alive are now dead,"" Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky is a hostage, said at the vigil. ""We don't need bodies, or bags. Make a ceasefire until all hostages are back, alive. Every day that passes by we're just discovering more and more names of hostages that were taken alive and are now coming back dead.""

The war in Gaza, launched in response to the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in Israel, has killed more than 18,000 people, according to the local health authorities, and pushed hundreds of thousands of others from their homes.

Vast areas of the territory have been destroyed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies.

Israeli authorities say the offensive's goal is to destroy Hamas and release the hostages.

Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US, but they have resisted calls for a ceasefire.

Mr Netanyahu deflected the pressure again on Saturday.

""Despite grief, despite international pressure, we continue until the end, nothing will stop us,"" he said.","Israel Gaza: Hostages were carrying white cloth when shot, IDF saysBy Hugo Bachega BBC Middle East Correspondent, Tel AvivHostage and Missing Families ForumLeft to right: Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer TalalkaThree Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says.

Migrant boats in the Mediterranean (file pic) are often overcrowded and unstable

More than 60 migrants are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

Citing survivors, the UN agency said on Saturday the vessel left the city of Zuwara with around 86 people on board.

It said high waves swamped the boat and that 61 migrants, including children, were missing and presumed dead.

Libya is among the main departure points for migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and enter Europe.

The IOM estimates that more than 2,200 people have drowned while attempting the crossing this year alone, making it one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.

The agency said most of the victims of the latest incident were from Nigeria, Gambia, and other African countries, the AFP news agency reports.

It also said 25 survivors had been transferred to a Libyan detention centre and were being given medical support.

Writing on X, formerly Twitter, an IOM spokesperson called the death toll for this year a ""dramatic number which unfortunately demonstrates that not enough is being done to save lives at sea"".

In June, at least 78 people died and another 100 were rescued after a fishing boat sank off southern Greece.

The Mediterranean crossings frequently see scores of migrants crowded onto boats too small to safely hold them.

Those making the trip are typically hoping to land in Italy before making their way to other countries in Europe, some escaping conflict or persecution, others in search of work.","More than 60 migrants feared drowned off Libya, IOM saysReutersMigrant boats in the Mediterranean (file pic) are often overcrowded and unstableMore than 60 migrants are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

By Alys Davies BBC News

PA Media

UK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby.

The Liberal Democrat says her family are ""days away from dying"" without access to water or food.

Her relatives and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem say a mother and daughter were killed inside the Holy Family Church complex on Saturday by sniper fire.

The BBC has asked the IDF for comment.

The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent.

""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday.

The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents.""

The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said.

Members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - are Christian Palestinians who sought refuge inside the church after their home was bombed in the first week of the war.

They have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in rooms in the Holy Family Church for more than 60 days.

""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" Ms Moran told the BBC.

They have been keeping in touch with Ms Moran and other family members sporadically through WhatsApp messages and calls - though they have no internet and power is intermittent.

A sixth member of the family - a grandfather - died last month after not being able to get to hospital to receive medical treatment, Ms Moran says.

The five remaining members say they now no longer have access to food or water, and the last remaining generator - which was pumping water from wherever they could get it - has stopped working in the church.

They say soldiers entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and took over a room in a building.

Earlier in the week, the family heard shots being fired and saw bullet casings in the church compound. They say two men were killed on Tuesday while they were coming and going from the building - a bin collector and a janitor.

The family have sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying on a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying outside for days. The BBC has not verified the circumstances of what the image shows.

Ms Moran says there has been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers would target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there.

""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" Ms Moran adds.

Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group.

Early on in the war Israel told people in northern Gaza to move to southern Gaza for their safety. It has also paused military activity in some areas for short periods to allow people to leave. There was also a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow a swap of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

However Israel has also bombed southern Gaza, where it told people to go, and a large number of Palestinians have remained in Gaza City and other northern areas.

Ms Moran says she has been in touch with a number of countries about getting her relatives out of Gaza, but the situation is ""incredibly complex"".

She adds that the family have considered trying to travel to Rafah in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt but say it is too dangerous while no ceasefire is in place.

Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during the brief truce.","UK MP Layla Moran's family among hundreds trapped in Gaza churchBy Alys Davies BBC NewsPA MediaUK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby.

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Taiwan

Chips have driven Taiwan's astonishing economic success

When 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world.

He grew up in a fishing village surrounded by sugarcane fields. He had attended university in Taiwan's capital Taipei, then a city of dusty streets and grey apartment buildings where people rarely owned cars.

Now he was off to Princeton University. The US had just a put a man on the Moon and the Boeing 747 in the skies. Its economy was larger than those of the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany and France combined.

""When I landed, I was shocked,"" Dr Shih, now 77, says. ""I thought to myself: Taiwan is so poor, I must do something to try and help make it better off.""

And he did. Dr Shih and a group of young, ambitious engineers transformed an island that exported sugar and t-shirts into an electronics powerhouse.

Today's Taipei is rich and hip. High-speed trains zip passengers along the west coast of the island at 350km/h (218mph). Taipei 101 - briefly the tallest building in the world - towers over the city, an emblem of its prosperity.

Much of that is down to a tiny device no larger than a fingernail. The silicon semiconductor - wafer-thin and best-known now as a chip - sits at the heart of every technology we use, from iPhones to airplanes.

Taiwan now makes more than half the chips that power our lives. Its biggest manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is the ninth-most valuable business in the world.

That makes Taiwan nearly irreplaceable - and vulnerable. China, fearing it could be cut off from the most advanced chips, is spending billions to steal Taiwan's crown. Or it could take the island, as it has repeatedly threatened to do.

But Taiwan's path to chip superstardom will not be easy to replicate - the island has a secret sauce, honed through decades of laborious work by its engineers. Plus, the manufacturing relies on a web of economic ties that the escalating US-China rivalry is now trying to undo.

Sugar to silicon

When Dr Shih arrived at Princeton, ""the US was just beginning the semiconductor revolution"", he says.

It had just been a decade since Robert Noyce made the ""monolithic integrated circuit"", packing electronic components onto a single wafer of silicon - an early version of the microchip which kickstarted the personal computer revolution.

Dr Shih Chin-tay led Taiwan's foray into chip manufacturing in the 1970s

For the two years after Dr Shih graduated, he designed memory chips at Burroughs Corporation, second then to IBM in computer-making.

At the time, Taiwan was hunting for a new national industry following an oil crisis that had pummelled its exports. Silicon seemed like a possibility - and Dr Shih thought he could help: ""I thought it was time to come home.""

In the late 1970s, he joined Taiwan's best and brightest electrical engineers at a new research lab - the staid-sounding Industrial Technology Research Institute would play an outsized role in recasting the island's economy.

Work began in Hsinchu, a small city south of Taipei - today it's a global electronics hub, dominated by TSMC's enormous fabrication plants. These chip factories, each the size of several football fields, are some of the cleanest places on earth. The finer manufacturing details are a well-guarded secret, and no outside cameras are allowed.

The newest factory - the nearly $20bn fab 18 in southern Taiwan - will soon start producing three-nanometre chips destined for next-generation iPhones.

All of this is far beyond what Dr Shih and his colleagues imagined when they opened an experimental factory in the 1970s. They were hopeful because they had technology licensed from a major US electronics maker - but to everyone's surprise, the factory outperformed its parent. It's hard to explain why and, to this day, the precise formula for Taiwan's success remains elusive.

Dr Shih's recollection is more prosaic: ""Output was better than the original RCA plant, with lower costs. So, this gave the government confidence that maybe we really could do something.""

The Taiwanese government put up the initial capital - first for the United Micro-electronics Corporation, and then in 1987 for what would become the world's biggest chip factory - TSMC.

Shih Chin-tay (second from left at the back) along with other engineers in 1977, soon after returning to Taiwan

To run it, they recruited Morris Chang, a Chinese-American engineer and former executive at US electronics giant Texas Instruments. It was a stroke of luck or genius, or both - today the 93-year-old is known as the father of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.

Back then, he quickly realised that taking on US and Japanese giants at their own game was a losing proposition. Instead TSMC would only manufacture chips for others, and not design its own.

This ""foundry model"", which was unheard of in 1987, changed the landscape of the industry and paved the way for Taiwan to become the pack leader.

And the timing couldn't have been better. Silicon Valley's new crop of start-ups - Apple, AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia - did not have the funds to build fab plants of their own. And they would struggle to find manufacturers for the chips that they couldn't function without.

""They would have to go to leading semi-conductor companies and ask if they had any excess production capacity they could use,"" Dr Shih says. ""But then TSMC came along.""

Now California's ""fabless"" companies could partner with Taiwan's chip makers, who had no interest in stealing their designs or competing with them.

""Rule number one at TSMC is don't compete with your customers,"" Dr Shih says.

The secret sauce

The world produces more than a trillion chips a year. A modern car has anywhere between 1,500 to 3,000 chips. The iPhone 12 reportedly had around 1,400 semiconductors. A shortfall in 2022, driven by soaring demand for electronics during the pandemic, hit sales of washing machines and BMWs alike.

Taiwan's extraordinary success - the island ships more than half of those trillion-plus chips, and nearly all of the most advanced ones - has been driven by its mastery of volume. In other words, Taiwanese manufacturing is incredibly efficient.

Making silicon chips is expensive and painstaking. It starts off with a large ingot of ultra-pure silicon grown from a single crystal. Each ingot may take several days to grow and could weigh up to 100kg.

Morris Chang introduced the foundry model, making Taiwan the world's chip factory

After a diamond cutter slices the slab into skinny wafers, a machine uses light to etch tiny circuits onto each wafer. A single wafer may contain hundreds of microprocessors, and billions of circuits.

What matters eventually is the yield - the area of each wafer that is usable as a chip. In the 1970s US companies had yields as low as 10% and, at best, 50%. By the 1980s the Japanese were averaging at 60%. TSMC has reportedly surpassed them all with a yield that hovers around 80%.

Over time Taiwanese manufacturers have managed to cram more and more circuits into mind-bogglingly smaller spaces. Using the latest extreme-ultraviolet light lithography machines, TSMC can etch 100 billion circuits on to a single microprocessor, or over 100 million circuits per square millimetre.

Why are Taiwanese companies so good at this? No-one seems to know exactly why.

Dr Shih thinks it's simple: ""We had brand new facilities, with the most up-to-date equipment. We recruited the best engineers. Even the machine operators were highly skilled. And then we didn't just import technology, we absorbed the lessons from our American teachers and applied continuous improvement.""

A young man who spent several years working at one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies agrees: ""I think Taiwan's companies are bad at making big breakthroughs in technology. But they are very good at taking someone else's idea and making it better. This can be done by trial and error, continuously tweaking small things.""

This is important because in a semiconductor fab the machines need to be constantly calibrated. Making microchips is engineering. But it's also more than that. Some have likened it to cooking - like a gourmet feast. Give two chefs the same recipe and ingredients - the better cook will make the better dish.

In other words, Taiwan has a secret sauce.

Getty Images

Where it all began: TSMC's headquarters in the Hsinchu Science Park

But the young man, who did not want to reveal his name, or that of the company, says Taiwanese companies have another advantage.

""Compared to software engineers in the US, even at the best companies here, engineers are paid quite badly,"" he said. ""But compared to other industries in Taiwan the pay is good. So, if you work for a big electronic company after a few years, you'll be able to get a mortgage, buy a car. You'll be able to get married. So, people suck it up.""

He described a six-day week which began each day with a meeting at 07:30 and would usually last until 19:00. He would also be called in on Sundays or holidays if there was a problem at the plant.

""If people weren't willing to do the job the company would be finished. It's because people are willing to put up with hardship that these companies succeed.""

The silicon shield

In December 2022 TSMC broke ground on a $40bn plant in the US state of Arizona. It was hailed by President Joe Biden as a sign that high-tech manufacturing was returning to American soil.

Since then the headlines have been somewhat less cheery.

They Wouldn't Listen To Us: Inside Arizona's Troubled Chip Plant, read one. Another said, TSMC Struggles To Recruit Workers While Facing Pushback From Unions.

Chip production was supposed to start next year. Now it's been put back to 2025.

Former TSMC chairman Dr Chang was deeply sceptical from the start. Last year he described expanding chip production in the US as an ""expensive, wasteful exercise in futility"" because manufacturing chips in the US would be 50% more expensive than in Taiwan. But Taiwan's chip-making prowess has put it at the centre of the tech war between the US and China.

Washington wants to prevent Taiwan supplying China with the cutting-edge chips it fears Beijing will use to accelerate its weapons programs and advance its artificial intelligence.

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which strangled Europe's gas supply, US politicians are jittery about Taiwan. They fear that the huge concentration of high-end chip production on the island makes the US economy hostage to a Chinese invasion.

But Taiwanese companies see little economic advantage in moving production off the island. They are doing so reluctantly under political pressure.

People in Taiwan resent the idea that they should be blamed for their success - and that Taiwan should voluntarily weaken what many regard as its ""silicon shield"", while the rest of the world vacillates over whether the island and its democratic society is worth protecting from Chinese aggression.

Taipei 101 towers over the island's wealthy capital

Dr Shih says those who are seeking to forcibly restructure global chip production misunderstand its success.

""If you look at the history of semiconductors, no one country dominates this industry,"" he says. ""Taiwan may dominate the manufacturing sector. But there is a very long supply chain and innovation from every part of it contributes to the growth of the industry. ""

Much of the world's raw silicon comes from China, although most of it goes to the solar industry. Germany and Japan lead the charge in chemicals that are necessary to process the wafers.

Carl Zeiss, a German optoelectronics company better known for making eyewear and camera lenses, produces optical devices that go into the lithography machines made by a leading Dutch company, ASML. The laborious manufacturing works to designs that originate in American companies or the UK-based Arm.

Dr Shih is doubtful Beijing can recreate this supply chain - from materials to design to high-end production - inside China.

""If they want to create a different model then I wish them luck,"" he says with a shrug. ""Because if you really want innovation, you need everyone to work together from all around the world. It's not one company or one country.""

He is just as doubtful about cutting China out as the US has been doing.

""I think that's probably a major mistake,"" he says. ""When I look back, I feel lucky to have witnessed the extraordinary growth of Taiwan's economy and this long period of peace. Now I see conflict in other parts of the world, and I worry it may come to Asia.","The secret sauce for Taiwan's chip superstardomBy Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, TaiwanGetty ImagesChips have driven Taiwan's astonishing economic successWhen 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world.

By Frank Gardner BBC Security Correspondent in Jerusalem

The disastrous incident in which Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, mistaking them for Hamas fighters despite their waving a white cloth, is a graphic illustration of the risks involved in armed hostage rescue.

Maj Gen Charlie Herbert, a retired British Army general who served on 13 operational tours including Iraq and Afghanistan, told the BBC: ""As desperately sad as it is, the shooting dead of the three hostages... again calls into question IDF tactics, proportionality and distinction. One can only imagine how many civilians have been killed in similar circumstances.""

The IDF says it takes great care to avoid harming civilians, but the horrific death toll in Gaza - more than 18,000 and rising - has caused Israel to be accused of indiscriminate bombing.

In nearly every case of kidnap in history, those abducted stand a far better chance of emerging alive and unscathed through mediation and a deal, rather than by armed intervention.

One of the first hostage cases I covered was when Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in Yemen abducted 16 Western tourists in 1998. The British ambassador went to see the interior minister to press for a negotiated release of the hostages. Too late, he was told, the Yemeni army has already gone in. A quarter of those kidnapped were killed in the ensuing firefight, with others injured.

Western and Israeli special forces have spent decades perfecting the art of hostage rescue, but even then it doesn't always go to plan. Israel's Operation Thunderbolt in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976 rescued 102 of the 106 hostages, but the commander of the Israeli commandos was killed. Today his brother, Benjamin Netanyahu, is prime minister.

Killed by the IDF by mistake: (L-R) Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer Talalka

The 1980 SAS siege of the Iranian embassy in London is perhaps the most iconic hostage rescue of modern times, as it took place in the full glare of the TV cameras.

When a British journalist, Stephen Farrell, was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2009 he was rescued by British Special Forces. But the raid also resulted in the deaths of one of his rescuers, two civilians and his Afghan interpreter.

The following year a US Navy SEAL team attempted to rescue the British aid worker Linda Norgrove, also kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The raid killed her kidnappers but she died from a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers.

In 2012 a British Special Forces operation to free one British and one Italian hostage in Nigeria was ruined when one of the Nigerian soldiers fired his weapon prematurely, alerting the kidnappers who then murdered their captives.

Many hostage cases in Yemen have been resolved peacefully over the years, usually through lengthy tribal negotiations accompanied by interminable narcotic qat-chewing sessions. But ultimately, much depends on the demands and intentions of the kidnappers.

In the case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State group (IS), the jihadist kidnappers never really had any intention of releasing their US and British captives. Instead they were aiming for maximum psychological impact by killing them on camera. In those situations, armed intervention, if they can be located, is usually the only option available.

Sharon Avigdori, seen hugging her husband, is among more than 100 hostages released after being abducted and taken to Gaza by Hamas

Hamas is something of a hybrid case. The atrocities committed in their raid into southern Israel on 7 October were gratuitously cruel and violent. Yet they have subsequently been willing to bargain the release of more than 100 hostages.

Today, Israel's hostage relatives are all too aware that nearly all those already released won their freedom not by daring military action but by painstaking negotiations and mediation by Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States. To date, only one Israeli hostage, Private Ori Megedish, has been rescued by force.

But doing a deal with kidnappers, especially those considered by many governments to be terrorists, can be a bitter pill to swallow. Hostage-takers will demand something in return.

In the case of Hamas, that has meant releasing large numbers of prisoners from Israeli jails, pausing the fighting and significantly increasing the amount of aid getting into Gaza.","Israel Gaza: The perils of hostage rescueBy Frank Gardner BBC Security Correspondent in JerusalemEPAThe disastrous incident in which Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, mistaking them for Hamas fighters despite their waving a white cloth, is a graphic illustration of the risks involved in armed hostage rescue.

He was on trial with nine other defendants. All were convicted on some counts and found not guilty on others.

The trial, which exposed infighting and intrigue in the highest Vatican ranks, had been going on for two-and-a-half years.

After three judges spent more than five hours considering the verdict, Court President Giuseppe Pignatone announced that Cardinal Becciu had been convicted of embezzlement.

The others, who included financiers, lawyers and ex-Vatican employees, were accused of various crimes, including fraud, money laundering and abuse of office. They all denied wrongdoing.

""We reaffirm Cardinal Angelo Becciu's innocence and will appeal,"" stated Becciu's lawyer, Fabio Viglione, after the verdict. ""We respect the ruling, but we will definitely appeal.""

The case - the first of a Cardinal standing trial in a Vatican court - was the stuff of intrigue and skulduggery. It involved allegations of financial impropriety at the top of the Vatican, cloak-and-dagger activity of the kind that has often characterised the secretive world of the Holy See.

It centred around a building not in the Vatican, or even in Rome, but a thousand kilometres away in London - 60 Sloane Avenue in affluent Chelsea, a former warehouse belonging to the department store Harrod's.

Cardinal Becciu (L) had been a close adviser to Pope Francis

In 2014, the Vatican spent more than €200m ($220m; £170m) acquiring a 45% stake in the building, which was planned to be converted into luxury apartments. By 2018, the Vatican's Secretariat of State had decided to buy the property outright, sinking a further €150m euros into the purchase. Allegedly signing off on the whole deal was Cardinal Becciu, who was at the time the Vatican's Substitute for General Affairs - in effect chief of staff to the Pope.

The money, part of which was intended to be used for charitable works, had been paid into a trust run by a London-based Italian financier Raffaele Mincione, who orchestrated the purchase. When the Secretariat later sought financial help from the Vatican's own bank, it sparked concern - and a raid by Vatican police that led to the charges against Becciu, Mincione, and eight others.

But the investigation into Becciu's affairs wasn't limited to the London property deal.

The cardinal was also accused of funnelling vast sums of money to his home diocese of Sardinia, some of which reportedly benefited his family. And it was alleged he paid almost €600,000 to another of the accused, Cecilia Marogna, to help free a nun kidnapped in Mali. Prosecutors said she instead spent much of the money on luxury goods and holidays. Marogna, who had offered her services to the Vatican as an intelligence expert, visited Becciu's residence on several occasions. Both denied claims of a sexual relationship.

The charges against Becciu made him the first cardinal ever tried for financial crimes. It also prompted Pope Francis to strip him of rights including that of voting in a future conclave to select Francis's successor.

After he was removed from office by the Pope in 2020, he gave a news conference to plead his innocence.

""Until 6:02 p.m. on Thursday I felt like a friend of the Pope, a faithful executor of his will,"" Cardinal Becciu said. ""Then the Pope says he no longer has faith in me.""

By Emily Atkinson BBC News

Ministry of Defence

The Destroyer HMS Diamond only recently arrived in the region

A British warship has shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, the defence secretary has said.

HMS Diamond, a Type 45 Destroyer, successfully destroyed the target on Saturday, Grant Shapps said.

The Ministry of Defence said it was the first time in decades the Royal Navy had shot an aerial target in anger.

The MoD did not say who was behind the incident, but Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for recent attacks in the Red Sea.

The Houthis have targeted foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. They have declared support for Hamas and have said they were targeting ships travelling to Israel.

Merchant shipping was believed to be the drone's intended target in Saturday's incident, the defence secretary said.

The Red Sea lies between north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and connects the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal.

HMS Diamond was sent to the region just two weeks ago ""to bolster international efforts to maintain maritime security"", Mr Shapps said in a statement.

The defence secretary said the attacks represented ""a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security"" in the Red Sea.

""The UK remains committed to repelling these attacks to protect the free flow of global trade,"" he added.

Minstry of Defence

One Sea Viper missile fired and successfully destroyed the target, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said

Earlier this month, the US military said the Unity Explorer, sailing under the flag of the Bahamas and owned by a British company, was among three commercial vessels targeted in an attack by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

On Friday, shipping company Maersk told all its vessels planning to pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea to ""pause their journey until further notice"" after a missile attack on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship.

About 50 large merchant ships pass through the strait every day while double that number pass through the Strait of Hormuz.

According to the MoD, the last time the Royal Navy shot down an aerial target in anger was in the First Gulf War in 1991, when Type 42 Destroyer HMS Gloucester destroyed an Iraqi Silkworm missile bound for a US warship.

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key said: ""One sixth of the world's commercial shipping passes through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait and Red Sea.

""HMS Diamond deployed at short notice to the region from Portsmouth just two weeks ago and is already delivering effect together with our American, French and other allies and partners.","HMS Diamond: British warship shoots down suspected attack drone in Red SeaBy Emily Atkinson BBC NewsMinistry of DefenceThe Destroyer HMS Diamond only recently arrived in the regionA British warship has shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, the defence secretary has said.

The game was suspended in the 65th minute with the score at 1-1

Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer is ""stable"" after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch during the abandoned Premier League match at Bournemouth, his club confirmed.

Both sets of players were taken off midway through the second half as Lockyer received medical treatment.

The 29-year-old was responsive as he was carried off on a stretcher to applause and taken to hospital.

Luton said Lockyer was ""stable and currently undergoing further tests"".

""Our medical staff have confirmed that the Hatters captain [Tom Lockyer] suffered cardiac arrest on the pitch, but was responsive by the time he was taken off on the stretcher,"" Luton said.

""He received further treatment inside the stadium, for which we once again thank the medical teams from both sides.

""Tom was transferred to hospital, where we can reassure supporters that he is stable and currently undergoing further tests with his family at his bedside.""

Following confirmation the game was abandoned, both the Luton and Bournemouth players came back out on to the pitch to applaud the supporters, with Hatters manager Rob Edwards visibly emotional.

Lockyer collapsed during the play-off final win against Coventry in May before being taken to hospital.

He subsequently had heart surgery and was given the all-clear to return to playing in June.

The Premier League said in a statement: ""The match between AFC Bournemouth and Luton Town FC has been abandoned due to a player medical incident.

""Our thoughts are with Tom Lockyer and all players involved in today's match.""

Luton called for players, staff and supporters ""to come together"" in support of Lockyer and his family.

""We are sorry to all supporters present that players from both sides were in no state of mind to continue with the game after seeing their much-loved team-mate and friend taken off like that and staff could not carry on with managing the game in such circumstances,"" Luton said.

""We thank everyone for the wonderful applause and singing of Locks' [Lockyer's] name inside the stadium at such a difficult time.""

Bournemouth responded to Luton's update on Lockyer's condition, saying: ""We're relieved to hear Tom is responsive.""

The club added: ""Our thoughts will continue to be with Tom and his family at this time.

The world's largest shipping group, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has announced it is diverting its ships away from the Red Sea because of an increased threat of attacks.

French company CMA CGM took a similar step a day after Danish shipping giant Maersk and German transport company Hapag-Lloyd suspended Red Sea journeys.

The decision comes after attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

They say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel.

The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and saw 240 more taken hostage.

Since then, Israel has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza, Hamas health officials say.

The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments.

But the Houthis have been stepping up their attacks, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels.

They have also been firing drones and missiles towards Israel. The US said on Saturday its guided-missile destroyers had shot down 14 Houthi drones in the Red Sea.

In its announcement, MSC said the situation in the area had become ""serious"".

It said that its container ship MSC PALATIUM III was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship had been taken out of service.

Its ships were being re-routed via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa.

In its statement, CMA CGM - the world's third-largest shipping company - said it had instructed all its container ships there ""to reach safe areas and pause their journey in safe waters with immediate effect until further notice"".

Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, has described the situation as ""alarming"".

""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice,"" it told the BBC on Friday.

The four companies that have now suspended operations in the area comprise four of the top five in the world - and shipping experts say the decisions are going to be costly.

""It's security to the crew, to the ship itself and also insurance policies. Premiums are now going sky high if they can get insurance at all, so it's going to have serious implications on stock levels, on costs and the whole dynamics of supply chains,"" Sue Terpilowski from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, which represents companies concerned with supply chains, told the BBC.

The added crewing, fuel and insurance costs are all likely to be passed on to consumers, says BBC business reporter Vivienne Nunis.

The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate.

It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.

It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa.

About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year.

The funeral has been held of an Al Jazeera cameraman who was killed by an Israeli drone strike on Gaza.

Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh.

Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him.

The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an ""assassination"", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories.

The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996.

Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack.

During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would ""continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency"".

He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a ""human and noble message"" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks.

According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment.

Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces.

Al Jazeera said the cameraman was ""left to bleed to death for over five hours,"" adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families.

Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor.

He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis.

Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as ""a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling"".

""His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team,"" he said on X.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October.

By Rachelle Krygier BBC Monitoring, Miami

Reuters

Chileans are being asked to vote on a second draft for a new constitution after the first was rejected

Chileans are voting in a referendum to decide whether to adopt a new constitution to replace the one brought in under Gen Augusto Pinochet.

A previous draft put forward by an elected body dominated by left-wing delegates was rejected last year.

A constitutional council, this time dominated by right-wing delegates, has drafted a new, more conservative version.

But polls suggest Chileans remain divided on whether to approve it.

The drive for a new constitution started in 2019 after massive anti-government protests rocked Chile, which is normally seen as a haven of stability in the region.

The protesters, many of whom were left-wing students, demanded drastic social and political change.

After months of disruption, the conservative president at the time, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to launch a process to rewrite the 1980 constitution.

But the first draft, crafted by a constitutional convention chosen by voters, proved too radical for many.

Many balked at its sweeping reforms and its proposals to change many of the country's established institutions, such as replacing the 200-year-old Senate with a new Chamber of Regions.

It also proposed declaring Chile a ""plurinational state"", recognising the rights of Chile's indigenous groups - which make up about 13% of the population - to their lands and resources.

In September 2022 it was rejected by 62% of voters.

Reuters

Those who found the first draft too radical celebrated when it was rejected

A new constitutional council - this time made up of 24 individuals designated by Congress and 51 representatives elected by the Chilean people - was created to come up with a new draft.

It is this revised draft which Chileans have been asked to approve or reject this Sunday.

Opinion polls suggest that this second draft may also fail to get the backing necessary for it to come into force, with 46% telling pollsters they plan to vote against the draft and only 38% saying they will back it, with 16% still undecided.

While the first draft was widely criticised for being ""too far-left"", some voters have said that this second draft has veered too far to the right.

Socialist Party Senator Paulina Vodanovic warned that the new text represented ""a move backwards"" on many aspects of Chilean social and political life, such as gender issues. Other leftist critics argue that the revised proposal fails to adequately protect indigenous rights.

On the issue of abortion, for example, left-wing critics deem the proposed text too ambiguous and say it could allow future restrictions on existing reproductive rights.

Left-wing critics also dislike the weight given to private property rights and the fact that the new text enshrines private sector participation in the provision of basic services such as health, education or pensions.

Some describe it as being more conservative than the current constitution it aims to replace.

Proponents of the new draft say it gives individuals more choice by letting them decide if they prefer public or private providers for basic services.

Natalia González, a member of the constitutional council, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""If the state does it well, then they [the Chilean people] can opt for it, but if not, people don't have to remain captive. That freedom is protected in the new constitution.""

The far-right Republican party, which holds a majority of the seats on the constitutional council, is backing the new draft.

The party's leader and former presidential candidate, José Antonio Kast, urged ""us Chileans who last year voted 'reject', now have to vote in favour, in favour of change, in favour of improvement"".

The government of President Gabriel Boric, the left-wing former student leader who beat Mr Kast in 2021, has been accused by the opposition of openly promoting the ""reject"" option.

President Boric has already said that if the new draft is rejected, he will not push for another rewrite.","Chile votes on new conservative draft constitutionBy Rachelle Krygier BBC Monitoring, MiamiReutersChileans are being asked to vote on a second draft for a new constitution after the first was rejectedChileans are voting in a referendum to decide whether to adopt a new constitution to replace the one brought in under Gen Augusto Pinochet.

By James Gregory BBC News

BBC

Steve Coogan has campaigned for increased press regulation

A High Court ruling that Prince Harry's phone had been hacked by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) is the ""start of something"", actor Steve Coogan said.

Coogan said the ruling exposed ""widespread contempt"" by newspaper editors for the Leveson Inquiry, which looked at the ethics of the press.

He said the press needed to be held accountable with ""proper, independent regulation"".

Coogan was a victim of phone hacking by MGN and settled with the group in 2017.

The actor and comedian has long been an outspoken critic of sections of the tabloid press.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, won in relation to 15 articles published by MGN, with the judge finding evidence of ""widespread and habitual"" use of phone hacking at the group's newspapers.

Coogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What this shows is the contempt that newspaper editors had for a judge-led public inquiry.

""Now we've got prima facia evidence of crimes having been committed, perjury being one of the most serious.

""The police need to apply the law evenly and fairly, without fear or favour. It doesn't matter how much time has passed.""

Following the High Court ruling on Friday, Prince Harry called on the police and prosecuting authorities to ""investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law"".

The Metropolitan Police said it would ""carefully consider the civil judgment"" but added that there was ""no ongoing investigation"".

Coogan told the BBC the second part of the Leveson Inquiry, which was officially abandoned by the Conservative government in 2017, should now take place.

He said he would like to know what Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would do about it if he became prime minister.

""Is he going to fold like a deckchair as previous, mostly Conservative prime ministers, have?"" he asked.

The Leveson Inquiry was established under then-Prime Minister David Cameron following the phone-hacking scandal at News International. The second stage was meant to look into the relationship between journalists and the police.

The inquiry found politicians and the press had been too close, and that a new self-regulated body independent of serving editors, government and business should be established.

It concluded that a legal framework was needed to underpin the body. The industry rejected this, arguing the move would give politicians too much power.

The current regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), was set up in 2014 as successor to the Press Complaints Commission, which was criticised for its lack of action in the phone-hacking scandal.

Coogan told the BBC a new regulatory body was needed, claiming Ipso was ""run by the press, for the press"".

""What we need to see is proper, independent regulation, not run by the press, not run by the government, but independent voices,"" he added.

But Sir Alan Moses, former chair of Ipso, told the Today programme it was ""ridiculous"" to regard the regulator as ""controlled or toothless"".

""It's not run by the press, it's run by independent people with whom I worked,"" he said.

Ipso is paid for by its members through the Regulatory Funding Company, and has come under criticism from the Hacked Off campaign group - which Coogan is affiliated with - as being ""owned and controlled by the very newspapers it is supposed to regulate"".

The judge in the case found that editors and executives at MGN knew of phone hacking, and accepted evidence that that group included former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan.

Mr Morgan has repeatedly denied involvement in phone hacking and delivered a further statement about it outside his home hours after Friday's ruling.

""There is just one article relating to the prince published in The Daily Mirror during my entire nine-year tenure as editor that he [the High Court judge] thinks may have involved some unlawful information gathering,"" he said.

""To be clear, I had then and still have zero knowledge of how that particular story was gathered.""

As well as taking aim at the prince among others, Mr Morgan denied personally hacking a phone or ordering someone to, and said ""nobody has produced any actual evidence to prove that I did"".

But Coogan said that nobody had accused Mr Morgan of this, and that Mr Morgan's statement did not address the judge's comments.

""Piers Morgan could have quite easily received illegally gained information whilst he was editor of the Mirror, used that knowing it was illegally gathered, and still be able to claim that he hadn't instructed anyone to hack anyone's phone or he personally hadn't hacked anyone's phone,"" Coogan told the BBC.","Steve Coogan: Prince Harry's hacking case is 'start of something'By James Gregory BBC NewsBBCSteve Coogan has campaigned for increased press regulationA High Court ruling that Prince Harry's phone had been hacked by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) is the ""start of something"", actor Steve Coogan said.
Coogan was a victim of phone hacking by MGN and settled with the group in 2017.

Former South African president Jacob Zuma says he will not vote for the African National Congress (ANC) and is creating a new political party.

Mr Zuma was the country's president between 2009 and 2018.

He said it ""would be a betrayal"" to campaign for the ANC of current President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Mr Zuma's new party is named uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), meaning spear of the nation, which is the same name as the former armed wing of the ANC.

In an incendiary statement, he said: ""The new people's war starts today. The only crucial difference is instead of the bullet this time we will use the ballot.""

The paramilitary MK, of which Mr Zuma was a member, fought the apartheid-era government of South Africa. It was formally disbanded in 1993 prior to the democratic elections which saw the ANC come to power under Nelson Mandela.

At a news conference in Soweto, Mr Zuma said he was not well enough to speak at length and one of his daughters read a statement on his behalf.

The statement said the ANC was ""one of the great liberations movements of our time"", but that it ""truly saddens me that the ANC of today is not the once great movement that we loved and were prepared to lay down our lives for"".

""I will die a member of the ANC,"" his statement said, but that it had ""changed into an organisation we no longer recognise"".

He said some leaders were behaving in an ""un-ANC manner"" and he intended to ""rescue"" the organisation.

He said the ANC was expected to lose the elections next year and referred to a ""deliberate plot to kill the ANC"". His statement characterised the current government as a failure.

He said President Ramaphosa was a ""proxy of white monopoly capital"" and that the ""ANC of Ramaphosa has declared war against black professionals and intellectuals"".

""I cannot and will not campaign for the ANC of Ramaphosa"".

Doing so would lead to failure and a government by ""sell-outs and apartheid collaborators"", he said.

Instead, he would vote for the newly registered MK party, he said.

""No force can defeat the people's thirst for freedom,"" he said.

Mr Zuma's statement also referred to the ""enemies of our people operating among us"" and said ""there can never be reconciliation without socio-economic justice and equality"".

During the apartheid era, Mr Zuma was an anti-apartheid activist and spent a decade in jail as a political prisoner.

His time as president was controversial and included multiple allegations of corruption. He resigned in 2018 amid significant pressure from within the ANC and was succeeded as president by Mr Ramaphosa.

He was jailed in 2021 for contempt of court after refusing to testify before a panel probing financial sleaze and cronyism under his presidency. His jailing sparked protests and riots that left more than 350 people dead.

He spent two months in prison before being released on medical grounds. That release was later ruled illegal, but he did not return to prison due to overcrowding in the system.","Former South Africa president Jacob Zuma 'won't vote for ANC'By Daniel De Simone BBC News, JohannesburgEPAFormer South African president Jacob Zuma says he will not vote for the African National Congress (ANC) and is creating a new political party.

By Esther Ogola BBC News, Kenya

BBC

A church in Kenya has survived in secret for the last decade. It does not publicise its services in this very religious country because it welcomes gay worshippers.

""The first time I entered the church I cried,"" John, a pastor initially ordained in a mainstream church, told the BBC.

He left his parish because church leaders told him his sexuality was sinful and that he needed to remain celibate.

""I never imagined in my life as a priest, I would be in a space where I would say three words that people think are conflicting. That I am black, I am gay, I am a priest.""

He found out about the underground church, where he now preaches, on social media - though most find their way there via word of mouth. Like all those interviewed at the church, his name has been changed to protect this identity.

Its members are very guarded too about sharing details of their gatherings - those wishing to join are carefully vetted before being invited in, to make sure it is not a trap or someone malicious.

The understanding with all congregants is that security and safety are paramount.

Gay sex is illegal in Kenya, a socially conservative society, though this year the Supreme Court overturned a ban on gay and lesbian organisations being able to register as non-governmental organisations.

Nonetheless this church will not be tempted to register, given the increase in anti-LGBT sentiment - and a recent proposal by one MP to toughen anti-gay legislation.

When I join a service on a warm and breezy Sunday, music drifts from the room of a nondescript building.

People begin trooping in and it fills with 30 or so people.

""We are about to begin. Shall we close our eyes and meditate,"" says Pauline, a minister in a long black robe and crimson red scarf. The whole room hushes.

Pauline is an openly non-binary lesbian, who uses ""they"" and ""them"" as personal pronouns, and is one of the church's founders. Initially it was just a few friends coming together to offer each other support.

""When you are removed from a space [church], there is an urge to know if anyone else has been excommunicated,"" says Pauline, who was not excommunicated but never felt accepted at mainstream churches.

""We wanted to meet other queer Christians who affirm themselves.""

Those attending the church have learnt it is possible to be proud of being African, a Christian and being gay

A feeling of alienation had dominated Pauline's life, especially since their father died of HIV/Aids when they were 12.

""After my dad died, people started treating us differently. They thought we all had HIV. My mum would be served in different cups and plates and we stopped being allowed into some spaces. Church was one of the places we couldn't visit because people believed my mum was 'dirty',"" says Pauline.

Such ostracisation became a pattern, with every church seeming to question some aspect of Pauline's life - whether it be how they dressed or why they chose not to be perceived as being in a conventional relationship.

So Pauline and their friends started meeting on Sundays to watch sermons on YouTube while reaching out to other LGBT Kenyans as well.

It was at the time that anti-gay rhetoric was growing in East Africa. Neighbouring Uganda was beginning to debate introducing a draconian new anti-homosexuality law - that has since been further tightened.

Little did they imagine that, 10 years on, their little gathering would have grown to include more than 200 members.

Most of them have felt obliged to leave their previous places of worship.

For Regina, it followed a dramatic confrontation with a fellow volunteer - part of a team that organised events at her church.

The team gave her an ultimatum when the volunteer found out that she had a girlfriend: her or them.

""It felt like betrayal. I had mentored some of them and now, I couldn't be a part of them any more. Here were people who couldn't extend grace for people to be different,"" she says.

Regina chose her girlfriend. A decade later, yearning to reconnect with her Christian faith and a community, her journey led her to the queer-affirming church.

""There was a time I felt like I had no access to God. All I'd ever heard was that I was a sinner. If prayer is a way of talking to God, how then could I pray? Coming back into a community of faith has allowed me to let go of past hurt,"" she says.

After 10 years the church now has more than 200 members

Yet it is not always easy for the congregation, which has faced numerous attacks - for instance when a landlord or those in the surrounding community are not happy with the fact they accept LGBT worshippers.

They have been locked out of premises despite paying rent, their compound ransacked, members attacked and police have asked for bribes to offer them ""protection"", or threatened to beat and arrest them.

They have changed locations nine times in their 10 years of existence, partly to keep their location a secret.

Arguably, however, one of the hardest hoops to jump through has been helping members reconnect with their faith and a liturgy that they feel has sought to exclude them.

The church, for instance, has its own version of the Apostles' Creed, which is recited by the congregation during a service, usually starting with the words: ""I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth."" It goes on to detail the tenets of their faith.

""We all loved the normal creed, but there were things that were missing,"" says Pauline.

""Women are not recognised and as queer children, we also had to put ourselves in the creed. We see God the father as well as the mother. It affirms everyone.""

The first line of their creed reads: ""We believe in one God, our creator, the source of our being as queer and beloved children.""

The church has amended the Apostles' Creed

The church's schedule is also flexible, as some worshippers are not open about their sexuality to family and friends, so attend mainstream churches before joining its service later.

""When we started out, everybody was insecure and silent about their traumas,"" says Pauline.

This inspired ""Chat and Chew"", a discussion forum that allows worshippers to unburden themselves about navigating life as LGBT Kenyans.

""After the service, many people would seek out the pastors to vent about relationships, rejection by families, homelessness and so many other challenges people face as a result of being queer. So we started 'Chat and Chew' to share, cry, hug, motivate each other and heal.""

But with life in Kenya becoming more openly homophobic, Pauline says some members have considered going back into the closet for their safety - though most want the church to keep going.

""When we started, we didn't think that this space would become so important. But we cannot give up, we have to think of a way forward.

""I want this space to be open to everyone and find a balance where we all respect each other despite our beliefs and traditions.""

All names have been changed to protect identities.

By Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter

Netflix

Gabriel Basso starred in The Night Agent - Netflix's most popular show by number of hours viewed

Netflix released its first comprehensive set viewing figures earlier this week, revealing The Night Agent, Wednesday and Queen Charlotte to be among the streamer's most-watched hits.

It gave the TV industry a glimpse of which shows performed best with subscribers - previously, Netflix had been criticised for being too secretive, often not even telling the people who produced a show how well-watched it was.

""We believe the viewing information in this report... will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them,"" the company said as it released the data on Wednesday.

But the report left a few key unanswered questions.

Netflix ranks its viewing data is by the total number of hours viewed - and FBI thriller The Night Agent came out on top, with 812 million hours viewed.

It's a reasonable metric, but one that favours certain shows, and comes with several caveats.

Where's Stranger Things?

Netflix

Stranger Things didn't release any new episodes in the first half of 2023

The first thing to note about the numbers reported this week is that the figures only cover January to June 2023.

That partly explains why some shows that people most associate with Netflix - such as The Crown and Stranger Things - aren't even in the top 50. Neither released new episodes during that period.

Instead, series that were released within those six months made the top 20, such as You, Ginny & Georgia, Beef and Love Is Blind.

Netflix's top 10: Jan to June 2023

1. The Night Agent season one - 812 million hours viewed

2. Ginny & Georgia season two - 665m

3. The Glory season one - 622m

4. Wednesday season one - 507m

5. Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story - 503m

6. You season four - 440m

7. La Reina del Sur season three - 429m

8. Outer Banks season three - 402m

9. Ginny & Georgia season one - 302m

10. Fubar season one - 266m

However, the other reason why some of the streamer's best-known shows don't rank more highly is that Netflix has divided them up by season.

For example, The Crown's most-viewed series in the first half of this year was season five, which was watched for 76 million hours - making it the 153rd most watched.

But if you add the first four seasons, that figure rises to a total of 214 million hours - which would have given it a considerably higher placing on the list.

Similarly, Stranger Things' cumulative total of 347 million hours would make the show rank more highly as a whole than the 61st placing it got for season four's 133 million hours.

Netflix

Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story was the fifth most watched programme on 503 million hours

Some shows that performed well are lesser known in the UK - Spanish-language La Reina del Sur and South Korea's The Glory will have notched up many of their viewing hours internationally.

A closer look at the TV shows' total hours reveals another issue with the numbers.

Netflix says subscribers spent a whopping 812 million hours watching The Night Agent, which topped the rankings overall.

Divide that by the number of episodes, 10, and you get an average of 81.2 million hours viewed per episode.

However, the average episode length of the Night Agent was 49 minutes, not an hour. So, with a bit of rough maths on our iPhone calculator, that means the average number of households that watched is closer to 99 million.

What about the films?

Netflix

Jennifer Lopez starred in The Mother - Netflix's top-ranking film in the first half of 2023

With all of this talk about TV series, you may have already realised that films are at a considerable disadvantage in the rankings.

A show with numerous episodes has a clear advantage over an individual film.

As a result, the highest-ranking film on the list, The Mother starring Jennifer Lopez, could only reach 14th place with nearly 250 million hours.

That is extremely healthy for a movie - but its two-hour run time naturally cannot compete on the same playing field as The Night Agent, which totalled more than eight hours.

The fact that film and TV durations vary so wildly makes the streamer's decision to list its viewing by hours more complicated - because it doesn't tell us how many people watched a particular show.

For example, the second-highest ranking film in the first half of this year was Luther: The Fallen Sun, starring Idris Elba, which was watched for more than 209 million hours.

Netflix

Idris Elba starred in Luther: The Fallen Sun, which picked up where the TV series left off

As Luther's run time is a little over two hours, you could in theory cut that number in half to get a rough estimate of the number of households that clicked play - about 100 million.

But even that figure comes with its own small print, because this calculation only works if we assume everybody who watched the film got to the end.

While some people will have watched the movie in full, others might have given up after 10 minutes. Equally, at the other end of the scale, people who enjoyed it might have watched it more than once.

Therefore, it's almost impossible to reliably estimate the actual audience in the way we do with terrestrial TV programmes.

These numbers are fascinating and give us a good indication of which TV series and films are engaging audiences the most.","Netflix: What the viewing figures actually tell us about viewing habitsBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporterNetflixGabriel Basso starred in The Night Agent - Netflix's most popular show by number of hours viewedNetflix released its first comprehensive set viewing figures earlier this week, revealing The Night Agent, Wednesday and Queen Charlotte to be among the streamer's most-watched hits.

The kuffiyeh serves as a global symbol of Palestinian solidarity and identity

After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety.

When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter.

His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed.

Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged.

But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter.

""I explained to her that she needs to be very careful,"" he said. ""There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred.""

Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of ""the talk"" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked.

Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.

The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity.

They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity.

Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October.

Samer Elbandak

Samer Elbandak is among the Palestinian parents in the US who are fearful for their children after recent attacks

Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington.

""I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch,"" Ms Bordonaro said. ""I said, those are my kids.""

She then called her two boys and had a ""painful conversation"", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public.

""My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is,"" Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target.

At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume.

Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an ""unprecedented"" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December.

The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a ""terrorist scarf"".

On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York.

In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a ""terrorist"", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying.

Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue.

""There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way,"" Ms Zaki said.

Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi

Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi says that as a Palestinian, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society

Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem.

Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country.

""There is no sense of acceptance,"" Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said.

But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs.

And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children.

""I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again,"" she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed.","When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter.

By Nick Beake BBC Europe Correspondent in southern France

BBC

Nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees, with the River Aude flowing gently through, Quillan could lay claim to one of the most picturesque scenes in all of France.

It was here that British 17-year-old Alex Batty, missing since going on holiday with his mother and grandfather in 2017, reportedly emerged this week from the mountain mist after six years in the wilderness.

By the time he had stumbled upon the narrow streets of Quillan he had been walking for four days, according to French police.

""It was such a sad story, but at least it has a happy outcome,"" says pensioner Martine Vincent, who we meet walking her three-year-old dog called Rambo.

""Although I worry for him psychologically, having spent those years far from home in such a remote place.""

Martine, who moved here from Marseille after retiring, is a link between two parallel universes that co-exist in this vast corridor of southern France.

The first embraces the tiny world of the church, the brasserie and the village square.

The second - all around us, but out of sight - is home to a mixture of international nomads who have opted out of what may be regarded as ""normal life"".

Connecting the realms, Martine sells crepes in the summer to members of the communes, who venture down from their fields and plateaux for this staple of French cuisine.

""A lot of people here think they're wrongdoers, high on drugs, but you find drugs everywhere. They just want an alternative life,"" she says.

The further you travel from Toulouse - the region's largest city - the weaker the phone signal and the less stable the link to the outside world.

For decades, this portal to the Pyrenees has offered a pathway to a different existence - one in which the teenager from north-west England found himself for at least two years.

Some communities in this part of France are rooted in religion, others strive for spiritual enlightenment and then there's the yoga retreats. A hodge-podge of ideals and aspirations. Utopia for some - danger in the eyes of detractors.

Quillan resident Martine Vincent says those living in communes near the town simply want an ""alternative life""

""There are so many different people here,"" Agathe tells us as she sips a lunchtime beer outside the Healthy Life restaurant in the town of Espéraza.

The 26-year-old explains that she was studying for a psychology degree before she realised she wanted to live her subject, not study it in textbooks.

""I live about 20km from here. It's one piece of land, I'm with the forest, with the river. I have fire and eat from my garden,"" she says.

Agathe says Germans, Spanish and Britons come and go and she wasn't surprised that Alex lived around the area with his mother and grandfather.

""Here the nature is wild. People share everything. Everyone has a free mind. It's a choice to live as simply as possible. You can really live outside of everything,"" she says.

Looking on across the table and nodding slowly is Agathe's friend Julien who, like her, has been leading an itinerant life for the last six years.

He has a pet crow tethered to his large black rucksack.

Soon they will begin the journey back to resume their remote lives, devoid of shops, electricity and all that most people would deem essential.

""This is my vision of happiness but it is not for everyone,"" admits Agathe.

Further along the valley, the temperature is dangling above freezing but we find half a dozen nearly-naked figures huddled in a stream.

""Saint Magdalene used to bathe here,"" a woman tells us, as we explain from a respectful distance the story we are working on.

""Go in the water,"" she tells us, ""and you will find the answer to all of your questions.""

The woman goes by the name ""Plume"" or feather.

She and three others are painting stones before they venture into the natural thermal bath here at Rennes-les-Bains.

""I've travelled, and I'm still travelling,"" says the 32-year-old mother of one.

Julien, a member of one of the communes, seen with his pet crow

I immediately think of Alex's experience from the age of 11 to 17: having never gone to a school in this time, so say the French police.

I ask Plume about her own son.

""My child is nine and I've been home-schooling him for nine years. But this is the first year he's been at a school - because it is an alternative school,"" she says.

She says they follow the curriculum, but there is more.

""They also teach how to live in nature, build huts, do blacksmithing - things that society needs as we get back to basics,"" she says.

Rather than feel estranged from reality, Plume says her way of life is making sense to more and more people.

""I don't think there are two worlds, there's only one, but it's a world that's changing. There are things that we moved away from, but we are now coming back to them.""

Back in Toulouse - France's fourth largest city, and a symbol of the modernity many Pyrenees communities have eschewed - the authorities say that Alex experienced no physical violence during his years in the mountains.

The psychological impact will take longer to assess, but there was no evidence he was living in a cult, declared the public prosecutor.

But plenty of people are concerned that many ending up in the seclusion in the mountains rapidly become brainwashed and divorced from their families - and reality.

""We have identified what we call the triple break: the break with family, social ties and with society,"" says Catherine Katz, who supports families whose loved ones have joined cults.

Her organisation - the National Union of Associations for the Defence of Families and Individuals (UNADFI), which works to identify and help the victims of cults - was set up nearly 50 years ago and is funded by the French state.

She fears that Alex will have already suffered from being prised from the life he knew in Oldham.

""The fact that he was not attending school here is a social break: no contact with children, teachers.""

But it was his separation from his grandmother - his legal guardian - that seems to have been the split he was most keen to reconcile.

After walking away from his itinerant lifestyle of the past six years, his first message to the outside world was to her.

""Hello Grandma, it's me Alex,"" he wrote. ""I'm in France Toulouse. I really hope that you receive this message. I love you. I want to come home.""","It was here that British 17-year-old Alex Batty, missing since going on holiday with his mother and grandfather in 2017, reportedly emerged this week from the mountain mist after six years in the wilderness.

There was speculation over whether another uprising was brewing in the West Bank, even before the Hamas attacks on Israel in October.

Frequent raids by the Israeli army, emboldened by a hard-right Israeli government - following deadly attacks by Palestinians, and violent attacks on Palestinians by settlers - had already increased pressure on Palestinians there.

Since the war in Gaza, those pressures have spiralled: Israeli raids into West Bank towns have become more frequent and more forceful, and many families are suffering economically after Israel withheld tax revenues used to pay public servants in the West Bank, and banned Palestinian workers from entering Israel too.

There is anger at almost 20,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, and support for Hamas is rising.

But despite all this, calls by the armed group for an uprising in the West Bank over the past couple of months have come and gone.

Popular mood

Support for Hamas - and armed resistance more generally - has risen sharply since the war in Gaza began.

An opinion poll by the Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found that support for Hamas in the West Bank had more than tripled. Meanwhile, support for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, had dropped significantly. More than 90% of respondents thought Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should resign.

But it seems that support for armed resistance, and disillusion with politics, is not translating into action on the ground.

Since the war began, weekly demonstrations have been held in West Bank cities. The slogans chanted there are against Israel - but also against the Palestinian Authority. But they're usually held in city centres where there is much less risk of confrontation with Israeli soldiers, rather than at checkpoints - as happened during the last Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.

And the numbers turning out for these weekly demonstrations are smaller than they were during previous moments of tension.

""People hesitate to come when Hamas calls for demonstrations, because there is a clear security price to be paid from the Israeli response,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader in Fatah.

But they also don't come when Fatah calls for them, Debiy says, because ""people have lost hope in political parties"".

Destruction in Jenin after the Israeli army operation

Hamas

As the actions of Israel's army in the West Bank have become harsher, and the Palestinian security services more efficient, many people fear that becoming an active member of a militant group could make them a target for arrest or assassination.

More than 270 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October - including 70 children - according to the UN. That's more than half the total number killed this year.

Four Israelis - including three from the armed forces - have been killed by Palestinians there in the same period.

An operation to arrest Palestinian gunmen in the Jenin refugee camp this week lasted several days, with frequent bursts of heavy gunfire, rocket attacks and air strikes. Hundreds of people were detained, with 60 of them handed over to the security services for further questioning.

The Israeli army has also been trying to destroy infrastructure used by armed groups.

This time, it claimed to have found more than a dozen underground tunnel shafts in the camp, as well as facilities for making explosives and ""observation control rooms"" to monitor Israeli forces.

One young man from the camp, who was among those detained this week and released after questioning, said the reason people ignored calls by Hamas to rise up in solidarity was that the group did not supply the West Bank with enough equipment to fight the Israeli army.

""Hamas in the West Bank has not done a good job of organising itself over the last decade,"" said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah.

""The Israelis have been arresting a lot of their members. Hamas is just incapable right now in the West Bank of mobilising and organising an eruption of violence that would be sustainable.""

But previous uprisings here did not rely on Hamas. The second intifada (uprising), which began in 2000, was led by members of the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah.

The role of Fatah

The current leader of Fatah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is widely seen as trying to avoid an escalation in violence against Israel - a major shift in position from his predecessor, Yasser Arafat.

His security services co-operate with Israel to arrest members of armed groups - something that is widely criticised by Palestinians.

Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, denies that the party's position is at odds with public feeling in the territory, or that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is somehow avoiding a fight.

""To say that Fatah is in control and keeping the calm, [it's] as if you are hinting that there is a forceful implementation of a state of calm,"" he said. ""Nobody is forcing anything on anyone.""

""People in the West Bank know that Netanyahu is throwing down bait, through persistent attacks every night against the people of Palestine regardless of their political affiliation - because he wants to provoke the Palestinians into a confrontational mood that he will use as an excuse to escalate the situation.""

The US is pushing Israel to allow a ""revitalised"" PA to govern Gaza once the war there ends. Israel has so far said it will not consider it.

But the chance to govern a unified Palestinian bloc for the first time since 2006 is another incentive for the Fatah-dominated PA to prove its credentials and stop the situation in the West Bank from spiralling out of control.

""It's very clear that Fatah don't want any intifada,"" explained Raed Debiy, the party youth leader. ""They are still very keen to keep the status quo. But the grassroots of Fatah will not be controlled forever. How can you stay silent under daily assassination, daily invasion, daily violation of settlers - this will definitely lead to explosion.""

Possible sparks

In 2000, the spark for the second intifada was a visit by then-Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon to a contested holy site in Jerusalem, known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa compound and to Jews at the Temple Mount.

Sharon's visit happened amid smouldering Palestinian frustration at the failure of the Oslo peace process - and, Dr Shikaki says, was ""exploited"" by Fatah's young guard to launch the uprising.

A small event like this could still trigger something significant, but the situation has shifted since 2000.

Now, far-right ministers in the Israeli government visit the compound, and make inflammatory claims about Israeli control of the site, without triggering a major response - at least not in the West Bank.

""We told the American administration many times that the pressure would definitely lead to some sort of reaction,"" said the senior Fatah leader, Sabri Saidam. ""But no-one anticipated that the reaction would come from Gaza.""

A map illustration showing the wider region of Israel, the occupied West Bank, Gaza, Tel Aviv and Jordan. Gaza and the occupied West Bank are highlighted in red, and show the locations of Jenin, Jerusalem and Nablus.

Where the West Bank goes from here depends partly on what follows the war in Gaza.

That transition is likely to be a precarious time for the West Bank, with hopes of a unified Palestinian leadership - possibly opening the door to talks on a future Palestinian state - clashing with the opposition of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

And lifting restrictions imposed by Israel after the attacks - separating Palestinian and settler vehicles on some roads, for example - could prompt a spike in friction.

But a sustained uprising, of the kind seen two decades ago, will likely require a change in the policy of the West Bank's main political movement - and possibly even a change in its leader.

""It seems Fatah remains critical for an uprising to happen,"" Dr Shikaki told me. ""And as long as Fatah and the security services are not directly involved in the preparation for such an intifada, it seems highly unlikely we'll see one emerging.

""I don't yet see Fatah or the security services on the verge of a turning point,"" he continued. ""But we're moving in that direction.""

Others point to the dwindling faith in Palestinian politics to provide peace, a state, or just a better life.","Lucy Williamson: Hamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoidedBy Lucy Williamson BBC News, JerusalemBBCThere was speculation over whether another uprising was brewing in the West Bank, even before the Hamas attacks on Israel in October.

Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban accuses Brussels of wielding too much power

The political rollercoaster that unfolded in Brussels this week was astonishing even for the most veteran watchers of European summits.

As EU leaders met for the last time before the Christmas holidays, all eyes were on one man: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

He is perceived as the Kremlin's closest ally in Europe, and is the only EU leader who met face-to-face with Vladimir Putin this year.

As his voice grew louder with threats that he would block two crucial decisions on Ukraine, speculation in Brussels was rife about how the negotiations would go down. Would Mr Orban torpedo the summit?

There were rumours the meeting could go on for days, and well into the weekend.

On his way in, a chipper Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo set the mood: ""Russia's threat is real. I'm ready to negotiate, and I've packed a lot of extra shirts.""

EU leaders tucked into a festive lunch that included Breton medallion, sole with root vegetables and panettone.

Then it was time for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a last-ditch plea via videoconference.

France's Emmanuel Macron voiced irritation with Mr Orban's stance

""Ten years ago in Ukraine, people rose up under the flags of the European Union … I ask you one thing today: do not betray the people and their faith in Europe.""

Hours went by. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz put a pullover over his suit; ""a sign he's in it for the long haul,"" an EU diplomat told me.

Then negotiations about opening membership talks with Ukraine hit a wall. The situation was at an impasse: it was 26 against one.

That's when the German chancellor took Mr Orban to the corner of the room and suggested he should leave and go for a coffee.

""No one could hear what they were talking about,"" an EU source told me. ""But it wasn't like Scholz was giving him an order: Mr Orban left voluntarily. He went into his delegation room, which is on the same floor.""

With Mr Orban quite literally out of the way, the other 26 leaders went ahead and the vote was unopposed. Because such a move requires unanimous support, it would not have been possible with the Hungarian prime minister present.

It later turned out that the coffee break that saved Ukraine's EU accession bid had been planned all along. French President Emmanuel Macron said the idea was a collective effort.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas called this strategic loophole ""interesting for the history book"". She joked that she would describe it in her memoirs some day.

When the news about Ukraine's EU membership process broke, the mood in the press room - where hundreds of international journalists were covering the EU meeting - went from sober to euphoric within seconds.

Charles Michel, the man who chaired the meeting, came out to speak to journalists - mostly to congratulate himself on a ""historic moment that shows the strength of the European Union"".

Shortly afterwards, Mr Orban posted a video to social media, describing the decision as ""completely senseless, irrational and wrong"".

So why did he allow it to go ahead?

He justified his decision to walk out of the vote by saying he had ""spent eight hours persuading them not to do this"". He said other EU leaders wanted that decision ""frantically"", so he agreed with them that he would leave the danger and leave them to it.

In reality, EU membership talks are a slalom of caveats and technicalities. It will take years before Ukraine is ready to join the bloc. And Mr Orban knows he still has plenty of opportunities to block the process down the line.

But if EU leaders thought the Hungarian PM had suddenly fallen into line, they were in for a disappointment.

Talks broke down at about 02:30 in the morning, after Mr Orban had used his veto powers to block the more concrete, and much more pressing, decision to send a €50bn ($55bn; £43bn) aid package to Kyiv.

It's not the first time he has used a veto to win concessions for Budapest - such as exemptions for Russian oil imports. But he had never prevented an EU agreement.

His grandstanding did not go down well with President Macron.

""Hungary was respected during this European Council meeting. [Orban] was listened to. This respect implies responsibilities and so I expect from Viktor Orban in the coming months that… he will behave like a European and not take our political progress hostage,"" Mr Macron said.

But Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban's political director (the two are not related), said Hungary was not blackmailing the EU, and in fact it was the other way around.

He implied that the prime minister would start playing ball only if the EU were to unblock €20bn of funds for Hungary, frozen because of concerns about human rights and corruption in the country.

""We don't understand why we don't have access to 100% of financial funds,"" he added.

Hungary wants that money before it agrees to any more for Ukraine.

Despite the diplomatic drama behind the scenes, leaders insisted that a solution on cash for Ukraine could be found early next year, either by bringing Mr Orban on board or forcing the aid package for Kyiv through without his backing.

The EU is already preparing to work around a Hungarian veto if necessary, for example by letting all EU countries except Hungary provide bilateral funding to Ukraine in 2024 outside the EU budget.

It is not unprecedented for one European country to delay a decision on EU money: Brussels diplomats are used to backroom deals and compromise. And when it comes to Ukraine - a country embroiled in a war on the EU's doorstep - the bloc is keen to show that it will stand with Kyiv, for as long as it takes.","Hungary's Viktor Orban: Is one man blackmailing the EU?

By Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis BBC News Science

Tony Jolliffe/ BBC

Volunteers are breathing in four different kinds of air pollution

In a lab in Manchester, volunteers are donning masks to breathe in lungfuls of polluted air.

They're being exposed to different kinds of fumes, from diesel to cleaning products, in a bid to understand how pollution impacts the brain.

Scientists are analysing blood samples and the results of cognitive tests taken before and after exposure.

While it's well known that air quality affects the lungs and cardiovascular system, the brain is less studied.

Dr Ian Mudway, an environmental toxicologist from Imperial College London, is one of the scientists leading the study.

""Over the last 10 years, we have begun to see statistical associations between air pollution and a whole range of brain-related issues - all the way from how children learn, the way in which their cognition changes, to mental health and increased risks of dementia.

""What we're trying to do in this study is to actually do experiments to understand why there's an association, to find out what the underlying biological mechanisms are that link air pollution to adverse effects on the human brain.""

Tony Jolliffe/BBC

The team is creating different kinds of pollution in their lab - including diesel fumes from an engine

The experiments are being carried out at the University of Manchester where researchers are creating four different types of pollution: diesel exhaust, wood smoke, cleaning products and cooking fumes (created by frying a pork chop in a fume cupboard).

The pollutant levels are carefully measured and controlled, then fed into an air chamber - essentially a room-sized plastic sac - and piped out to the volunteers to breathe in.

The participants come to the lab multiple times over several months, and for each visit they are exposed to a different pollutant or clean air for an hour. They never know what they're breathing in while the experiments take place.

Tony Jolliffe/BBC

Prof McFiggans says the hope is that the different pollutants can be ranked in terms of risks

Prof Gordon McFiggans, from the University of Manchester's Centre for Atmospheric Science, says a key aim is to rank the risk associated with each pollutant - both indoor and outdoor.

""There's a lot of emerging evidence that indoor air pollution can actually be more harmful than outdoor air pollution,"" he explained.

""And of course, when you open a window or you have mechanical ventilation, you can get outdoor pollutants inside and also indoor pollutants on the outside, so there's this whole wide range of exposures that everybody's receiving.

""And I think what we need to do is have some comprehensive guidance to individuals, so they're aware of the possibilities of different sorts of implications for their health.""

Tony Jolliffe/BBC

Bryony Evens - one of the volunteers - carries out cognitive tests before and after each exposure

The team says the brain tests are a direct way to look at cognitive function, while the biological samples can reveal what's happening to the body.

""What we want to do is understand the pathways by which the pollution actually affects the brain,"" Prof McFiggans says.

He says the team wants to establish if the pollutants are directly reaching the brain or whether it's an indirect effect. One possibility is that the pollutants cause inflammation in other parts of the body, like the lungs, and the chemicals produced by this biological process then make their way to the brain.

""At the moment we just don't know,"" he says.

Tony Jolliffe/BBC

Dr Ian Mudway says more research is needed into pollution and the brain

The World Health Organization says 99% of the global population breathes in air that exceeds the UN's limits for common air pollutants and the combined effects of outside and indoor air pollution contribute to seven million premature deaths every year.

The team says understanding more about how pollution is impacting brain health is vital.

And although at first glance the study seems small - it involves 13 people - it's one of the largest analyses of its kind. This is because each volunteer is separately exposed to four pollutants (and clean air), and these results are compared with each other and then cross-compared with the results of every other participant to produce an analysis that will be statistically significant.

Tony Jolliffe/BBC

Blood and other biological samples are taken during the trials

Bryony Evens is one of those taking part.

She says she's happy to breathe in pollution in the name of science - and passes the hours hooked up to the air chamber by reading a book.

She says: ""If they can get more data on these sorts of things, it feels like it's a really worthwhile use of my time to help with the study like this.

""Anything that can be done to find out things that cause us damage, just in our normal way of life, that can be changed, seems like a really valuable thing to do.""

The results are expected over the coming months.","Volunteers breathe polluted air to test impact on brainBy Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis BBC News ScienceTony Jolliffe/ BBCVolunteers are breathing in four different kinds of air pollutionIn a lab in Manchester, volunteers are donning masks to breathe in lungfuls of polluted air.

The four-month-old was found safe ""by the grace of God"" after a tornado took him from his home

A four-month-old baby has been found alive ""by the grace of God"" his parents said after the child was sucked up into a tornado in Tennessee.

The couple said a deadly tornado on Saturday tore apart their mobile home, picking up a bassinet with the baby still inside of it.

He survived and was discovered in a fallen tree in the pouring rain.

The baby, his one-year-old brother and parents only suffered from minor cuts and bruises.

As the tornado approached, the mother of two, 22-year-old Sydney Moore, said the roof of their mobile home was ripped off.

""The tip of the tornado came down and picked up the bassinet with my baby, Lord, in it,"" Ms Moore told a local news station. ""He was the first thing to go up.""

Her boyfriend - and the boy's father - lunged to protect Lord in the bassinet, but ended up getting picked up by the tornado, too.

""He was just holding on to the bassinet the whole time, and they went into circles, he said, and then they got thrown,"" Ms Moore said.

As that was happening, Ms Moore grabbed her one-year-old son, Princeton.

""Something in me just told me to run and jump on top of my son,"" Ms Moore said. ""Literally the moment I jumped on him, the walls collapsed.""

""I was being really crushed. I couldn't breathe,"" Ms Moore recalled.

After the tornado passed, Ms Moore was able to escape the crush of the rubble with Princeton. She and her boyfriend immediately started searching for Lord.

After looking for their baby in the pouring rain, they found the child - alive - in what Ms Moore says ""looked like a little tree cradle"".

""But he's here, and that's by the grace of God.""

Ms Moore's sister, Caitlyn Moore, has started a GoFundMe to help them after the tornado completely destroyed their car and home.

British teenager Alex Batty, who was found in France after being missing for six years, has returned to the UK, Greater Manchester Police has said.

Alex vanished in 2017 while on holiday in Spain with his mother and grandfather.

His mother does not have parental guardianship of the 17-year-old and her current whereabouts are unknown.

The force said at a press conference it is yet to establish the circumstances about his disappearance.

Police are yet to determine whether there will be a criminal investigation.

Alex was found on Wednesday by a motorist, who spotted him on a road in the foothills of the French Pyrenees, near Toulouse.

Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle said his force are yet to determine whether there will be a criminal investigation

Speaking at a news conference on Saturday night, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle said: ""It gives me great pleasure to say Alex has now made his safe return back to the UK after six years.""

He continued Alex was met at Toulouse airport by a family member and specially-trained officers earlier, before flying back to the UK.

""This moment was undoubtedly huge for him and his loved ones and we're glad that they have been able to see each other again after all this time.""

GMP said as it had not obtained formal statements from Alex, it could not comment on details disclosed by French authorities about what he may have been doing whilst he has been missing.

""Speaking with him at a pace that feels comfortable to him will ultimately determine how this case is progressed and whether a criminal investigation is to ensue,"" ACC Boyle added.

""We are yet to fully establish the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.""

Alex is believed to have been living a nomadic lifestyle in spiritual communities with his mother and grandfather for the past few years.

French officials said he decided to leave when his mother wanted to go to Finland.

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Taiwan

Chips have driven Taiwan's astonishing economic success

When 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world.

He grew up in a fishing village surrounded by sugarcane fields. He had attended university in Taiwan's capital Taipei, then a city of dusty streets and grey apartment buildings where people rarely owned cars.

Now he was off to Princeton University. The US had just a put a man on the Moon and the Boeing 747 in the skies. Its economy was larger than those of the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany and France combined.

""When I landed, I was shocked,"" Dr Shih, now 77, says. ""I thought to myself: Taiwan is so poor, I must do something to try and help make it better off.""

And he did. Dr Shih and a group of young, ambitious engineers transformed an island that exported sugar and t-shirts into an electronics powerhouse.

Today's Taipei is rich and hip. High-speed trains zip passengers along the west coast of the island at 350km/h (218mph). Taipei 101 - briefly the tallest building in the world - towers over the city, an emblem of its prosperity.

Much of that is down to a tiny device no larger than a fingernail. The silicon semiconductor - wafer-thin and best-known now as a chip - sits at the heart of every technology we use, from iPhones to airplanes.

Taiwan now makes more than half the chips that power our lives. Its biggest manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is the ninth-most valuable business in the world.

That makes Taiwan nearly irreplaceable - and vulnerable. China, fearing it could be cut off from the most advanced chips, is spending billions to steal Taiwan's crown. Or it could take the island, as it has repeatedly threatened to do.

But Taiwan's path to chip superstardom will not be easy to replicate - the island has a secret sauce, honed through decades of laborious work by its engineers. Plus, the manufacturing relies on a web of economic ties that the escalating US-China rivalry is now trying to undo.

Sugar to silicon

When Dr Shih arrived at Princeton, ""the US was just beginning the semiconductor revolution"", he says.

It had just been a decade since Robert Noyce made the ""monolithic integrated circuit"", packing electronic components onto a single wafer of silicon - an early version of the microchip which kickstarted the personal computer revolution.

Dr Shih Chin-tay led Taiwan's foray into chip manufacturing in the 1970s

For the two years after Dr Shih graduated, he designed memory chips at Burroughs Corporation, second then to IBM in computer-making.

At the time, Taiwan was hunting for a new national industry following an oil crisis that had pummelled its exports. Silicon seemed like a possibility - and Dr Shih thought he could help: ""I thought it was time to come home.""

In the late 1970s, he joined Taiwan's best and brightest electrical engineers at a new research lab - the staid-sounding Industrial Technology Research Institute would play an outsized role in recasting the island's economy.

Work began in Hsinchu, a small city south of Taipei - today it's a global electronics hub, dominated by TSMC's enormous fabrication plants. These chip factories, each the size of several football fields, are some of the cleanest places on earth. The finer manufacturing details are a well-guarded secret, and no outside cameras are allowed.

The newest factory - the nearly $20bn fab 18 in southern Taiwan - will soon start producing three-nanometre chips destined for next-generation iPhones.

All of this is far beyond what Dr Shih and his colleagues imagined when they opened an experimental factory in the 1970s. They were hopeful because they had technology licensed from a major US electronics maker - but to everyone's surprise, the factory outperformed its parent. It's hard to explain why and, to this day, the precise formula for Taiwan's success remains elusive.

Dr Shih's recollection is more prosaic: ""Output was better than the original RCA plant, with lower costs. So, this gave the government confidence that maybe we really could do something.""

The Taiwanese government put up the initial capital - first for the United Micro-electronics Corporation, and then in 1987 for what would become the world's biggest chip factory - TSMC.

Shih Chin-tay (second from left at the back) along with other engineers in 1977, soon after returning to Taiwan

To run it, they recruited Morris Chang, a Chinese-American engineer and former executive at US electronics giant Texas Instruments. It was a stroke of luck or genius, or both - today the 93-year-old is known as the father of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.

Back then, he quickly realised that taking on US and Japanese giants at their own game was a losing proposition. Instead TSMC would only manufacture chips for others, and not design its own.

This ""foundry model"", which was unheard of in 1987, changed the landscape of the industry and paved the way for Taiwan to become the pack leader.

And the timing couldn't have been better. Silicon Valley's new crop of start-ups - Apple, AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia - did not have the funds to build fab plants of their own. And they would struggle to find manufacturers for the chips that they couldn't function without.

""They would have to go to leading semi-conductor companies and ask if they had any excess production capacity they could use,"" Dr Shih says. ""But then TSMC came along.""

Now California's ""fabless"" companies could partner with Taiwan's chip makers, who had no interest in stealing their designs or competing with them.

""Rule number one at TSMC is don't compete with your customers,"" Dr Shih says.

The secret sauce

The world produces more than a trillion chips a year. A modern car has anywhere between 1,500 to 3,000 chips. The iPhone 12 reportedly had around 1,400 semiconductors. A shortfall in 2022, driven by soaring demand for electronics during the pandemic, hit sales of washing machines and BMWs alike.

Taiwan's extraordinary success - the island ships more than half of those trillion-plus chips, and nearly all of the most advanced ones - has been driven by its mastery of volume. In other words, Taiwanese manufacturing is incredibly efficient.

Making silicon chips is expensive and painstaking. It starts off with a large ingot of ultra-pure silicon grown from a single crystal. Each ingot may take several days to grow and could weigh up to 100kg.

Morris Chang introduced the foundry model, making Taiwan the world's chip factory

After a diamond cutter slices the slab into skinny wafers, a machine uses light to etch tiny circuits onto each wafer. A single wafer may contain hundreds of microprocessors, and billions of circuits.

What matters eventually is the yield - the area of each wafer that is usable as a chip. In the 1970s US companies had yields as low as 10% and, at best, 50%. By the 1980s the Japanese were averaging at 60%. TSMC has reportedly surpassed them all with a yield that hovers around 80%.

Over time Taiwanese manufacturers have managed to cram more and more circuits into mind-bogglingly smaller spaces. Using the latest extreme-ultraviolet light lithography machines, TSMC can etch 100 billion circuits on to a single microprocessor, or over 100 million circuits per square millimetre.

Why are Taiwanese companies so good at this? No-one seems to know exactly why.

Dr Shih thinks it's simple: ""We had brand new facilities, with the most up-to-date equipment. We recruited the best engineers. Even the machine operators were highly skilled. And then we didn't just import technology, we absorbed the lessons from our American teachers and applied continuous improvement.""

A young man who spent several years working at one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies agrees: ""I think Taiwan's companies are bad at making big breakthroughs in technology. But they are very good at taking someone else's idea and making it better. This can be done by trial and error, continuously tweaking small things.""

This is important because in a semiconductor fab the machines need to be constantly calibrated. Making microchips is engineering. But it's also more than that. Some have likened it to cooking - like a gourmet feast. Give two chefs the same recipe and ingredients - the better cook will make the better dish.

In other words, Taiwan has a secret sauce.

Where it all began: TSMC's headquarters in the Hsinchu Science Park

But the young man, who did not want to reveal his name, or that of the company, says Taiwanese companies have another advantage.

""Compared to software engineers in the US, even at the best companies here, engineers are paid quite badly,"" he said. ""But compared to other industries in Taiwan the pay is good. So, if you work for a big electronic company after a few years, you'll be able to get a mortgage, buy a car. You'll be able to get married. So, people suck it up.""

He described a six-day week which began each day with a meeting at 07:30 and would usually last until 19:00. He would also be called in on Sundays or holidays if there was a problem at the plant.

""If people weren't willing to do the job the company would be finished. It's because people are willing to put up with hardship that these companies succeed.""

The silicon shield

In December 2022 TSMC broke ground on a $40bn plant in the US state of Arizona. It was hailed by President Joe Biden as a sign that high-tech manufacturing was returning to American soil.

Since then the headlines have been somewhat less cheery.

They Wouldn't Listen To Us: Inside Arizona's Troubled Chip Plant, read one. Another said, TSMC Struggles To Recruit Workers While Facing Pushback From Unions.

Chip production was supposed to start next year. Now it's been put back to 2025.

Former TSMC chairman Dr Chang was deeply sceptical from the start. Last year he described expanding chip production in the US as an ""expensive, wasteful exercise in futility"" because manufacturing chips in the US would be 50% more expensive than in Taiwan. But Taiwan's chip-making prowess has put it at the centre of the tech war between the US and China.

Washington wants to prevent Taiwan supplying China with the cutting-edge chips it fears Beijing will use to accelerate its weapons programs and advance its artificial intelligence.

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which strangled Europe's gas supply, US politicians are jittery about Taiwan. They fear that the huge concentration of high-end chip production on the island makes the US economy hostage to a Chinese invasion.

But Taiwanese companies see little economic advantage in moving production off the island. They are doing so reluctantly under political pressure.

People in Taiwan resent the idea that they should be blamed for their success - and that Taiwan should voluntarily weaken what many regard as its ""silicon shield"", while the rest of the world vacillates over whether the island and its democratic society is worth protecting from Chinese aggression.

Taipei 101 towers over the island's wealthy capital

Dr Shih says those who are seeking to forcibly restructure global chip production misunderstand its success.

""If you look at the history of semiconductors, no one country dominates this industry,"" he says. ""Taiwan may dominate the manufacturing sector. But there is a very long supply chain and innovation from every part of it contributes to the growth of the industry. ""

Much of the world's raw silicon comes from China, although most of it goes to the solar industry. Germany and Japan lead the charge in chemicals that are necessary to process the wafers.

Carl Zeiss, a German optoelectronics company better known for making eyewear and camera lenses, produces optical devices that go into the lithography machines made by a leading Dutch company, ASML. The laborious manufacturing works to designs that originate in American companies or the UK-based Arm.

Dr Shih is doubtful Beijing can recreate this supply chain - from materials to design to high-end production - inside China.

""If they want to create a different model then I wish them luck,"" he says with a shrug. ""Because if you really want innovation, you need everyone to work together from all around the world. It's not one company or one country.""

He is just as doubtful about cutting China out as the US has been doing.

""I think that's probably a major mistake,"" he says. ""When I look back, I feel lucky to have witnessed the extraordinary growth of Taiwan's economy and this long period of peace. Now I see conflict in other parts of the world, and I worry it may come to Asia.","The secret sauce for Taiwan's chip superstardomBy Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, TaiwanGetty ImagesChips have driven Taiwan's astonishing economic successWhen 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world.

Ministry of Defence

The Destroyer HMS Diamond only recently arrived in the region

A British warship has shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, the defence secretary has said.

HMS Diamond, a Type 45 Destroyer, successfully destroyed the target on Saturday, Grant Shapps said.

The Ministry of Defence said it was the first time in decades the Royal Navy had shot an aerial target in anger.

The MoD did not say who was behind the incident, but Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for recent attacks in the Red Sea.

The Houthis have targeted foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. They have declared support for Hamas and have said they were targeting ships travelling to Israel.

Merchant shipping was believed to be the drone's intended target in Saturday's incident, the defence secretary said.

The Red Sea lies between north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and connects the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal.

HMS Diamond was sent to the region just two weeks ago ""to bolster international efforts to maintain maritime security"", Mr Shapps said in a statement.

The defence secretary said the attacks represented ""a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security"" in the Red Sea.

""The UK remains committed to repelling these attacks to protect the free flow of global trade,"" he added.

Minstry of Defence

One Sea Viper missile fired and successfully destroyed the target, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said

Earlier this month, the US military said the Unity Explorer, sailing under the flag of the Bahamas and owned by a British company, was among three commercial vessels targeted in an attack by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

On Friday, shipping company Maersk told all its vessels planning to pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea to ""pause their journey until further notice"" after a missile attack on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship.

About 50 large merchant ships pass through the strait every day while double that number pass through the Strait of Hormuz.

According to the MoD, the last time the Royal Navy shot down an aerial target in anger was in the First Gulf War in 1991, when Type 42 Destroyer HMS Gloucester destroyed an Iraqi Silkworm missile bound for a US warship.

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key said: ""One sixth of the world's commercial shipping passes through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait and Red Sea.

""HMS Diamond deployed at short notice to the region from Portsmouth just two weeks ago and is already delivering effect together with our American, French and other allies and partners.","HMS Diamond: British warship shoots down suspected attack drone in Red SeaBy Emily Atkinson BBC NewsMinistry of DefenceThe Destroyer HMS Diamond only recently arrived in the regionA British warship has shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, the defence secretary has said.

Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says.

The official said the case was ""against our rules of engagement"" and an investigation was happening at the ""highest level"".

The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in Shejaiya on Friday.

Israeli troops have been facing stiff resistance in the area near Gaza City.

The case has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for the release of the more than 120 captives who remain in Gaza.

The wait of their families has gripped Israel, as the military carries out its offensive against Hamas.

Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no let-up in the Israeli operations.

""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing,"" he said.

Hamas, for its part, said it had told mediators there would be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"".

An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an initial investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) suggested the three hostages emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.

One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.

A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.

The hostages had either been abandoned by their captors or escaped, the official added.

A building with a message SOS was found in the area, and the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to the killed hostages.

Meanwhile Wichian Temthong, a freed Thai hostage who was held with the three men, recalled his time with them, saying that, as they had no common language they used hand signals to communicate and give each other moral support. He was ""very shocked"" and ""saddened"" to learn of the deaths of the men he spent nearly 50 days in captivity with, he said.

Hostages' relatives are keeping up pressure on the Israeli government

Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, the families have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

In Tel Aviv, thousands of people gathered outside the city's Museum of Art, in what is now known as Hostages Square, and called for a truce, chanting ""Bring them home now"".

""It's our biggest fear what happened - hostages who were alive are now dead,"" Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky is a hostage, said at the vigil. ""We don't need bodies, or bags. Make a ceasefire until all hostages are back, alive. Every day that passes by we're just discovering more and more names of hostages that were taken alive and are now coming back dead.""

The war in Gaza, launched in response to the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in Israel, has killed more than 18,000 people, according to the local health authorities, and pushed hundreds of thousands of others from their homes.

Vast areas of the territory have been destroyed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies.

Israeli authorities say the offensive's goal is to destroy Hamas and release the hostages.

Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US, but they have resisted calls for a ceasefire.

Mr Netanyahu deflected the pressure again on Saturday.

""Despite grief, despite international pressure, we continue until the end, nothing will stop us,"" he said.","Israel Gaza: Hostages were carrying white cloth when shot, IDF saysBy Hugo Bachega BBC Middle East Correspondent, Tel AvivHostage and Missing Families ForumLeft to right: Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer TalalkaThree Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says.

By James Gregory BBC News

BBC

Steve Coogan has campaigned for increased press regulation

A High Court ruling that Prince Harry's phone had been hacked by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) is the ""start of something"", actor Steve Coogan said.

Coogan said the ruling exposed ""widespread contempt"" by newspaper editors for the Leveson Inquiry, which looked at the ethics of the press.

He said the press needed to be held accountable with ""proper, independent regulation"".

Coogan was a victim of phone hacking by MGN and settled with the group in 2017.

The actor and comedian has long been an outspoken critic of sections of the tabloid press.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, won in relation to 15 articles published by MGN, with the judge finding evidence of ""widespread and habitual"" use of phone hacking at the group's newspapers.

Coogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What this shows is the contempt that newspaper editors had for a judge-led public inquiry.

""Now we've got prima facia evidence of crimes having been committed, perjury being one of the most serious.

""The police need to apply the law evenly and fairly, without fear or favour. It doesn't matter how much time has passed.""

Following the High Court ruling on Friday, Prince Harry called on the police and prosecuting authorities to ""investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law"".

The Metropolitan Police said it would ""carefully consider the civil judgment"" but added that there was ""no ongoing investigation"".

Coogan told the BBC the second part of the Leveson Inquiry, which was officially abandoned by the Conservative government in 2017, should now take place.

He said he would like to know what Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would do about it if he became prime minister.

""Is he going to fold like a deckchair as previous, mostly Conservative prime ministers, have?"" he asked.

The Leveson Inquiry was established under then-Prime Minister David Cameron following the phone-hacking scandal at News International. The second stage was meant to look into the relationship between journalists and the police.

The inquiry found politicians and the press had been too close, and that a new self-regulated body independent of serving editors, government and business should be established.

It concluded that a legal framework was needed to underpin the body. The industry rejected this, arguing the move would give politicians too much power.

The current regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), was set up in 2014 as successor to the Press Complaints Commission, which was criticised for its lack of action in the phone-hacking scandal.

Coogan told the BBC a new regulatory body was needed, claiming Ipso was ""run by the press, for the press"".

""What we need to see is proper, independent regulation, not run by the press, not run by the government, but independent voices,"" he added.

But Sir Alan Moses, former chair of Ipso, told the Today programme it was ""ridiculous"" to regard the regulator as ""controlled or toothless"".

""It's not run by the press, it's run by independent people with whom I worked,"" he said.

Ipso is paid for by its members through the Regulatory Funding Company, and has come under criticism from the Hacked Off campaign group - which Coogan is affiliated with - as being ""owned and controlled by the very newspapers it is supposed to regulate"".

Reuters

Prince Harry became the first senior member of the Royal Family to testify in court since the late 19th century

The judge in the case found that editors and executives at MGN knew of phone hacking, and accepted evidence that that group included former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan.

Mr Morgan has repeatedly denied involvement in phone hacking and delivered a further statement about it outside his home hours after Friday's ruling.

""There is just one article relating to the prince published in The Daily Mirror during my entire nine-year tenure as editor that he [the High Court judge] thinks may have involved some unlawful information gathering,"" he said.

""To be clear, I had then and still have zero knowledge of how that particular story was gathered.""

As well as taking aim at the prince among others, Mr Morgan denied personally hacking a phone or ordering someone to, and said ""nobody has produced any actual evidence to prove that I did"".

But Coogan said that nobody had accused Mr Morgan of this, and that Mr Morgan's statement did not address the judge's comments.

""Piers Morgan could have quite easily received illegally gained information whilst he was editor of the Mirror, used that knowing it was illegally gathered, and still be able to claim that he hadn't instructed anyone to hack anyone's phone or he personally hadn't hacked anyone's phone,"" Coogan told the BBC.","Steve Coogan: Prince Harry's hacking case is 'start of something'By James Gregory BBC NewsBBCSteve Coogan has campaigned for increased press regulationA High Court ruling that Prince Harry's phone had been hacked by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) is the ""start of something"", actor Steve Coogan said.

It was here that British 17-year-old Alex Batty, missing since going on holiday with his mother and grandfather in 2017, reportedly emerged this week from the mountain mist after six years in the wilderness.

By the time he had stumbled upon the narrow streets of Quillan he had been walking for four days, according to French police.

""It was such a sad story, but at least it has a happy outcome,"" says pensioner Martine Vincent, who we meet walking her three-year-old dog called Rambo.

""Although I worry for him psychologically, having spent those years far from home in such a remote place.""

Martine, who moved here from Marseille after retiring, is a link between two parallel universes that co-exist in this vast corridor of southern France.

The first embraces the tiny world of the church, the brasserie and the village square.

The second - all around us, but out of sight - is home to a mixture of international nomads who have opted out of what may be regarded as ""normal life"".

Connecting the realms, Martine sells crepes in the summer to members of the communes, who venture down from their fields and plateaux for this staple of French cuisine.

""A lot of people here think they're wrongdoers, high on drugs, but you find drugs everywhere. They just want an alternative life,"" she says.

The further you travel from Toulouse - the region's largest city - the weaker the phone signal and the less stable the link to the outside world.

For decades, this portal to the Pyrenees has offered a pathway to a different existence - one in which the teenager from north-west England found himself for at least two years.

Some communities in this part of France are rooted in religion, others strive for spiritual enlightenment and then there's the yoga retreats. A hodge-podge of ideals and aspirations. Utopia for some - danger in the eyes of detractors.

Quillan resident Martine Vincent says those living in communes near the town simply want an ""alternative life""

""There are so many different people here,"" Agathe tells us as she sips a lunchtime beer outside the Healthy Life restaurant in the town of Espéraza.

The 26-year-old explains that she was studying for a psychology degree before she realised she wanted to live her subject, not study it in textbooks.

""I live about 20km from here. It's one piece of land, I'm with the forest, with the river. I have fire and eat from my garden,"" she says.

Agathe says Germans, Spanish and Britons come and go and she wasn't surprised that Alex lived around the area with his mother and grandfather.

""Here the nature is wild. People share everything. Everyone has a free mind. It's a choice to live as simply as possible. You can really live outside of everything,"" she says.

Looking on across the table and nodding slowly is Agathe's friend Julien who, like her, has been leading an itinerant life for the last six years.

He has a pet crow tethered to his large black rucksack.

Soon they will begin the journey back to resume their remote lives, devoid of shops, electricity and all that most people would deem essential.

""This is my vision of happiness but it is not for everyone,"" admits Agathe.

Further along the valley, the temperature is dangling above freezing but we find half a dozen nearly-naked figures huddled in a stream.

""Saint Magdalene used to bathe here,"" a woman tells us, as we explain from a respectful distance the story we are working on.

""Go in the water,"" she tells us, ""and you will find the answer to all of your questions.""

The woman goes by the name ""Plume"" or feather.

She and three others are painting stones before they venture into the natural thermal bath here at Rennes-les-Bains.

""I've travelled, and I'm still travelling,"" says the 32-year-old mother of one.

Julien, a member of one of the communes, seen with his pet crow

I immediately think of Alex's experience from the age of 11 to 17: having never gone to a school in this time, so say the French police.

I ask Plume about her own son.

""My child is nine and I've been home-schooling him for nine years. But this is the first year he's been at a school - because it is an alternative school,"" she says.

She says they follow the curriculum, but there is more.

""They also teach how to live in nature, build huts, do blacksmithing - things that society needs as we get back to basics,"" she says.

Rather than feel estranged from reality, Plume says her way of life is making sense to more and more people.

""I don't think there are two worlds, there's only one, but it's a world that's changing. There are things that we moved away from, but we are now coming back to them.""

Back in Toulouse - France's fourth largest city, and a symbol of the modernity many Pyrenees communities have eschewed - the authorities say that Alex experienced no physical violence during his years in the mountains.

The psychological impact will take longer to assess, but there was no evidence he was living in a cult, declared the public prosecutor.

But plenty of people are concerned that many ending up in the seclusion in the mountains rapidly become brainwashed and divorced from their families - and reality.

""We have identified what we call the triple break: the break with family, social ties and with society,"" says Catherine Katz, who supports families whose loved ones have joined cults.

Her organisation - the National Union of Associations for the Defence of Families and Individuals (UNADFI), which works to identify and help the victims of cults - was set up nearly 50 years ago and is funded by the French state.

She fears that Alex will have already suffered from being prised from the life he knew in Oldham.

""The fact that he was not attending school here is a social break: no contact with children, teachers.""

But it was his separation from his grandmother - his legal guardian - that seems to have been the split he was most keen to reconcile.

After walking away from his itinerant lifestyle of the past six years, his first message to the outside world was to her.

""Hello Grandma, it's me Alex,"" he wrote. ""I'm in France Toulouse. I really hope that you receive this message. I love you. I want to come home.""","It was here that British 17-year-old Alex Batty, missing since going on holiday with his mother and grandfather in 2017, reportedly emerged this week from the mountain mist after six years in the wilderness.

By Alys Davies BBC News

PA Media

UK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby.

The Liberal Democrat says her family are ""days away from dying"" without access to water or food.

Her relatives and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem say a mother and daughter were killed inside the Holy Family Church complex on Saturday by sniper fire.

The BBC has asked the IDF for comment.

The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent.

""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday.

The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents.""

The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said.

Members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - are Christian Palestinians who sought refuge inside the church after their home was bombed in the first week of the war.

They have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in rooms in the Holy Family Church for more than 60 days.

""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" Ms Moran told the BBC.

They have been keeping in touch with Ms Moran and other family members sporadically through WhatsApp messages and calls - though they have no internet and power is intermittent.

A sixth member of the family - a grandfather - died last month after not being able to get to hospital to receive medical treatment, Ms Moran says.

The five remaining members say they now no longer have access to food or water, and the last remaining generator - which was pumping water from wherever they could get it - has stopped working in the church.

They say soldiers entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and took over a room in a building.

Earlier in the week, the family heard shots being fired and saw bullet casings in the church compound. They say two men were killed on Tuesday while they were coming and going from the building - a bin collector and a janitor.

The family have sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying on a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying outside for days. The BBC has not verified the circumstances of what the image shows.

Ms Moran says there has been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers would target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there.

""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" Ms Moran adds.

Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group.

Early on in the war Israel told people in northern Gaza to move to southern Gaza for their safety. It has also paused military activity in some areas for short periods to allow people to leave. There was also a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow a swap of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

However Israel has also bombed southern Gaza, where it told people to go, and a large number of Palestinians have remained in Gaza City and other northern areas.

Ms Moran says she has been in touch with a number of countries about getting her relatives out of Gaza, but the situation is ""incredibly complex"".

She adds that the family have considered trying to travel to Rafah in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt but say it is too dangerous while no ceasefire is in place.

Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during the brief truce.","UK MP Layla Moran's family among hundreds trapped in Gaza churchBy Alys Davies BBC NewsPA MediaUK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby.

Cardinal Becciu intends to appeal against the verdict

A Vatican court has sentenced Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former adviser to Pope Francis, to five-and-a-half years in jail for financial crimes.

Becciu, 75, was the most senior Vatican official ever to face such charges and once seen as a papal contender himself.

The trial centred on a London property deal that ended in huge losses for the Catholic Church.

He strongly denied charges including embezzlement and abuse of office.

Cardinal Becciu's lawyer said his client was innocent and would lodge an appeal.

He was on trial with nine other defendants. All were convicted on some counts and found not guilty on others.

The trial, which exposed infighting and intrigue in the highest Vatican ranks, had been going on for two-and-a-half years.

After three judges spent more than five hours considering the verdict, Court President Giuseppe Pignatone announced that Cardinal Becciu had been convicted of embezzlement.

The others, who included financiers, lawyers and ex-Vatican employees, were accused of various crimes, including fraud, money laundering and abuse of office. They all denied wrongdoing.

""We reaffirm Cardinal Angelo Becciu's innocence and will appeal,"" stated Becciu's lawyer, Fabio Viglione, after the verdict. ""We respect the ruling, but we will definitely appeal.""

The case - the first of a Cardinal standing trial in a Vatican court - was the stuff of intrigue and skulduggery. It involved allegations of financial impropriety at the top of the Vatican, cloak-and-dagger activity of the kind that has often characterised the secretive world of the Holy See.

It centred around a building not in the Vatican, or even in Rome, but a thousand kilometres away in London - 60 Sloane Avenue in affluent Chelsea, a former warehouse belonging to the department store Harrod's.

Cardinal Becciu (L) had been a close adviser to Pope Francis

In 2014, the Vatican spent more than €200m ($220m; £170m) acquiring a 45% stake in the building, which was planned to be converted into luxury apartments. By 2018, the Vatican's Secretariat of State had decided to buy the property outright, sinking a further €150m euros into the purchase. Allegedly signing off on the whole deal was Cardinal Becciu, who was at the time the Vatican's Substitute for General Affairs - in effect chief of staff to the Pope.

The money, part of which was intended to be used for charitable works, had been paid into a trust run by a London-based Italian financier Raffaele Mincione, who orchestrated the purchase. When the Secretariat later sought financial help from the Vatican's own bank, it sparked concern - and a raid by Vatican police that led to the charges against Becciu, Mincione, and eight others.

But the investigation into Becciu's affairs wasn't limited to the London property deal.

The cardinal was also accused of funnelling vast sums of money to his home diocese of Sardinia, some of which reportedly benefited his family. And it was alleged he paid almost €600,000 to another of the accused, Cecilia Marogna, to help free a nun kidnapped in Mali. Prosecutors said she instead spent much of the money on luxury goods and holidays. Marogna, who had offered her services to the Vatican as an intelligence expert, visited Becciu's residence on several occasions. Both denied claims of a sexual relationship.

The charges against Becciu made him the first cardinal ever tried for financial crimes. It also prompted Pope Francis to strip him of rights including that of voting in a future conclave to select Francis's successor.

After he was removed from office by the Pope in 2020, he gave a news conference to plead his innocence.

""Until 6:02 p.m. on Thursday I felt like a friend of the Pope, a faithful executor of his will,"" Cardinal Becciu said. ""Then the Pope says he no longer has faith in me.""

The whole affair became a test case for Pope Francis's aim of clearing up the Vatican's finances, which were long plagued by scandal, bedevilling the papacy of Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI.","Cardinal Becciu: Vatican court convicts former Pope adviser of financial crimesBy Davide Ghiglione in Rome & Mark Lowen, Rome correspondent BBC NewsGetty ImagesCardinal Becciu intends to appeal against the verdictA Vatican court has sentenced Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former adviser to Pope Francis, to five-and-a-half years in jail for financial crimes.

The game was suspended in the 65th minute with the score at 1-1

Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer is ""stable"" after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch during the abandoned Premier League match at Bournemouth, his club confirmed.

Both sets of players were taken off midway through the second half as Lockyer received medical treatment.

The 29-year-old was responsive as he was carried off on a stretcher to applause and taken to hospital.

Luton said Lockyer was ""stable and currently undergoing further tests"".

""Our medical staff have confirmed that the Hatters captain [Tom Lockyer] suffered cardiac arrest on the pitch, but was responsive by the time he was taken off on the stretcher,"" Luton said.

""He received further treatment inside the stadium, for which we once again thank the medical teams from both sides.

""Tom was transferred to hospital, where we can reassure supporters that he is stable and currently undergoing further tests with his family at his bedside.""

Following confirmation the game was abandoned, both the Luton and Bournemouth players came back out on to the pitch to applaud the supporters, with Hatters manager Rob Edwards visibly emotional.

Lockyer collapsed during the play-off final win against Coventry in May before being taken to hospital.

He subsequently had heart surgery and was given the all-clear to return to playing in June.

The Premier League said in a statement: ""The match between AFC Bournemouth and Luton Town FC has been abandoned due to a player medical incident.

""Our thoughts are with Tom Lockyer and all players involved in today's match.""

Luton called for players, staff and supporters ""to come together"" in support of Lockyer and his family.

""We are sorry to all supporters present that players from both sides were in no state of mind to continue with the game after seeing their much-loved team-mate and friend taken off like that and staff could not carry on with managing the game in such circumstances,"" Luton said.

""We thank everyone for the wonderful applause and singing of Locks' [Lockyer's] name inside the stadium at such a difficult time.""

Bournemouth responded to Luton's update on Lockyer's condition, saying: ""We're relieved to hear Tom is responsive.""

Watch: Baby owl found living in family Christmas tree

A family in Kentucky had a surprise when a baby owl was discovered nestled in their Christmas tree - the bird had gone unnoticed for several days.

A carpet cleaner was working in the home when he says he saw something rustling in the tree and went to investigate.

The family was ""shocked"" by the discovery of the owl and at first thought it was a prank.

The bird has since been released back into the wild.

Homeowner Michele White said she had spent hours decorating the tree - which the family picks out together every year - and had no a clue that the baby owl was there.

If carpet cleaner Bobby Hayes had not noticed the little bird, it might still be in the family's living room, blending in with the branches.

Mr Hayes was plugging in a piece of equipment when he saw something stirring in the tree.

""The owl was literally sitting on a lower limb here,"" Mr Hayes said.

It then crawled deeper into the tree and it took several minutes of searching before he found it again.

He pulled the owl out and sent Ms White a photo.

""I was shocked. I was so stunned,"" she told a local news station.

""I thought he'd put a stuffed animal or an ornament in it, so I called him immediately, like, 'you're kidding me, right?'""

""I have three dogs,"" Ms White said. ""We use this room non-stop: watch TV - the kitchen's right here. No indication.""

Mr Hayes released the owl into the family's wooded backyard.

Ms White's daughter, Madeline, shared a video on social media site TikTok about their discovery.

By Veronique Greenwood Features correspondent

Tea quickly became one of the British Empire's most prized resources in the 18th Century. But it may have also had an unintended effect on the British population – reducing mortality rates.

Tea has been many things in its time – a global commodity, a comforting beverage, and even, in the eyes of some Bostonians 250 years ago this week, a symbol of oppressive politics. But one role you might not have attributed to tea is that of a life-saving health intervention.

In a recent paper in the Review of Statistics and Economics, economist Francisca Antman of the University of Colorado, Boulder, makes a convincing case that the explosion of tea as an everyman's drink in late 1700s England saved many lives. This would not have been because of any antioxidants or other substances inherent to the lauded leaf.

Instead, the simple practice of boiling water for tea, in an era before people understood that illness could be caused by water-borne pathogens, may have been enough to keep many from an early grave.

English demographics from this era have long contained a puzzle for historians. Between 1761 and 1834, the annual death rate declined substantially, from 28 to 25 per 1,000 people. But at the same time, wages do not seem to have risen much and standards of living arguably did not increase. In fact, with the rise of the industrial revolution, more and more people were crowding into towns whose sanitation left much to be desired. ""I would say it's not a settled debate,"" says Antman.

The idea that tea might be the missing link here, thanks to the need to boil water for a proper brew, had been floated by historians in the past. Boiling water kills bacteria that cause diarrheal diseases like dysentery, which was often called ""flux"" or ""bloody flux"" in death records.

""With people coming into cities to work, you would expect, given the level of sanitation they have, that the big killer is water,"" says Antman. But it remained a somewhat fuzzy idea, interesting in theory but difficult to prove.

Antman developed a way to test it, using detailed geographical information about more than 400 parishes across England. There is a simple assumption at the heart of her study: more water sources in an area likely means cleaner water. If one source was contaminated, the inhabitants of a parish could go to another. What's more, if people were closer to the sources of rivers – something Antman infers from parishes' elevation – that water was likely safer than in parishes further downstream.

There were many things already to recommend tea as a drink of the masses

By assigning parishes an inferred level of water quality, Antman could see whether areas with worse water quality saw a bigger decline in mortality than those with good water.

In terms of testing this hypothesis, the key date is 1785, the moment when tea suddenly became affordable for the vast majority of Britons. There were many things already to recommend tea as a drink of the masses: you could make a satisfying brew with just a small amount of leaves, the leaves could be reused for multiple pots, and tea was potentially cheaper than beer, which was rendered expensive both by the complex process required to make it and by a tax on malt.

But when 1784's Tea and Windows Act went into effect, the tax on tea went from 119% to just 12.5% and tea consumption exploded. By the end of the 18th Century, even very poor peasants were having tea twice a day, tea historian Alan Macfarlane writes.

To see if this change correlated with decreased mortality, Antman compared death rates before and after this watershed moment. For this she drew on the remarkable work of demographers E A Wrigley and R S Schofield, who in the mid-20th Century collected parish records from all over England spanning 1541 to 1871, including deaths.

As expected, Antman found that death rates declined in both parishes with good water and those with bad – but there was a significant difference in the size of the decline. Parishes with bad water saw death rates drop 18% more than those with good water.

What's more, she looked to see whether deaths in London from waterborne diseases like ""bloody flux"", and deaths from airborne pathogens like tuberculosis, or ""consumption"", were linked to levels of tea imports. Indeed, flux deaths declined when tea imports went up, while TB deaths remained about the time.

Sometimes people's existing behaviours can make more of a difference to their health than an explicit intervention might

She also checked to see whether deaths in children – not known, in this age or any other, for being major consumers of tea – changed in London with tea imports, and found that there did not seem to be a decline in deaths of those ages two to five.

You might also like:

Interestingly, there was a slight decline in infant deaths, perhaps reflecting the fact that if tea-drinking parents had less diarrheal disease, their very young children might have been protected a bit as well – though Antman points out there is no way to know for sure.

For Antman, who primarily works on issues related to developing nations, this natural experiment in England all those years ago reflects a fundamental truth: sometimes people's existing behaviours can make more of a difference to their health than an explicit intervention might.

Building more privies, developing better plumbing and sewage systems, and teaching people to keep drinking water and wastewater scrupulously separate all might have extended people's lives, had such interventions been widely understood and available.

But with relatively little change to their habits, merely an increase in a behavior they already enjoyed, people seem to have protected themselves. All part of the pleasure of a simple cup of tea.

It's been more than a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and gamers are waiting with bated breath for the next instalment (Credit: Getty Images)

Rockstar Games's wildly successful Grand Theft Auto franchise is set to make its return with GTA VI in 2025. It may not only succeed – but blow its predecessor's revenue out of the water.

It's been condemned by Britain, Germany and France. It's been outright banned in Brazil. Its violence and vehicular mayhem has drawn the ire of organisations including the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the UK's Freedom from Torture organisation. It's also spawned memes and a singular cult fandom.

This subject of both controversy and culture – Grand Theft Auto – is expected to make its return in 2025 with Grand Theft Auto VI, widely known as GTA 6. It's the first release of the game since 2013 – and to call it ""wildly anticipated"" in its community is a great understatement.

Regardless of whether you feel the game represents the worst of digital humanity, or herald its bold creativity and innovation, GTA is a pop-culture force nearly impossible to ignore.

When the long-anticipated first GTA 6 trailer leaked online in early December, the surge of excitement forced developer Rockstar Games to release the official version of the trailer earlier than planned (with the game seemingly headed for a 2025 release, the prevailing notion was that fans wouldn't get that sneak peek until sometime in 2024 at the earliest).

The teaser got huge views, dominated conversation and signalled what could be a massive pay-out for Rockstar Games as well as the companies the enable game-play, such as hardware developers and retailers.

GTA is already a wildly financially successful franchise. This year, Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games, revealed that Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 190 million copies as of September 2023, bringing the whole franchise up to 410 million units sold and a net revenue of $781m (£623m). These figures include sales of the game across multiple platforms and consoles, remastered re-releases and in-game purchases. All told, the franchise has earned more than $8bn (£6.4bn) since 2008.

Expectations are high for GTA 6, not only for its graphics and playability, but also for its business potential. Grand Theft Auto V holds claim to the best opening week sales in video-game history, earning $1.15bn (£1.2bn) in just five days.

Yet despite this extremely high bar, Dmitri Williams, a gaming business expert and professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communications, in California, expects the new release to perform even better.

'A bigger pie'

The value of the video game industry is staggering. By the end of 2023, experts project revenues to reach $250bn (£199bn).

The popularity of esports and free-to-play games that generate massive revenue through in-game purchases and licensing partnerships plays a big role in the astounding financial footprint; as has the introduction of other blockbuster titles, which have also broadened the market.

This overall global industry growth stands to boost GTA 6's revenue potential once it hits the market, says Williams.

""The brand is as strong or stronger than it was before, but additionally the game industry is larger. If it maintains the same slice of the pie, it's going to be big, because it will come from a bigger pie,"" he says. ""The games industry is simply massive globally, and is no single genre or platform. It's so large and so varied that even fractions of it are larger than whole parallel industries like movies.""

Big spending for a big pay-out

Experts identify the release of 2001's Grand Theft Auto III as a turning point for the game's massive popularity. Video-game development grew by leaps and bounds from the late 90s through the early 2000s. Those improvements were on display with GTA 3's innovative and ground-breaking game-play, which propelled it from a novelty to an absolute must play.

Rather than following a linear storyline or trajectory, players could spend hours simply wandering around and exploring the world within the game. Now, this is more the norm, with nearly all major games built within a free-form, open world – but at the time, GTA's approach was a huge innovation.

Creating this ground-breaking type of game has been expensive for Rockstar Games. At the time of its development, GTA 5 was one of the most expensive games ever made, with a budget of $265m (£212m). Of course, the price tag went on to be plenty worth it, accounting for that $8bn it's made since.

For as expensive as Grand Theft Auto V was to create, game-industry analysts are betting that Rockstar Games is going in even bigger this time around. Some speculate the total cost of development and marketing for GTA 6 could be in the $2bn (£1.6bn) range. If that pans out, it'd be it the most expensive video game of all time. But yet again, the eye-watering development cost could also be a savvy investment – industry pundits expect GTA 6 to clear $1bn in its first 24 hours.

The fact that fans have been waiting more than a decade for a new version may be a key driver to help Rockstar Games achieve these sales. But experts say the game's repellent-to-some content may also be a key revenue driver for Grand Theft Auto.

In the past, outrage around the franchise has been good PR and marketing that's converted curiosity into fandom – and fandom into sales. If the company pushes the shock-factor envelope with GTA 6 – effectively dousing past versions with gasoline and lighting them on fire – sales could spike.

Williams says although the Grand Theft Auto franchise is no longer unique in its style of game play, ""the buzz and shock value will continue to be a key part of its appeal"".

Good signs

There are a few pieces of the puzzle, however, that may limit GTA 6's big pay-day potential.

First, Williams believes the gaming industry at large is no longer as reliant on singular blockbuster titles than in the past. ""We tend to focus on splashy games like GTA, but the industry is much larger and more varied now, with vastly more players on their phones than on a traditional console,"" he says. So, although industry analysts expect a big splash upon release, their predictions may be calibrated to a market that's since evolved.

Additionally, it remains to be seen how many players will own or adopt the hardware the game requires. In 2013, Grand Theft Auto V was able to straddle console generations, releasing versions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One (and later, remastered versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S), which helped it reach a substantial audience. Grand Theft Auto VI will only be available for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S.

Adoption of these next-gen consoles has been slower than in the past. For one, Sony experienced massive stock shortages and shipping delays exacerbated by the pandemic. Plus, both consoles weren't the kinds of massive leaps forward that might drive people to upgrade their hardware; the improvements were largely received as more incremental than mind-blowing.

Yet despite these factors, signs appear to be in Rockstar Games's favour.

Sony, for one, has seen a huge uptick in sales for the PS5 lately. Not only has it resolved the logistical problems, but the recent success of Spider-Man 2 has also driven consumers to upgrade (Spider-Man 2 was also a PS5 exclusive). This could be a signal that Grand Theft Auto VI will drive those who have been hesitant or unable to adopt next-gen consoles to finally take the leap.","GTA 6: Grand Theft Auto VI could smash revenue recordsBy Eric Alt Features correspondentGetty ImagesIt's been more than a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and gamers are waiting with bated breath for the next instalment (Credit: Getty Images)Rockstar Games's wildly successful Grand Theft Auto franchise is set to make its return with GTA VI in 2025.

Fruit cakes are a ubiquitous presence in Irish households (Credit: Kate Ryan)

Featured in Bake, a cookbook paying homage to Irish women bakers, Winter Brack is packed full of fruit, warming spices, almonds and orange.

Twelfth Night is the last great frolicking feast of Christmas. It's the day decorations are taken down and stored away – woe betide anyone who takes them down sooner, tempting bad luck for the coming year. Across the British Isles, 6 January is most associated with this hand-me-down piece of folklore, rather than the arrival of the Three Kings to Bethlehem bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh for the baby Jesus.

On the south-western edge of Ireland, in Cork and bordering parts of Kerry, Twelfth Night is still celebrated in style, and exclusively by women. It's a night for soaking up the last vestiges of Christmas spirit in rambunctious merriment rather than a staid religious observance.

Known as Little or Women's Christmas, Twelfth Night is an occasion for women to kick back after the hard work of the festive season, gathering in groups of friends and family to dine, drink, chat, laugh and dance the night away.

Christmas cake is a traditional part of Twelfth Night celebrations; rich with fruit, spices and alcohol, covered with marzipan and royal icing, decorated with festive figurines and foil sashes. Where the annual custom of Christmas cake making, baking and feeding (with copious amounts of brandy or whiskey over many months) persists, the effort and expense is never employed for just one cake.

Three cakes are made to last the 12 days of Christmas in Ireland. The first is cut at midnight on Christmas Eve, marking the end of the Christmas fast and paired with whiskey. The second is cut on New Year's Eve, and the third on Twelfth Night. Charms are baked into the third cake – a bean and a pea – and whoever finds them is named king or queen for a night.

Fruit cakes are a ubiquitous presence in Irish households. There is always one in a tin somewhere, ready to serve with butter and freshly brewed tea. Those enriched with tea-soaked fruits are called tea bracks, a lighter version of Christmas cake and less time consuming to make.

Graham Herterich is a chef, baker and owner of The Bakery by The Cupcake Bloke in Dublin. He recently published his first cookbook, Bake. The book is a homage to the women in his family who taught him to bake and nurtured his love for it, especially his Granny Flynn, who taught him how to make tea brack.

""Food has always been a part of my life. I grew up over the family butcher's shop so, from an early age, I learned the importance of food; that it kept a roof over our heads,"" said Herterich. The men of the family worked in their butchery business, but the women had the biggest influence on him.

""My earliest food memory is my Granny Flynn soaking fruit for a tea brack. I remember sitting at a marbled blue Formica table in her kitchen while she weighed her fruit into a Mason Cash bowl. The tea was always Campbell's loose leaf from its yellow tin and most importantly, Granny Flynn told me that the tea should be almost cold.""

Almost cold because, explained Herterich, if the fruit is put into hot tea they become too plump; too cold and it takes longer to soak. Almost cold and soaked overnight produces the best results.

Granny Flynn was to tea brack what Herterich's Aunty Mary was to Christmas cake.

""Aunty Mary was an unbelievable baker; she did all the Christmas baking and a big part was the gifting of cakes. I remember Aunty Mary coming up to the house specifically to gift these cakes to my mum,"" said Herterich. It speaks to a time when candied and dried fruits, spices and spirits were expensive luxuries for ordinary people and handmade cakes packed full of such dainties were considered generous gifts.

""Aunty Mary's cakes were always packed with fruit, especially lovely dark, rich cherries. She used whiskey and brandy to soak the fruit and feed the cake, made her own marzipan and used a lot of flaked almonds for a really nutty taste.""

Herterich has never lost his love for tea brack, dedicating a whole chapter in his book to the simple pleasure of brack and butter. In honour of his Granny Flynn's tea brack and Aunty Mary's Christmas Cake, Herterich created a Winter Brack that marries his two favourite food memories.

""Winter brack is packed full of fruit, warming spices, almonds and orange. Serve it sliced with lots of proper butter and a cuppa. As a simple alternative to Christmas cake, top with a thick layer of marzipan and Royal Icing,"" he said.

Winter Brack recipe By Graham Herterich

Makes one loaf

This version of the classic Irish fruit cake is packed full of fruit, warming spices, almonds and orange. It can be eaten simply with lots of butter and a cup of tea, or dressed up with marzipan and royal icing for a special occasion.

Ingredients 250g sultanas or golden raisins 50g mixed peel (or mixed candied lemon and orange peel) 25g dried figs, cut into small pieces 25g dried cranberries 25g glacé or candied cherries, cut in half 300g almost cold tea (brew from black loose leaf tea) 125g caster sugar 25g flaked (or sliced) almonds, plus extra to sprinkle on top 1 large egg, beaten zest of 1 orange 2 tsp mixed spice (see Note) 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 225g self-rising flour

Method

Step 1 Place the sultanas, mixed peel, figs, cranberries, cherries and tea in a large bowl and leave to soak overnight at room temperature.

Step 2 When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F fan. Line a 900g (2lb) loaf tin with non-stick baking paper.

Step 3 Add the sugar, almonds, egg, orange zest, mixed spice, cinnamon and vanilla to the fruit and tea and mix well. Gently mix in the flour, being careful not to crush the fruit. Transfer to the lined loaf tin.

Step 4 Bake in the oven for 60–65 minutes. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the centre of the loaf comes out clean. Allow to cool fully in the tin. Turn out of the tin, sprinkle on more almonds and cut into slices to serve.

Note Mixed spice is a particular blend of spice used in baking. It's sometimes called ""sweet spice"" and is a mix of allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, cloves, coriander, fennel, caraway and cardamon, all ground into a powder. If it's unavailable, pumpkin spice can be used, but it will change the flavour of the brack significantly.

By Nicholas Barber Features correspondent

Netflix

While it's heartwarming that an idea Zack Snyder conceived when he was young has reached the silver screen, his new space opera Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is 'derivative'.

There's a scene early on in Zack Snyder's new space opera, Rebel Moon (or, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, to use its full title), in which an innocent farmer goes to a seedy cantina with a mysterious warrior in a hooded cloak. One of the ugly, pig-faced aliens there hassles the farmer, so the warrior uses some nifty fighting skills to defend him, and then they meet a roguish mercenary who agrees to take them off-planet aboard his spaceship. The mercenary is named Kai, rather than Han Solo, but it's fair to say that Rebel Moon is set in a galaxy that isn't far, far away from the one in Star Wars.

In fact, Snyder has said that he started dreaming up the film when he was an 11-year-old boy who had just seen Star Wars at the cinema. But it's clear that he hasn't developed it much since then, because, in the intervening 46 years, all he's come up with is a single question: ""What if Star Wars was crossed with Kurosawa's Seven Samurai?"" There is nothing to Rebel Moon beyond that. Ten years ago, Snyder pitched the concept to Lucasfilm as an official Star Wars project, and when the company turned him down, he rejigged it so that it would have its own separate mythology. But, well, it's not all that separate. Blending futuristic science fiction with medieval fantasy, the film is full of robots, bounty hunters, grimy spaceports and massed ranks of uniformed troops that all look suspiciously familiar.

Not that Snyder hasn't made a few changes. Rebel Moon is recognisably the work of the man who directed 300, Watchmen, Man of Steel and Justice League, and so, compared to the authorised Star Wars films, it has more blood, more swearing, more semi-nudity and more threats of sexual assault. There are more lens flares, more slow-motion action sequences, more shades of brown in the murky colour palette, and a lot more clumsy, expository speeches.

There's also a lot less fun. The idea seems to be that Rebel Moon is more ""adult"" than the Star Wars canon, but what that means is that it's more adolescent. It's certainly not more complex in its world-building or sophisticated in its themes. The goodies are straightforward goodies, and the baddies are straightforward baddies, and you can usually tell which is which by how attractive they are.

The main baddie is the jackbooted Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), and definitely not Darth Vader. He is the right-hand man of the Regent (Fra Fee), and definitely not the Emperor; a mystical tyrant who rules over the Realm, and definitely not the Empire. The heroine is Kora (Sofia Boutella), a soldier who has defected from the Realm, and who now works alongside Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) in a farming village on the moon of Veldt, and definitely not Tatooine. On the hunt for insurgents, Atticus visits Veldt in his massive space cruiser, and demands that the villagers hand over their grain after the next harvest, much like the bandits in Seven Samurai, so Kora and Gunnar decide to assemble a gang of outlaws and fight back.

Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire Director: Zack Snyder Cast: Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae Run time: 2h 14m Release date: 22 December on Netflix

Once they've hooked up with Kai (Charlie Hunnam) in the nearest hive of scum and villainy, they fly with absurd speed and ease to a series of worlds that happen to have Earth-like gravity and atmosphere, and then, with even more absurd speed and ease, they find the very people they are searching for and persuade them to join their crew. Staz Nair is Tarak, a Conan the Barbarian lookalike who refuses to wear a shirt. Doona Bae is Nemesis, an assassin who wields glowing swords that are definitely not lightsabers. Djimon Hounsou is the disgraced General Titus, who reminds us of his role in Gladiator by turning up in a Roman amphitheatre. And Ray Fisher, who played Cyborg in Justice League, is Bloodaxe, a dreadlocked rebel leader.

Despite the grandiosity of the film's bombastic tone, the story turns out to be disappointingly minor

That's about it, as far as the plot is concerned. One of the film's flaws is that once Kora has got her ragtag gang together, they don't do or say anything significant. It's a waste. The costumes are cool, Boutella has a potent combination of toughness and sexiness, Skrein is enjoyably slimy, and all of the actors do what they can with what they're given to work with. But nobody has the chance to demonstrate their abilities or personality.

Nothing exciting happens. There are no challenges to meet, no obstacles to overcome, no Death Stars to destroy. Despite the grandiosity of the film's bombastic tone, the story turns out to be disappointingly minor, presumably because Snyder's main aim was to introduce the cast and to set the scene for Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, which is due next year. Part One itself ends up feeling a bit pointless.

Still, there is something strangely endearing about Rebel Moon. It is honest-to-goodness, unashamedly stupid and derivative pulp tosh, and it is so blatantly a work of gushing fan fiction that it makes you want to go back in time to 1977 and shake the young Zack Snyder by the hand. He couldn't have imagined that somebody would one day give him hundreds of millions of dollars to transfer the scribbles in his notebook to the silver screen, and yet, that is what eventually happened. It's heartwarming. The film may not be up to much, but the story behind it proves that even the most far-fetched childhood dreams really can come true.

New Zealand is home to 10 million cows and 26 million sheep. To reach its climate goals, the country must curb potent methane emissions from animal farming, using science and policy.

The young bull's head disappears into a plastic green hood. He scoops up a mouthful of dried pellets, chews, flicks his ears, and exhales. The hood is attached to a contraption on wheels that looks a bit like a high-tech mobile pizza oven.

But the only thing cooking up here is a precise measurement of methane, a highly potent gas that has a global warming impact 84 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year period.

The bull's breath, laced with gas from his digestive tract, is hoovered up by a fan at 40 litres (8.8 gallons) per second, and measured in this device known as a GreenFeed system.

Over a few minutes of snacking, the bull's burps and breaths are analysed to build a picture of just how much methane his digestive system is churning out. Lorna McNaughton, senior scientist at agri-tech cooperative Livestock Improvement Corporation (LIC) in New Zealand, scrutinises the data on a computer monitor. Some bulls produce more methane, some less.

The bulls, aged between six and 15 months, are ""like teenagers, getting up to all sorts of mischief"", says McNaughton. They're enticed into the GreenFeed contraption six times a day with a tasty snack of Lucerne hay cubes: ""lollies they get for doing the work,"" she says. Their barn stay lasts around 40 days, so researchers can closely monitor food intake and weight gain alongside burps.

Since 2021, LIC and another cattle breeding cooperative, CRV Ambreed, have joined forces to measure the methane of 800 young bulls and counting. It's the first step in breeding dairy cows that naturally produce less methane – one way New Zealand is hoping to curtail emissions of this potent, short-lived greenhouse gas.

New Zealand has an unusual emissions profile, thanks in part to its resident 10 million cattle and 26 million sheep. Almost half of the country's emissions come from agriculture. Methane alone makes up 43% of total emissions, with most methane (more than 85%) coming from livestock.

New Zealand is one of more than 100 countries signed up to the Global Methane Pledge. But while other nations focus on plugging leaks from oil fields and natural gas pipelines, New Zealand's focus is on the methane brewed by microbes in the digestive tracts of farm animals and belched into the atmosphere. The country has long seen this as a niche where it can punch above its weight – and it will need to do so, if it hopes to reach its climate targets.

Its two-step target, established in 2019 legislation, seeks to reduce biogenic methane (from both animals and waste) by 10% on 2017 levels by 2030, and 24–47% by 2050. In turn, this goal is meant to be consistent with global efforts to keep heating below 1.5C, via the country's international commitment under the Paris Agreement.

In 2022, New Zealand unveiled its strategy to curb greenhouse gases and transition to a low-emissions future in an emissions reduction plan. In the agriculture sector – considered an important player due to its substantial chunk of the total emissions pie – plans for a world-first emissions pricing scheme featured alongside boosting mitigation tech development.

But a change in government following October's election has seen the demise of the pricing scheme and a shift in policy to focus on as-yet-unavailable gene editing technology. What will it take to curtail methane from livestock in a country with agriculture at its heart?

""People are attracted to this idea of a silver bullet. But it's a variety of practices and technologies that are going to be needed,"" says Sinead Leahy, principal science advisor at the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre (NZAGRC).

The NZAGRC has sought to cultivate this variety of solutions since 2009. It doesn't employ research teams directly, but strategically funds external teams investigating new technologies like vaccines and methane inhibitors.

Since its inception, around NZ$90m (£44m/US$56m) has been invested in research, infrastructure and capability through the NZAGRC. A 2018 review acknowledged the research is ""scientifically challenging"", and found a ""shortfall in feasible and practical mitigation options"". Currently available approaches – mostly changing how operations are managed on-farm, like frequency of milking – would only result in a 10% emissions reduction at best, according to the review.

Five years on, that's still largely true. New Zealand's 2030 target, to reduce emissions by 10% on 2017 levels, is looking ""challenging"", says Leahy. ""There may be a limited set of technologies that will be available in time for the 2030 target,"" she estimates. Leahy is more optimistic about the potential of emerging tech in the longer term. ""We're really looking more in that 2030 to 2040 bracket for when investment into science will hopefully start to pay dividends,"" she says. In the meantime, she adds, most reductions are likely to come from farmers becoming more efficient, alongside land-use changes and reductions in the waste sector.

Methane makes up 43% of New Zealand's total emissions

Methane inhibitors may be one of the technologies to make the grade in time. One is already on the market internationally: a Dutch-developed feed additive called Bovaer. The compound reduces dairy cow methane emissions by 30% – but only in feedlot animals where it can be added to every mouthful. This makes it tricky to implement in New Zealand's pastoral grazing system where cattle are outdoors munching grass. ""We need to figure out an effective way to make it work, and be economically viable, in our system,"" Leahy says.

Another attractive tech solution, a methane-blocking vaccine, is much less likely to be ready by 2030. Considered a holy grail due to its potential to be long-lasting and applicable in pasture-based farming, a vaccine remains elusive despite more than a decade of research effort. ""We don't have any proof of concept,"" says Leahy. ""But no experiments to date have shown that it won't work either, which is encouraging,"" she adds. Scientists at AgResearch, a research institute in New Zealand, have achieved promising test tube results, but vaccination trials in sheep haven't been successful yet.

One idea is likely to be in farmers' climate toolbox sooner than either inhibitors or vaccines. Selective breeding with low-emitting bulls could reduce the methane outputs of the country's dairy herd, which currently accounts for almost one-fifth of all of New Zealand’s emissions.

""We're seeing 15 to 20% differences between low emitters and the average,"" says McNaughton. ""So I'm feeling quietly optimistic.""

Leahy agrees that the results appear promising, but notes there's a lot more research and time needed to gather data. ""There's still a good bit of work to be done to verify the trait and make sure there are no adverse effects for breeding a low-emitting cow, for example on fertility,"" she says.

Evidence from a US dairy cow herd suggests that low-methane cows might be smaller in stature with different gut bugs, but that their milk production and composition won't be affected. Similarly, Irish cows that emit 15% less methane produce just as much milk for the same amount of feed, according to a study published this week.

At LIC, a similar investigation is underway with a new generation of daughters sired by the low-emitting bulls identified so far. The cows will be closely monitored for any adverse effects, such as reduced milk production.

By 2026, if no curveballs emerge, McNaughton expects that LIC and its competitor CRV will have a methane index for the bulls that sire 90% of New Zealand's dairy herd through artificial insemination. This will mean that farmers can select bulls with lower methane profiles, among other desirable traits.

Selective breeding of low-methane dairy cattle rests on a foundation of sheep. While sheep emit, on average, 13kg of methane every year, compared to 98kg for a dairy cow, starting with sheep was a logistical choice. ""Sheep are much easier to handle,"" says Suzanne Rowe, senior scientist at AgResearch, ""and their gestation period is much shorter."" Fourteen years ago, Rowe and a team of AgResearch scientists wondered whether a sheep's methane emission levels could be passed from one generation to the next. They gathered 1,000 sheep from across New Zealand and began to measure their gas outputs over 48 hours using a respiration chamber.

""It took years to get through the 1,000 animals,"" says Rowe, explaining the painstaking process to refine measurement down to just one hour instead of 48. The ""huge challenge"" yielded three incredibly useful things: a flock of low-emitting sheep, a flock of high-emitting sheep, and a portable unit for fast methane measurement.

The two flocks were relocated to the same farm in the South Island. High emitters bred with other high emitters, and lows with lows. Every year, Rowe and her team measured the methane outputs of the new lambs. And every year, the low emitters got lower by about 1%. Today the difference between the high and low flocks is, on average, 18%. Plus, the reduction doesn't appear to come at the cost of other desirable traits – in fact, changes that have emerged so far are positive. ""[Low-emitter] sheep had more wool,"" says Rowe. ""We also found that they have a slightly different fatty acid profile in their milk and meat, and were leaner.""

Meanwhile, the portable methane chamber has enabled farmers across New Zealand to identify the low emitters in their own flocks as part of a 'Cool Sheep' programme. ""We've been driving up and down the countryside, measuring sheep from different farms,"" says Rowe, estimating that they have now measured 30,000 individuals. ""The plan is to enable farmers to choose the low emitters within their own flocks,"" Rowe explains. ""That's really important because it means that the animals they choose are already adjusted to that environment.""

What impact will selective breeding have on New Zealand's methane emissions? For sheep, Rowe estimates a decrease in methane emissions of around 0.5 to 1% per year. ""Over time, that quickly becomes substantial,"" she says. ""The other benefit is that, other than the actual measurement of the animal, it's low cost. And it's permanent."" But the impact of selective breeding is also slow to emerge, as genes filter through a population over time rather than acting instantaneously.

In Canada, low-methane bull semen became commercially available earlier this year. Semex, the company behind the genetics, says adoption of the low-methane trait could reduce Canada's dairy herd emissions 20–30% by 2050.

New Zealand's numbers are more conservative. In 2021, modelling by the country's Climate Change Commission suggested that low-methane breeding for sheep and beef cows would produce 4.5–7.5% reductions by 2050. For the dairy cattle herd, breeding is predicted to come online from 2030 and yield a 7.5–13.5% methane reduction by 2050.

Behind the incremental march of scientific efforts, the spectre of a price on agricultural emissions looms large. New Zealand's first attempt at introducing an agricultural emissions levy dates back to 2003, when a 'fart tax' furore erupted. 'Fart tax' is a misnomer, says Leahy, as most gases are expelled out the front end: ""about 75:25 nostrils to mouth"".

The proposed levy would have raised NZ$8.4m (£3.1m or US$4.9m) per year for research. Vehement opposition to the idea saw one MP drive a tractor up the steps of parliament, and another lead two cows around parliament grounds, with one depositing a steaming cowpat in front of the parliament.

Since then, the agriculture sector has lobbied hard to avoid being roped into New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, making it an outlier industry that doesn't pay a price for its climate pollution.

In 2017, Jacinda Ardern, who had campaigned on a promise to bring farming into the ETS, unexpectedly became prime minister. The farming sector secured a deal with the government to co-design a separate pricing scheme in a partnership called 'He waka eke noa' (named after a Māori proverb, meaning ""we're all in this together""). In advice delivered during the design process, New Zealand's Climate Change Commission said that ""a farm-level pricing system, supported by well-designed, well-thought-through policy"" is an important tool for achieving the country's climate targets.

In the final plan, announced in December 2022, the government would set different five-year prices for methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, with input from farming representatives and the Climate Change Commission. The scheme was meant to come into effect in 2025, but by mid-2023 the plan had fallen over. A new centre-right coalition is likely to see any potential pricing of cow burps pushed back to 2030.

Suzi Kerr, a New Zealand economist with expertise in emissions pricing policy, says the delay is ""going to be really damaging when they have to hurry to catch up later.

""Hurrying to catch up is costly, it's difficult,"" she says.

According to Kerr, an agricultural pricing scheme wouldn't just benefit the climate, it would also help New Zealand farmers by providing consistent market signals and a mechanism to reward them for their climate action.

""Farmers are in this invidious position of knowing what they should be doing from a global point of view, but facing really strong economic signals that are saying 'produce more' and don't focus on mitigation. Pricing levels that playing field,"" says Kerr.

We're seeing 15 to 20% differences between low emitters and the average – Lorna McNaughton

Without a pricing scheme, will New Zealand be able to reach its methane reduction targets? ""New Zealand's history would suggest no,"" says Kerr.

In 2021, emissions from the agriculture sector dipped by 1.5%, in part due to fewer sheep and cattle. But it’s a tiny blip after almost a decade of a stubborn plateau, and not necessarily enough to indicate a new trend, says Kerr. ""Improvements in lowering emissions have been offset by increased levels of production,"" she says. ""Even if they're beginning to fall in some places, they're not falling nearly fast enough.""

Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2e. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2e per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.

In advice released this week, the Climate Change Commission warned that New Zealand is not on track to meet its overall emissions reduction targets. For methane, the commission writes: ""Existing policies alone… would not result in adequate biogenic methane reductions to meet the 2030 target.""

In order to achieve a 10% methane reduction by 2030 and reach the longer-term 2050 target, the commission emphasised that agricultural emissions pricing from 2025 will be ""key"" and a ""necessary tool"". New tech, diversifying land use, and increasing on-farm efficiency will also play a role in the 2030 target, according to the commission.

Breeding low-methane animals, along with the development of methane inhibitors and vaccines, will help New Zealand meet its long-term climate goals, the commission notes.

The analysis was conducted in October 2023, before the election resulted in a change of government and new policy direction. While the new climate change minister welcomed the advice and has affirmed the government is ""steadfast"" in its commitment to the Paris Agreement, several keystone climate policies are set to be discarded or delayed – like the agricultural pricing scheme. The shift has attracted criticism from environmentalists for relying on technological works-in-progress, rather than proven interventions to reduce agricultural emissions. It will be up to the new government whether they heed the commission's advice.

If the country fails to meet its agreed emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, it may need to spend billions of dollars on overseas carbon credits to offset its climate pollution, including the methane-laced breath of farm animals.

Leahy says reducing methane in line with the official targets will be ""challenging"". But she remains optimistic. She used to give presentations and tell the audience that she wasn't even sure it would be possible to reduce the methane brewed in an animal's gut. ""Fast forward to today, and yes, there is sheep breeding, yes, there are inhibitors, yes, there are some feeds. These are all coming. And hopefully more,"" she says.

By Alexis Benveniste Features correspondent

The holiday season brings cheer for some, but layoffs for others. What's with the practice – and why does it feel so acute right now?

On 13 December, US marketplace-platform Etsy announced it would be laying off 11% of its staff, cutting more than 200 jobs.

Two days earlier, US financial firm State Street announced they'd lay off 1,500 workers; the same day, toy-maker Hasbro reported cuts of more than 1,000 jobs. This news came just days after Swedish streaming service Spotify laid off 1,500 employees, and global publisher Condé Nast cut 5% of its workforce. In the UK, pharmaceutical companies, banks, automakers and consulting firms also announced sweeping layoffs, shuffling off workers in the last few months of the year.

With the holidays in full swing, the months of November and December feel like a particularly cruel time to let people go. Why does it happen?

This year, at least, rocky economic headwinds may play a role, says Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. He believes most companies that conducted these end-of-year mass layoffs did so under the assumption that an economic downturn is imminent. He calls this response a ""vibecession"", where perceptions drive action – even if the data doesn't tell a story to back up the widespread scepticism.

And indeed, the numbers largely don't. Although consumer confidence is down, and many people perceive a weak economy amid inflation and a tightening jobs market, indicators show the economy is mostly strong. This misalignment, says Bloom, feeds into companies scrambling to boost end-of-year-profits in anticipation of a sharp economic downturn, despite the data to the contrary. Hence, layoffs based on ""vibes"".

""Companies try hard to avoid layoffs over the holiday season, so those making cuts now must be under some pressure,"" says Bloom. ""This is in response to something they did not see two months ago, but is now so pressing it can't wait another two months.""

Shirley Lin, a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York, is more sceptical that these cuts are unique to current economic conditions. While layoffs may particularly be high in sectors including tech and media right now, she says end-of-year job cuts are a common business practice across industries.

""Companies typically track their financials to the calendar year when reporting quarterly results,"" she says. ""A company's annual reports to shareholders, which are also important to attract new investors, include last-quarter financial results."" Holiday-season layoffs then are often the result of last-minute cost cutting intended to boost a company's balance sheet for the benefit of shareholders.

In addition to saving on paying employee wages, says Lin, cuts also enable employers to avoid paying out bonuses, many of which land at the end of the year.

Yet while the timing of these layoffs is not a new business practice, Lin believes the current, highly active state of labour has raised the profile of these holiday-season job cuts.

""We're seeing a historic surge of public support for workers' rights,"" she says. ""In recent years, there's been growing interest in companies and shareholders taking workers' wellbeing and contributions to the company's success back into account, along with the equitable workplace policies.""

So, although cutting workers in Q4 is a straightforward way to shore up a company's end-of-year financials, Lin says the approach is ultimately harmful to a company's stakeholders, employees and business partners.

""Layoffs just before the holidays can damage company morale and its public image,"" she says. ""The timing of these layoffs can seem particularly cruel, since worker productivity in the US has soared, but historically without similar levels of wage growth.""","The 'vibecession' driving holiday mass layoffsBy Alexis Benveniste Features correspondentAlamySpotify is among the companies that have made holiday-season layoffs this year (Credit: Alamy)The holiday season brings cheer for some, but layoffs for others.

By Robin Catalano Features correspondent

She is believed to be the first enslaved person and first African American to publish a book of poetry. She also forced the US to reckon with slavery's hypocrisy.

When the Dartmouth sliced through the frigid waters of Boston Harbor on 28 November 1773, the Quaker-owned whaler carried a cargo that included 114 chests of British East India Company tea. Eighteen days later, the tea, along with 228 additional trunks from the soon-to-arrive Beaverand Eleanor, would play a starring role in the US Colonies' most iconic act of resistance, which ultimately led to the Revolutionary War.

In the Dartmouth's hold was another precious cargo: freshly printed copies of Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, a collection by Phillis Wheatley, the first enslaved person, first African American woman and third female in the US colonies to publish a book of poetry. Her life and work would become emblematic of the US struggle for freedom, a tale whose most visible representation – the Boston Tea Party, when American colonists protested Britain's ""taxation without representation"" by dumping tea into the harbour – celebrates its 250th anniversary on 16 December this year.

Evan O'Brien, creative manager of the Boston Tea Party & Ships Museum, said, ""Our mission, especially this year, is to talk not just about the individuals who were onboard the vessels, destroying the tea, but everyone who lived in Boston in 1773, including Phillis Wheatley.""

Actor Cathryn Philippe, who interprets Wheatley at the museum, connected with the poet's remarkable accomplishments. ""You often hear about the tragedy of enslavement, which is a part of history that needs to be understood. But we don't hear much about the joy or successes of enslaved or formerly enslaved Africans.""

Wheatley was born in what is now Senegal or Gambia and was abducted in 1761 when she was just seven or eight years old. Forced, along with 94 other Africans, aboard the slave-trading brigantine Phillis, she survived the treacherous Middle Passage, which claimed the lives of nearly two million enslaved people – including a quarter of the Phillis' ""cargo"" – over a 360-year period, and arrived on Boston's shores that summer.

We shouldn't hesitate to call her a genius

Frail after eight weeks at sea, the girl caught the attention of wealthy merchant and tailor John Wheatley. He purchased the child as a gift for his wife, Susanna, and renamed her after the vessel that had spirited her away from her home.

Phillis showed a natural aptitude for language. David Waldstreicher, professor of history at the City University of New York and author of the forthcoming biography The Odyssey of Phillis Wheatley, said, ""She became fluent and culturally literate and able to write poems in English so quickly that we shouldn't hesitate to call her a genius.""

Robin Catalano

Despite Wheatley's connection to the Boston Tea Party, her legacy remains largely unknown (Credit: Robin Catalano)

Although the Wheatleys were not abolitionists (they enslaved several people, and segregated Phillis from them) they recognised Phillis' talents and encouraged her to study Latin, Greek, history, theology and poetry. Inspired by the likes of Alexander Pope and Isaac Watts, she stayed up at night, writing heroic couplets and elegies to notable figures by candlelight. She published her first verse, in the Newport Mercury, at age 13.

While many New Englanders took note of the poet's gifts, no American printer would publish a book by a Black writer. Poems on Various Subjects was eventually financed by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and published in London. As a 19-year-old in 1773, Phillis travelled to the city, escorted by the Wheatleys' son. She was an instant sensation. Her celebrity, along with England's criticism of a new nation that simultaneously subjugated her while comparing its own relationship to the Crown as slavery, led the Wheatleys to manumit her in 1774.

A keen observer, Phillis frequently wrote about significant moments in America's fight for independence, carefully walking a fine line between being overtly political or critical of the colonial government as a Black woman. As a 14-year-old in 1768, she praised King George III in the poem To the King's Most Excellent Majesty for repealing the Stamp Act. Two years later, in On the Death of Mr. Snider Murder'd by Richardson, she memorialised the killing of 12-year-old Christopher Snider by a Massachusetts-born Loyalist during a protest over imported British goods.

Soon after, in 1770, a skirmish between Colonists and British soldiers erupted in front of the Old State House, not far from where Phillis lived on King Street, culminating in the Boston Massacre. Today, a circle of granite pavers, its bronze letters dulled by age and thousands of footsteps, marks the spot where blood was spilled. Following the incident, Phillis was inspired to write the poem On the Affray in King Street, on the Evening of the 5th of March, 1770.

Scholars estimate that Phillis produced upwards of 100 poems. Because her work makes few references to her own condition and is often couched in Christian concepts and the extolling of popular figures of the day, she has sometimes been dismissed as a white apologist.

Ade Solanke, a writer and Fulbright Scholar whose play Phillis in London will be performed in Boston later this year, said, ""I think the biggest misconception about her is that she wasn't an abolitionist. You think of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, people who were explicitly condemning slavery and going to war against it. But the act of writing poetry as a Black woman in this time period was pretty radical.""

Wendy Roberts, a University at Albany professor who recently discovered a lost Wheatley poem in a Quaker commonplace book in Philadelphia, agrees. ""I don't think any deep reader of Wheatley comes away thinking she's an apologist. She was asserting herself, her agency, her wish for freedom, her presence as a person.""

Most buildings in Boston with a direct connection to Phillis' life no longer stand. Some were razed by a pair of fires in the 18th and 19th Centuries, and others have been replaced by urban renewal in the mid-1900s. The Old South Meeting House, a stately Georgian red-brick church built in 1729 and tucked between glass-and-concrete skyscrapers on Washington Street, is an exception. Besides being Phillis's place of worship, it was a cradle of philosophical debate, and served as planning headquarters for the Boston Tea Party. It now operates as a museum, with a statue of the poet flanked by exhibits on other ground-breaking figures from the pre- and post-Revolutionary eras.

The writer almost certainly strolled through 50-acre Boston Common, the country's oldest public park (and site of the newly unveiled, and controversial, statue honouring Civil Rights icons Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King). Phillis may have conducted the Wheatley family's shopping at Faneuil Hall, once the city's main marketplace for household goods – and located next to where enslaved people were once sold. It's now a retail centre, where visitors can pick up souvenirs, sample a variety of foods, or take a tour with a guide outfitted in 18th-Century breeches, waistcoat and tricorne hat.

Some experts speculate that Phillis participated in funeral processions for Snider and the five victims of the Boston Massacre, in which their coffins were paraded from Faneuil Hall to the Granary Burying Ground – also the final resting place of Revolutionaries like Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Paul Revere. Sombre and quiet, the cemetery bears more than 2,000 slate, greenstone and marble gravestones, many carved with traditional Puritan motifs like blank-eyed death's heads and frowning angels.

Phillis, who died in poverty after developing pneumonia at age 31, is thought to be buried in an unmarked grave, with her deceased newborn child, at Copp's Hill, in Boston's North End neighbourhood. An elegant statue of her, alongside renderings of women's rights advocate Abigail Adams and abolitionist Lucy Stone, holds court over the Commonwealth Avenue Mall. There are also plans for a replica of the Dartmouth to sail into the Boston Tea Party & Ships Museum on Griffin's Wharf, and when it does, it will host a permanent exhibit on the poet.

Phillis's legacy is perhaps best experienced in the work of contemporary artists. As part of the 250th anniversary celebrations, Revolution 250, a consortium of 70 organisations dedicated to exploring Revolutionary history, will host a variety of performances and exhibits, including a full-scale re-enactment of the Tea Party on 16 December. Several events will honour the poet, among them a photography exhibit by Valerie Anselme, who will recreate Phillis' frontispiece that adorned the original publication of Poems on Various Subjects.

Artist Amanda Shea, who frequently hosts spoken word events and poetry readings around the city, explained that, in many ways, she is carrying on a legacy pioneered so long ago. ""I feel like I'm part of the continuum of Phillis Wheatley. It's really important to be able to write and tell our stories. It's our duty as artists to reflect the times in which we live.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/67740028,West Indies v England: Phil Salt hits stunning century as tourists win third T20,['Author not found'],"Phil Salt finished unbeaten on 109 off 56 balls

Third T20, Grenada West Indies 222-6 (20 overs): Pooran 82 (45), Powell 39 (21); Rashid 2-32 England 226-3 (19.5 overs): Salt 109* (56), Buttler 51 (34), Brook 31* (7) England won by seven wickets Scorecard

Phil Salt's stunning century helped England pull off their third-highest T20 international chase as they beat West Indies by seven wickets in the third T20 in Grenada.

Salt brought up his first T20 international hundred off 51 balls and finished unbeaten on 109, with Harry Brook smashing the 21 runs needed off the final over to ensure England chased 223 with a ball to spare in an incredible win.

Nicholas Pooran's 45-ball 82 led West Indies to 222-6 as Adil Rashid finished the pick of the England attack by taking 2-32.

England are 2-1 down in the five-match series with two left to play.

Salt and Jos Buttler both passed fifty as they put on 115 for the first wicket to give England hope, with Salt, who hit nine sixes and four fours, continuing the brutal hitting after his captain was out for 51.

England needed 31 to win off the final two overs but Alzarri Joseph held his nerve in the penultimate over as he conceded only 10 to give the hosts the upper hand.

But Brook, who was on seven from two balls heading into the final over, calmly hit a four and two sixes off the experienced Andre Russell's first three balls to put England on the brink of victory.

He and Salt then ran two before Brook flashed at a wide one from Russell and it flew over the boundary at deep third.

The fourth T20 is in Trinidad on Tuesday.

Stunning Salt assault

Phil Salt and Jos Buttler put on 115 - the fifth highest opening stand for England in men's T20 internationals

Being challenged with needing the highest successful T20 international chase at the Grenada National Cricket Stadium - and to keep the series alive - appeared to bring a clarity of thought and approach to England's batters.

Buttler, steely determination in his eyes, signalled his intent with two sixes off the first over. When he reverse swept Akeal Hosein and Gudakesh Motie for fours some of his sparkle started to return.

He fell after a superb relay catch on the boundary, with Hosein having the presence of mind to toss the ball to Joseph knowing he would have crossed the rope.

Salt, whose previous best T20 international score was 88 not out, showed great composure as his shot selection remained largely conventional, with West Indies' bowlers unable to prevent him from accessing his favoured areas down the ground.

The Lancashire batter even had the game awareness to realise perhaps Brook - fresher and a genuine 360 batter - might have been better placed to see England over the line.

Brook, who hit his first ball for six in the 18th over, performed his role perfectly, carting Russell over extra cover and fine leg to swing the tie England's way before finishing it off in style.

Salt is the fifth England men's batter to hit a T20 international century, after Alex Hales, Dawid Malan, Liam Livingstone and Buttler.

If he continues to perform like this, Salt looks nailed on for a place at the top of the order at next year's T20 World Cup in the West Indies and United States, having been unfortunate to miss out when England won the trophy last year.

Tough day for England's attack

For all the excitement of a thrilling chase, this was a chastening day to be an England bowler.

Rashid and Reece Topley managed to keep their economy to 8.00 per over and were tellingly the only ones to bowl their full allocation.

But even they suffered at the hands of a dangerous West Indies line-up - Topley was hit for 18 off the final over of the innings, with Jason Holder providing the late fireworks.

Apart from the first couple of overs when Topley found some swing - dismissing the left-handed Kyle Mayers with a beautiful delivery which that nipped to take the edge - there was precious little encouragement offered by the pitch.

Tymal Mills felt the heat the most as he was brutally dismantled by Pooran, who walloped six sixes and six fours to lead his side's recovery from 8-2.

Mills' two overs cost 36 runs, while Gus Atkinson returned 0-32 from the same number.

The majority of England's seam attack struggled with their lengths on the pitch, while spin bowling all-rounder Livingstone, 0-27 from two overs, lacked the necessary control.

On a day when 34 sixes were struck - the second most in a T20 international - England's bowlers will at least be heartened to be on the winning side.

And in a more positive sense this was also a useful learning curve for the more inexperienced members of the attack on what to expect, and what they must do to adapt, in the Caribbean next year.

West Indies captain Rovman Powell: ""It's obviously disappointing to score 222 and lose, but the guys gave it a fair shot.

Final Score: Are Manchester City mentally fatigued?

Manchester City's stuttering title defence suffered another blow as Michael Olise's 95th-minute penalty rescued a dramatic point for Crystal Palace.

City had led 2-0 through goals by Jack Grealish and Rico Lewis and appeared to be cruising to victory until Jean-Philippe Mateta pulled a goal back with 14 minutes remaining.

There was more drama to come in stoppage time, when Phil Foden caught Mateta as he attempted to clear and referee Paul Tierney pointed to the spot.

Michael Olise stepped up to slot past Ederson and spark wild celebration among the away fans who had seen their team pegged back for much of the match.

The draw, City's third consecutive at home, leaves the defending champions in fourth place, three points behind leaders Liverpool.

Palace have still only won one of their past 10 games but after losing out to a stoppage-time goal by Liverpool last week, this must have felt like a victory for Roy Hodgson's men, and was certainly celebrated like one.

Man City fail to finish off opponents again

Jack Grealish's first goal of the season did not arrive until he found the net against Tottenham on 3 December but he has now scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career

City have now won only one of their past six league games, and face losing more ground next week when they are in Saudi Arabia for the Fifa Club World Cup.

Once again, they paid the price for failing to finish off their opponents, although few saw this latest setback coming when they led 2-0.

Pep Guardiola's side appeared in full control for much of the game, although they had to be patient to find a gap in Palace's packed defence.

The breakthrough came when Foden found space on the edge of the area and slipped Grealish clear to find the net, with the goal eventually given after a lengthy video assistant referee check for offside.

Josko Gvardiol could have added an instant second, but was denied by Dean Henderson after running clear, and there was more frustration for City at the start of the second half when they had a goal disallowed for Rodri's offside after Julian Alvarez's free-kick flew straight in.

Their second goal did arrive shortly afterwards, with Foden and Grealish combining before Lewis slotted home, but even that cushion was not enough to prevent Palace's unlikely comeback.

From agony to elation for Palace

Palace's experience last week means they know only too well the agony of conceding a crucial late goal but this time their emotions were all about elation.

The Eagles were missing most of their regular frontline because of injury, and had offered little other than sporadic breaks forward for much of the match but they did give City a warning of what was to come when Gvardiol's slip allowed Mateta to run clear on the stroke of half-time.

Ederson dashed from his goal to send the French striker tumbling and was fortunate to escape with a booking and to only concede a free-kick, which Olise fired narrowly over.

Palace continued to defend deep and counter-attack in the second half but hardly looked like scoring until Jeffrey Schlupp escaped down the left and found Mateta in the middle to slide in and reduce the deficit.

Suddenly the Eagles were back in the game and, with City appearing to panic, the visitors made the most of their opportunity in stoppage time.

Foden, who had given away the ball in the first place, took a wild swing in the corner of his own penalty area and only succeeded in making contact with Mateta, who was only playing because of Odsonne Edouard's injury.

Olise kept his nerve when he stepped up to take the spot-kick, sending Ederson the wrong way and earning his side a point.

Joao Felix's third goal in his last four games for Barcelona was not enough to secure the win

Barcelona's winless run stretched to three games as they were held to a draw by Valencia in La Liga.

Xavi's side were looking to bounce back after successive defeats - 4-2 to Girona in the league and then 3-2 at Royal Antwerp in the Champions League.

They seemed on course to do so positively when Joao Felix turned in Raphinha's cross from close range.

England were challenged by ""super extreme"" conditions in their Test defeat by India, says captain Heather Knight.

England were bowled out for 136 and 131 in the dramatic 347-run defeat in Mumbai.

Off-spinner Deepti Sharma took nine wickets in the match with her off-spin, while seamer Pooja Vastrakar took 3-23 in an impressive spell on day three.

""There are plenty of learnings we can take from this,"" said Knight.

""In the main formats we play, which are in white-ball cricket, you're not often exposed to conditions like this.

""It was super extreme and I'll be surprised if we play in something like this again unless we play a Test match here in the near future.""

In total, 23 out of 36 wickets fell to spin throughout the Test; Charlie Dean led the way for England with five in the match while seamer Lauren Bell also impressed with her 3-67 in India's first innings.

India posted 428 after batting first, with four players reaching half-centuries, while Nat Sciver-Brunt was the only player to pass fifty with her 59 in England's first innings.

None of Knight's side have played a Test match in India previously, while only Smriti Mandhana and captain Harmanpreet Kaur from India's side have played a home Test.

Knight admitted to being ""outplayed"" but despite the significant margin of victory, she says they are staying ""philosophical"" about the result.

""If we had another Test match after this, we would have learned a lot,"" said Knight.

""But the pitch deteriorated quicker than we thought it would. It was a lot easier to bat on first, and then India bowled outstandingly well and showed us how to play in these conditions.

""When they batted, they showed us how to get the right balance between attack and defence and put the pressure back on our bowlers. They suited these conditions and executed their plans.""

However, while some batters, including Knight and Sciver-Brunt, were undone by very good bowling in England's second innings, both collapses also included several loose shots and a lack of clarity in the tourists' approach.

In their first innings, batters were going back in their crease uncertainly against the spinners, and in the second innings there were also cross-batted shots against the turning ball and indecisive footwork against the seam.

Women's Tests are not a regular occurrence in the cricket calendar. England and Australia play the most in international cricket, though that is usually only a maximum of two a year.

Their infrequency makes it difficult for players' preparation but Knight added that the shorter format is England's focus, with the T20 World Cup taking place in Bangladesh in 2024 where they will be faced with similar conditions.

""The T20 series win was brilliant for us,"" said Knight. ""Our side in that format is coming together really nicely and we were able to expose some of our young players to these conditions.

""Our main cricket coming up is white-ball cricket - that's what we are prepping for mostly - so that was really pleasing for us.

""Playing a red-ball game in isolation is quite tricky - the girls from the T20 series only had two days to prepare. I think that's why we're quite philosophical about losing the Test match.

""Obviously we were desperate to win it and play well but India massively outplayed us.""","England captain Heather Knight says she is ""philosophical"" about her side's 347-run defeat by IndiaEngland were challenged by ""super extreme"" conditions in their Test defeat by India, says captain Heather Knight.

Arsenal squandered the chance to move top of the Women's Super League with defeat at local rivals Tottenham.

Martha Thomas scored the only goal of the game in the second half to earn Spurs a first-ever WSL win over the Gunners.

It leaves Arsenal in second, behind champions Chelsea on goal difference, having missed the majority of chances at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Spurs remain sixth after their first win in six league games.

Arsenal, knowing a win would take them top for at least 24 hours before Chelsea visit Bristol City on Sunday, came closest in the first half when Caitlin Foord struck the post.

They continued to dominate after the break, Alessia Russo sending a header off target from just six yards out while Frida Maanum whistled another effort only just over the bar from wide on the left.

But Spurs held steady and took a shock lead on 58 minutes, a clever passing move from the back culminating in Thomas sliding in from Celin Bizet's low cross.

Arsenal fail to build on Chelsea performance

After dismantling Chelsea 4-1 so impressively at Emirates Stadium last week, Arsenal appeared to have an opportunity to showcase themselves in this game - with a chance to beat their rivals at one of English football's most impressive arenas, and potentially lead the WSL at Christmas.

Things did not work out that way. Arsenal did not have a shot on target until the 42nd minute, Maanum stinging the gloves of Barbora Votikova, in a sluggish first-half display.

They struggled to play with pace and get the ball wide. When they did, they found Foord in space to create their best first-half openings.

The Gunners clearly faced strong words from manager Jonas Eidevall and started the second half at a much higher tempo - but failed to take their chances.

Eidevall had to smash the emergency glass to send on Vivianne Miedema, still returning to full fitness after an anterior cruciate knee ligament injury, midway through the second half. It was her 100th WSL appearance, and the first time she, Russo and Beth Mead have been on the pitch for the Gunners at the same time.

Having such a quality attacking trio gives hope they can keep pace with Chelsea in the new year - but this was far from the perfection Arsenal need for a first WSL title since 2018-19.

Spurs adapt to earn sensational win

Spurs manager Robert Vilahamn took the hint to adjust his side to the test of facing a WSL top-four side, following the chastening experience of conceding 11 goals in their past two matches, against Manchester clubs City and United.

He may also have had in mind a dreadful WSL record against Arsenal - Spurs had not beaten their rivals in seven previous league meetings, losing six, while never keeping a clean sheet.

Spurs' 4-4-2 was much more compact and deeper lying, and it helped them ride out a stormy opening to the second half where Arsenal had eight shots in 13 minutes.

And they took their chance when it came through Thomas - her first goal in six league matches, having scored six in her opening four WSL games.

They should have scored a second in the final seconds as they broke forward following an Arsenal corner, with keeper Manuela Zinsberger stranded after coming up. Only a spectacular last gasp tackle denied Rosella Ayane a tap-in.","Martha Thomas scored the only goal of the game in the second half to earn Spurs a first-ever WSL win over the Gunners.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/sports-personality/67714256,Sports Personality of the Year: Sir Kenny Dalglish wins Lifetime Achievement award,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Sports Personality

BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2023 Venue: MediaCityUK, Salford Date: Tuesday, 19 December at 19:00 GMT Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app

Liverpool and Scotland legend Sir Kenny Dalglish will be honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

The 72-year-old won eight league titles and three European Cups as a player and manager at Anfield after joining the club from Celtic in 1977.

Dalglish, who also led Blackburn to the title, is Scotland's most-capped male player and joint record goalscorer.

""Receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award is truly an honour,"" he said.

""I have always believed in the importance of team success, and I wouldn't be where I am today without all of the players I've played with, the people I've worked for, and the supporters that stood by me, so this is for them.""

Glasgow-born Dalglish began his career at Celtic, where he won four Scottish league titles before Liverpool paid a then British record transfer fee of £440,000 to sign him.

In his first season with the Merseyside club he scored 31 goals, including the only goal in the 1978 European Cup final against Bruges at Wembley.

He would go on to win a further two European Cups and five league titles before becoming player-manager at the age of 35 in May 1985.

""To go from the dressing room to the manager's office, I wasn't always the most comfortable, but I had fantastic support from senior people at Liverpool,"" Dalglish said.

""The most comfortable place for me as a player was in the dressing room. I missed the dressing room, but you've got to move on in your life and that is what destiny was telling me, move on.""

Liverpool won a domestic Double in Dalglish's first season as player-manager at Liverpool

Despite his unease, Dalglish thrived in the role as Liverpool claimed their first domestic league and cup Double in 1986, and two more league titles before he announced his shock resignation in February 1991.

Dalglish was the club's manager at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a result of a crush during an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium.

The Scot ensured the club was represented at the fans' funerals and, along with his wife Marina, helped support bereaved families.

In a biopic about Dalglish's life, Marina and their daughter Kelly spoke about the impact of the Hillsborough disaster on him, and how it eventually led to his resignation.

After leaving Liverpool, where he had ended his playing career with 515 appearances and 172 goals, Dalglish took charge at Blackburn Rovers and guided the club to the Premiership title in 1995.

Short spells at Newcastle United and back at Celtic followed and, after an 11-year break from management, he returned to Liverpool in 2011 to lead them to League Cup success - the club's first trophy in six years. He was sacked three months later after an eighth-place Premier League finish.

Speaking about Liverpool, where he is known as 'King Kenny', Dalglish said: ""The football club means everything to ourselves as a family.

""Glasgow and Liverpool are very similar. Obviously, they have shipyards with two teams in the city. But for me, the people were fantastic as well. They've got a real sense of humour and they take time to talk to you.""

On the international stage, Dalglish played 102 times for Scotland, scoring 30 goals.

Fellow football legends Sir Alex Ferguson, George Best, Sir Bobby Charlton and Pele have previously won the Lifetime Achievement award.

In 2022, the award was won by Jamaica's eight-time Olympic gold medal-winning sprinter Usain Bolt.

Rob Herring celebrates as Nick Timoney crashes over for Ulster's fourth try

Investec Champions Cup: Ulster v Racing 92 Ulster (21) 31 Tries: Timoney 2, McCloskey, Rea; Cons: Cooney 4, Pen: Cooney Racing (5) 15 Tries: Tarrit 2, Le Garrec

Rampant Ulster stormed to an impressive bonus-point win over Racing on a raucous Investec Champions Cup night at Kingspan Stadium.

Ulster saved their best for Europe and ended a three-game losing streak with a four-try, five-star display.

Nick Timoney scored in each half, with Stuart McCloskey and Matty Rea also crossing for the hosts.

Janick Tarrit scored two late tries for Racing after Nolann Le Garrec's first-half try.

A lot was expected from Racing's star-studded team under former Leinster coach Stuart Lancaster.

And while they were dangerous on the break, they gave possession away cheaply and conceded 12 penalties as they slipped to back-to-back defeats in the competition.

In contrast, Ulster came out with real purpose and conviction and shrugged off the disappointment of losing their last three games to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bath to take a positive step towards desired qualification for the last 16.

Despite recent defeats, they felt they were not far away and kept faith in the expansive attacking principles that they have carried into this season.

The quick-tap penalty was a tactic that reaped rewards leading to three of their four tries, while good defence denied Racing a four-try bonus point that could be crucial when Pool 2 is completed in January.

Jacob Stockdale fights for possession

Mistakes flowed from both teams, but it was high tempo, hugely entertaining rugby and with the home crowd getting behind them, Ulster raised their game.

They bossed territory and possession - Racing didn't land a footstep inside the Ulster '22' until 16 minutes had elapsed.

And as a reward for owning the ball for long spells, Ulster were able to force their French visitors into mistakes with James Hume and McCloskey carrying well and finding pockets of space.

Line-out woes aside, the home side profited from good set-piece play and their first two tries came from quick five metre tap penalties from Timoney and McCloskey.

Ulster got the maul rolling early off the first one, and Timoney dotted down for the opening try after four minutes.

There was no stopping McCloskey from a couple of metres out after another quick tap and go leaving Ulster 14-0 up entering the second quarter.

Racing looked dangerous on the counter-attack and scrum-half Nolann Le Garrec thought he had brought his team back into it, only for the try to be ruled out for crossing.

Racing still possessed huge threat when the ball was turned over and a superb cross-field kick out to Juan Imhoff ignited a brilliant break. When the ball was recycled, Le Garrec was there to dot down for a try his personal effort deserved.

Both sides displayed an appetite for running the ball from deep and a missed pass by Michael Lowry to Stockdale, then Timoney to John Cooney, left Ulster inches away. When the ball was recycled, a grateful Matty Rea had the easiest job of the night to fall over the line for a third Ulster try.

Steven Kitsoff has won the World Cup twice with South Africa

World Cup winners on show

Racing fans waited a long time to see South African legend Siya Kolisi make his debut for the club and similarly, Ulster fans were keen to see the two-time World Cup winning captain in Belfast.

Yet he had minimal impact in the first half with Ulster deserving their 21-5 half-time lead.

Kolisi's Springbok team-mate Steven Kitsoff put in a serious shift playing 70 minutes plus, as he savoured his first win for his new team.

Dan McFarland's side had blown half-time leads in recent weeks but this time they were in mood waste the platform they had built for themselves.

Timoney grabbed the fourth try and resulting bonus point five minutes after the restart with a try similar to his first, coming off another tap and go, with Racing having answers to the marauding Ulster forwards.

James Hume tackles Gael Fickou

The visitors were always going to have a spell and pounded away at Ulster.

Finally the pressure told when Tarrit picked up from the base of a ruck and rumbled over.

Gilbert missed the conversion leaving Ulster well placed leading 28-10.

Stockdale had his ears pricked all evening, ever alert and quick to read the pass and he almost produced a spectacular 14-point swing just when the visitors thought they were in again.

He picked off Le Garrec's pass on Ulster's tryline and bolted for home, but was hauled down around the halfway line by Le Garrec.

Tarrit muscled his way over again for Racing's third try but another missed conversion left them with a mountain to climb.

It proved too daunting as Ulster held on for a resounding victory they will hope can propel them through a busy and crucial stage of the season.
