Experts have told the BBC that Donald Trump could land a knock-out blow on the Republican primary race in New Hampshire tonight, less than a week after he steamrolled his opponents in Iowa.

""Let's be clear, his brand is winning,"" said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist in the state.

Recent polling suggests Trump still holds a substantial lead over Nikki Haley, his closest - and now, only - rival in the contest.

The former president's New Hampshire rallies have seen hundreds of voters line up in freezing conditions to hear him speak.

Haley, a former United Nations ambassador, has focused her campaign efforts on New Hampshire.

She has said that New Hampshire will ""correct"" Iowa's vote - a claim her opponents used in attack ads. A former South Carolina governor, she added she hopes her state then ""brings it home"" with its upcoming primary on 24 February.

Time will tell whether that strategy works.

Her third-place finish in Iowa behind Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis may have stalled her momentum, some experts say.

And if Trump performs as well as he did in Iowa, it could mark the end of the road for Haley and a presidential nomination for Trump.","Reuters Copyright: Reuters Supporters of Donald Trump attend a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire Image caption: Supporters of Donald Trump attend a rally in Portsmouth, New HampshireExperts have told the BBC that Donald Trump could land a knock-out blow on the Republican primary race in New Hampshire tonight, less than a week after he steamrolled his opponents in Iowa.

Miranda Blair

Miranda Blair didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016 because he scared her.

This week, she was wearing a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat as she waited in sub-freezing temperatures to hear him speak in Manchester, New Hampshire, as he rallied Republican voters to choose him as their nominee.

A lot happened in between to change Ms Blair's thinking.

""Just a few years ago under Donald Trump, I felt like I could afford groceries and bring my girls skiing, and do all the things we wanted to do,"" she said.

The 40-year-old sales manager voted for Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2008 and found Mr Trump's lack of political experience disqualifying in 2016. Disliking the options, she didn't vote that year.

But during Mr Trump's presidency, she changed her views. And her financial struggles now, under a Joe Biden presidency, have cemented her support for Mr Trump.

""I'm a single mom of two young girls, and so life is really difficult right now, as far as the economy goes,"" she said. Despite earning more money than ever, she feels she will never be able to buy a home and has never paid so much in rent.

Ms Blair's evolution towards Mr Trump, spurred by the soaring cost of living in recent years, US involvement in new foreign conflicts and a belief that the Biden government has abandoned people like her, helps explain why the former president looks near certain to win the Republican presidential nomination.

In New Hampshire, the second state to choose its nominee, Mr Trump has opened a double-digit lead over former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and his other big rival, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, has dropped out.

In interviews across the state before voting began on Tuesday, at campaign headquarters and pubs and diners, Mr Trump's supporters said returning him to the White House was, as Ms Blair put it, ""our last shot at restoring our beautiful country"".

Mr Trump is doing everything he can to nurture that sentiment.

""The Washington swamp has done everything in its power to take away your voice,"" he told supporters in Manchester on Saturday, while Ms Blair listened from the crowd. ""But this Tuesday it is finally going to turn your way, your voice is going to be given back. You had a voice just three years ago.""

The White House has for months made President Biden's economic record a key part of his re-election pitch. They argue his investments in infrastructure and green energy policies have boosted job creation and wages, and helped the economy weather the high inflation that dogged much of his first term.

But even though gas prices and inflation have now come down, voters like Ms Blair look back on the Trump presidency as a rosier time.

Chris Ager, the state committee chair of the New Hampshire Republicans, said Trump supporters were drawing a stark contrast between how they felt during his presidency, and how they feel now. ""He's essentially saying, 'Were you better off now than you were four years ago? Data says most people say no, we're not better.""

Rene Cote, who recently became a US citizen, said Mr Trump was a better choice than Mr Biden because of ""the economy, fuel [prices] - everything you can imagine was better than it is today"".

His son-in-law, John Ratliffe, believed that Mr Trump, who has taken a hardline stance on immigration issues since day one, would do a better job securing the southern border with Mexico. ""People are just sick of what's going on,"" he said. ""Something needs to be done and he's the only one who has the gall to do it.""

Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman, said volunteers were happy to brave frigid temperatures because ""suffering through the cold for a few short days to knock doors is much better than suffering through four more years of Joe Biden's disastrous presidency"".

Mr Trump's policies and persona have not fundamentally changed since his first campaign, to the extent Mr Ager referred to the strategy in New Hampshire as ""2016, 2.0"".

But Mr Trump's political message has changed after four years in the White House, which ended with him falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and a riot by his supporters at the Capitol.

He has drawn his supporters closer in 2024 with allegations of a vast legal and political conspiracy against him.

For many of his supporters in New Hampshire, this worldview has become fact, and their distrust in the US government has grown.

Just over half of the state's Republican voters believe that Mr Biden won the 2020 election ""due to voter fraud"", a Washington Post/Monmouth University poll released on Monday found. About 82% of voters who say they will vote for Mr Trump hold this view.

Ms Blair is one of them. She does not trust the vote-by-mail system and when asked about the false claims around the 2020 election said Mr Biden was not charismatic enough to have won a record-setting 81.2 million votes.

On Sunday, dozens of supporters gathered at Tempesta's, a pub in rural Keene modelled on a grand Dublin bar, to hear Congressman Matt Gaetz, a key Trump ally, make his pitch for the former president.

After his speech, he fielded a question from one man about the January 6 ""hostages"" - how Mr Trump has started referring to the individuals who were jailed, convicted, or pleaded guilty for their participation in the Capitol riot.

More on the US election

Lynne Mason, 60, said she didn't believe that the storming of the US Capitol three years ago was violent.

Her top concern was about illegal immigration but she also worried that high housing costs were putting her children off having families, and she was baffled by her $300 grocery bills.

Over and over, conversations with voters at the events turned back to the economy.

BethAnne Tatro, also at the Keene meet-and-greet, said that the cost of running her Monadnock Country Café had skyrocketed in the past couple of years. Sales were down and costs were up, she said, adding: ""Inflation was terrible.""

""I wanted to move my small business forwards,"" the 53-year-old said. ""In 2023, it went backwards.""

Getty Images

Ms Tatro did not point to a specific policy that Mr Trump should introduce in order to ease inflation or bring prices down. But she believed if he returned to the White House, people would simply feel more confident about their prospects. ""We'll see things adjust themselves.""

A Trump victory is looking very likely here, but not guaranteed. Ms Haley has been blazing through the state trying to court moderate Republicans and independent voters.

The state's large share of unaffiliated voters - those who chose not to register with a political party - are free to vote in the Republican primary and are currently up for grabs.

One activist group, Primary Pivot, is trying to convince unaffiliated voters who lean left to vote in the Republican primary because, as co-founder Robert Schwartz put it, ""Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and to our country… and we're all better off if both major parties have candidates that respect our democracy.""

Ms Haley has gained ground in the polls, and with that the confidence to attack Mr Trump more directly than before. After he appeared to confuse her with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms Haley, 52, questioned whether the 77-year-old was ""mentally fit"" for the pressures of the presidency.

Getty Images

On Sunday, she asked supporters: ""Do we really want to have two presidential candidates in their 80s?""

Elizabeth Smith, a 64-year-old who travelled from Ohio to volunteer for the Haley campaign, said that her candidate was the most qualified, given her experience in international affairs. ""And she doesn't have the chaos following her that President Trump always has following him.""

The primary is her last chance to turn things around in the race for the nomination, said Mr Ager, the New Hampshire Republican official.

But Ms Blair will be doing her part to ensure that doesn't happen.","Bills and border crisis drive Trump voters to pollsBy Kayla Epstein In Manchester, New HampshireBBCMiranda BlairMiranda Blair didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016 because he scared her.

Box office smash Barbie has received eight Oscar nominations - but its star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig were snubbed in some major categories.

Gerwig missed out on being recognised in best director, but a nomination for Anatomy of a Fall's Justine Triet meant the line-up was not entirely male.

This is also the first year women have directed three best picture nominees.

Oppenheimer scored the most nominations overall, followed by Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon.

There were nods for Barbie's star and director elsewhere - Robbie was recognised as a producer in the best picture line-up, while Gerwig was nominated for best adapted screenplay.

Barbie's best picture nod also means Gerwig is the first woman to direct three films which have been nominated for the top prize, following Lady Bird and Little Women.

However, as Barbie was the highest-grossing film of 2023, taking $1.44bn (£1.14bn) worldwide, many expected Gerwig and Robbie to show up in the best director and best actress categories.

Barbie's America Ferrera, who was seen as an outside bet, scored a nomination for best supporting actress

While Robbie missed out on a best actress nod, her co-star America Ferrera scored a surprise supporting actress nomination.

Fellow Barbie star Ryan Gosling was nominated for best supporting actor, while a track he performs in the film, I'm Just Ken, was nominated for best original song.

It will face competition from another song from the same film - What Was I Made For? by Billie Eilish. Barbie's other nominations are for production design and costume design.

But it was Oppenheimer that led the field with 13 nominations. Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic about theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer was both acclaimed by critics and a huge success at the box office.

Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr were nominated for acting prizes, and Nolan for best director.

Oppenheimer's Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr were all nominated for acting prizes

Poor Things, about an infant whose brain has been transplanted into the body of a grown woman, was the second most nominated film, with 11 nods.

The film's star, Emma Stone, said the nominations felt like a ""surreal dream"", adding she was ""beyond grateful"" to the Academy.

Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, about the murder of members of the Osage Indian tribe by white settlers who are after their oil, scored 10 nominations.

Maestro, a biopic about the composer Leonard Bernstein starring Bradley Cooper, received seven nominations.

Jimmy Kimmel will host the Oscars ceremony from Los Angeles on 10 March.

The top nominees:

13 nominations - Oppenheimer

11 - Poor Things

10 - Killers of the Flower Moon

8 - Barbie

7 - Maestro

5 - American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers, The Zone of Interest

Watch: Which films are the favourites for the Oscars?

For the first time in Oscar history, three of the best picture nominees were directed by women: Past Lives (directed by Celine Song), Barbie (Gerwig) and Anatomy of a Fall (Triet).

This is partly because the best picture category has been expanded in recent years, and there are now 10 slots available every year.

In a statement, Song said: ""Thank you so much to the Academy for this tremendous recognition - it's such an unbelievable honour. I am overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude. And for my first film... crazy.""

In a video posted on social media, Triet was seen celebrating and becoming emotional as she found out about her nominations.

The nominations also saw Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone become the first ever Native American actress to be recognised, while Jodie Foster received her first nomination in nearly three decades for Nyad.

Following two Golden Globe wins, Anatomy of a Fall scored five Oscar nominations (director Justine Triet pictured)

Her co-star Robert De Niro broke the record of longest time between first and most recent Oscar nominations - 49 years - overtaking Katharine Hepburn's previous record of 48.

A best international feature nomination for The Zone of Interest, which follows a German family who live next to the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, marks the UK's first appearance in the category in 24 years.

Half of this year's acting nominees are nominated for the first time.

Scorsese secured his 10th nod for Killers of the Flower Moon, a record for a living director. But he has only won the award once, for 2007's The Departed.

Meanwhile, 91-year-old composer John Williams achieved his 54th nomination for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. He is the second most-nominated person in Oscar history after Walt Disney, but has said the film will be his last major work.

Snubs and surprises

Lily Gladstone became the first Native American actress to be nominated, but co-star Leonardo DiCaprio missed out

In the leading actress category, there was recognition for Nyad star Annette Bening - whose nomination had been seen as an outside bet.

America Ferrera's surprise supporting actress nomination for Barbie suggests her monologue in the film about what it means to be a woman clearly connected with Academy voters.

But May December struggled - receiving one nomination for original screenplay but missing out on acting nominations for its stars Julianne Moore, Charles Melton and Natalie Portman.

And there were no nominations whatsoever for All of Us Strangers or Saltburn, despite their strong performance at the Bafta nominations last week.

Far less surprising, but still notable, were Leonardo DiCaprio's absence from best actor for his role in Killers of the Flower Moon, and Poor Things star Willem DaFoe's miss in best supporting actor.","Oscars 2024: Barbie's Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie miss key nominationsBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporterGetty ImagesGerwig (left) and Robbie, pictured at the Golden Globes, missed out on best director and best actress respectivelyBox office smash Barbie has received eight Oscar nominations - but its star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig were snubbed in some major categories.

By Jane Corbin BBC News

BBC

The Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.

Scientists have listed reasons for keeping its hands the closest they have ever been to ""Doomsday"" - but stopped short of nudging it further forward.

The threat of a new nuclear arms race, the Ukraine war and climate change concerns were all factors, they said.

The clock is set annually by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Since 2007, members have considered the impact of new man-made risks such as AI and climate change, as well as the greatest threat - nuclear war.

In its 2024 announcement on Tuesday, the Bulletin said that China, Russia and the US were all spending huge sums to ""expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals"" - which added to the ""ever-present danger of nuclear war through mistake or miscalculation"".

The war in Ukraine had also created an ""ever-present risk of nuclear escalation"", it said.

A lack of action on climate change and risks linked to ""misusing"" emerging biological technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were also cited.

The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow US scientists who had developed the atomic bomb.

They had seen its devastating effects two years earlier, at the end of World War Two, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They wanted to warn the public and put pressure on world leaders to make sure nuclear weapons were never used again.

The hands of the clock have moved 25 times. In 1947, they started at seven minutes to midnight. At the end of the Cold War, in 1991, they had fallen back to 17 minutes to midnight.

Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told the BBC that ""every major country, including the UK, is investing in their nuclear arsenal as if nuclear weapons are usable for a very long time. This is a very dangerous time… leaders are not acting responsibly.""

With the Doomsday Clock the closest it's ever been to midnight, Jane Corbin investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe and the breakdown of systems of constraint.

Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear weapons expert who has been involved in setting the Doomsday Clock for many years, says he was shocked when President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on alert after the invasion of Ukraine.

The world reacted with horror to the Russian leader's threat but it seems he had made a deliberate calculation.

""This is exactly what nuclear weapons are there for - to make certain you have a certain freedom of action,"" Podvig says. ""The Russian President believed that by making these statements he could deter the West from intervening in Ukraine which was a correct calculation - this is how deterrence works.""

Despite decades of arms control agreements there are still about 13,000 nuclear warheads globally, 90% of them Russian and American. Six other countries are declared nuclear powers: the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is widely believed to have these weapons, but has never confirmed it. Most modern nuclear weapons are many times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

In 2021, the UK increased the cap on its warheads from 225 to 260, potentially 35 more warheads, and the country's nuclear force is on high alert. Since the war in Ukraine began, there has been rhetoric from senior Russian figures suggesting Moscow's nuclear weapons could be used against the UK.

The UK's nuclear deterrent is housed in the west of Scotland at the Faslane base, home to four Vanguard submarines that carry Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads.

HMS Vigilant, one of the UK's Vanguard submarines, stationed at Faslane

Feargal Dalton, a former Lt Cdr who served on board submarine HMS Victorious, is one of a handful of people who have actually fired a Trident missile: a test missile with a dummy warhead.

""There's always one [submarine] somewhere out there, at 15 minutes notice to fire,"" Dalton says. ""As we speak there is a nuclear deterrent out there. The Vladimir Putins of the world know it's out there, it's credible and we could use it if needs be.""

Ever since the atomic bomb was created there has been opposition to these weapons. In the 1980s, the women of the Greenham Common peace camp fought to get all US nuclear missiles removed from UK soil - the last warheads left in 2008.

CND protesters at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk

However, at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is now protesting against the possibility of US weapons returning.

Pentagon documents - first reported by the Federation of American Scientists - suggest US ""special"" weapons will be stationed at the base. US fighter planes that are capable of dropping such weapons arrived at Lakenheath in 2021 and there are now plans by the United States Air Force to build dormitories for troops to serve in a potential nuclear mission on this site.

""We know that we have got public opinion on our side,"" Sophie Bolt from CND explains - as her small group chant slogans over the perimeter fence of the base. ""Nearly 60% of the population do not want to have nuclear bombs sited in Britain.""

Getty Images

RAF Lakenheath is home to the US Air Force's 48th Fighter Wing

""We've got nothing to do with this base, it is totally under US control,"" Alan Wright, another protestor says. ""If we get Trump in [the White House] next time and he may press the button because he's got a bigger button than Putin - then we are a target.""

However, Donald Trump has previously said he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being elected, although he hasn't explained how. Some analysts believe it is likely that US support for Ukraine could be diminished.

In the past decade, fears of a nuclear war have also been ramped up by Kim Jong-Un, leader of North Korea, the latest nation to join the nuclear club. He has boasted of testing nuclear-capable missiles that could reach the United States.

Former Bulletin of Atomic Scientists member and Doomsday Clock adviser, Sig Hecker, has visited North Korea's nuclear facilities seven times as part of a scientific research programme and estimates it could have 50 to 60 nuclear warheads by now.","Doomsday Clock stays at 90 seconds to midnightBy Jane Corbin BBC NewsBBCThe Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.

The incident happened at a pro-Palestinian march outside Columbia University's Low Library

Police in New York City are investigating a possible hate crime after pro-Palestine demonstrators at Columbia University reported being sprayed with a foul-smelling substance.

The incident happened on Friday at a pro-Palestine march on campus.

The students reported symptoms like vomiting and headaches, and some sought medical treatment.

Columbia University said the suspected perpetrators have been banned from campus while police investigate.

In an email to faculty and students on Monday, Columbia's Provost Dennis Mitchell denounced the attack and called it ""deeply troubling"".

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community,"" he wrote.

""The University is committed to taking urgent action with the appropriate authorities in any such cases.""

The protest, which was unsanctioned by the university, took place at the front steps of Columbia's Low Library.

According to Columbia University's campus newspaper The Spectator, it was there that about a dozen or so students began smelling a foul odour, akin to sewage.

Some reported physical symptoms like nausea and burning eyes, as well as damage to their personal belongings.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed that it is investigating at least six reports related to the march.

In a statement to BBC, the NYPD said a 24-year-old female reported smelling an ""unknown odour and began to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes"". Since then, the police said they received five additional reports.

The NYPD added that no arrests have been made and that the investigation is ongoing.

The incident follows months of tension on Columbia University's campus and others across the country between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.

In October, a 19-year-old former student of Columbia University was charged in an assault on an Israeli student who was putting up posters of hostages held by Hamas.

Pro-Palestinian students on campus have also reported being harassed online, as well as being publicly singled-out by a truck that featured their faces and names and that labelled them as antisemites.

In November, Columbia University suspended two pro-Palestinian groups - Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voices for Peace - in an effort to reduce tensions on campus.","NY police probe alleged attack on pro-Palestine marchBy Nada Tawfik in New York & Nadine Yousif BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe incident happened at a pro-Palestinian march outside Columbia University's Low LibraryPolice in New York City are investigating a possible hate crime after pro-Palestine demonstrators at Columbia University reported being sprayed with a foul-smelling substance.

A federal judged has ruled that Canada's use of emergency powers to end the anti-government Freedom Convoy protests two years ago was ""unreasonable"" and unjustified.

In a decision on Tuesday, Judge Richard Mosley also said it violated Canada's rights charter.

The federal government said it will appeal the decision.

The Emergencies Act bestows the government with added powers in times of crisis.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked it on 14 February 2022, three weeks into protests that gridlocked the capital.

Dubbed the ""Freedom Convoy"", the protest against the government's Covid-19 vaccine mandate gained international attention as hundreds of demonstrators settled in for weeks around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, many in trucks.

Shorter protests and blockades also cropped up at various border points across the country.

The emergency powers allowed the government to impose bans on public assembly in some areas and to prohibit travel to protest zones, including by foreign nationals, among other measures.

In Tuesday's decision, Judge Mosely wrote: ""I have concluded that the decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness - justification, transparency and intelligibility - and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration.""

The court case was brought by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.

They had argued that the protests did not meet the ""high legal threshold"" needed to invoke the act, which was being used for the first time since it became law in 1988.

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended the government's actions on Tuesday, arguing that the country at the time faced a threat to its national and economic security and it was a ""option of the last resort"".

""We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interests,"" she told reporters in Montreal.

""It was not an easy time, these were not easy decisions.""

Last year, a federal inquiry into the use of the act found that Canada's government had met the ""high threshold"" for its use.

By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington

Mexico claims that as many over 500,000 US guns are trafficked into Mexico each year.

A US appeals court has ruled that a $10bn lawsuit filed by Mexico against US gun manufacturers can go ahead, reviving a long-running legal battle.

Mexico's government argues that the ""flood"" of illegal guns across the border is a result of ""deliberate"" business practices by the US gunmakers.

A lower court had dismissed the case in late 2022, prompting an appeal from the Mexican government.

The gun industry's trade association has denied any wrongdoing.

Among the companies named in the lawsuit are Smith & Wesson, Glock, Beretta, Barrett, Sturm and Ruger.

Mexican authorities allege that tens of thousands of US-manufactured guns are trafficked south across the border each year, providing drug cartels with easy access to massive arsenals used to fight each other and the Mexican government. Some estimates put the total at over half a million weapons each year.

More than 30,000 people were murdered last year in Mexico, which has extremely restrictive gun laws. The country is home to only one gun shop, housed in a Mexico City military complex.

The lawsuit, which was first filed in 2021 in a federal courthouse in Massachusetts - where several of the companies are based - argued that the manufacturers knew that guns were being sold to traffickers fuelling violence in the country.

But in 2022 a US federal judge dismissed the case on the grounds that the gun manufacturers were protected by a 2005 law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The law, also known as the PLCAA, shields gunmakers from damages ""resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse"" of their products.

Mexico's government swiftly appealed, arguing that the law only applies to injuries that take place in the US and does not protect the defendants - which include seven manufacturers and one distributor - from liability.

On Monday, a US appeals court ruled that the Mexican lawsuit ""plausibly alleges a type of claim that is statutorily exempt"" from the PCLAA, which only covers lawful gun sales.

Mexican and gun control advocates in the US quickly claimed the ruling as a victory, with Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Bárcena calling it ""great news"" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

In a statement, Jon Lowy, the president of Global Action on Gun Violence - who serves as Mexico's co-counsel on the case - said that the ruling is a ""huge step forward in holding the gun industry accountable for its contribution to gun violence, and in stopping the flood of trafficked guns to the cartels.""

""Not only did the Court recognize the right of another country to sue U.S. gun companies, it also pierced the unfair legal shield that gun companies have been hiding behind since 2005,"" he added.

Larry Keane, the senior vice-president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group that represents the US firearms industry, defended the manufacturers.","US appeals court revives Mexico's $10bn lawsuit against gunmakersBy Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, WashingtonGetty ImagesMexico claims that as many over 500,000 US guns are trafficked into Mexico each year.

On Monday, a US appeals court ruled that the Mexican lawsuit ""plausibly alleges a type of claim that is statutorily exempt"" from the PCLAA, which only covers lawful gun sales.
""Not only did the Court recognize the right of another country to sue U.S. gun companies, it also pierced the unfair legal shield that gun companies have been hiding behind since 2005,"" he added."

Kim Jong Un's new tone should not be ignored, say experts

North Korea experts - by nature, a cautious group who seek to avoid sowing panic - have been left reeling by two of their own.

Last week, the two eminent analysts dropped a bomb - so to speak - in stating their belief that the pariah state's leader is preparing for war.

Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said. Instead, he's presenting the North and South as two independent states at war with each other.

""We believe, that like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" wrote Robert L Carlin, a former CIA analyst and Siegfried S Hecker, a nuclear scientist who's visited the North several times, in an article on specialist site 38 North.

Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles.

Most analysts, however, disagree with the war theory; the BBC spoke to seven experts across Asia, Europe and North America - none of whom supported the idea.

""Risking his entire regime on a potentially cataclysmic conflict is not on-brand for the North Koreans. They have proven to be ruthlessly Machiavellian,"" says Christopher Green, a Korea watcher from Crisis Group based in the Netherlands.

He and others note the North often acts out to bring Western powers to the table for dialogue; and there are political pressures at home too.

But they do agree that Mr Kim's increased bluster can't be ignored and his regime has grown more dangerous.

While most argue war may still be unlikely, some fear a more limited attack could yet be on the cards.

What has led to this?

Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature.

KCNA

Kim set a new path at the Supreme People's Assembly session on 15 January

Six days on from his New Year's Eve declaration that ""it is fait accompli that a war can break out anytime on the Korean peninsula"", his military blasted artillery across the border.

North Korea has also claimed a test of a new solid-fuelled missile, and its underwater attack drones, which can supposedly carry a nuclear weapon, since the start of January.

They follow on from two years of near-monthly missile launches and weapons development in blatant contravention of UN sanctions.

However, it was his announcement of formally abandoning the goal of unification that last week furrowed brows.

Reuniting with the South had always been a key - if increasingly unrealistic - part of the North's ideology since the inception of the state.

""This is a big deal. It fundamentally alters one of the regime's core ideological precepts,"" says Peter Ward, a senior researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.

Kim Jong Un would now be tearing down that legacy - literally. Along with shutting diplomacy channels and cross-border radio broadcasts, he has announced he will demolish the Reunification Arch, a nine-storey monument on the outskirts of Pyongyang.

The arch, showing two women in traditional Korean dress reaching towards each other, had been built in 2001 to mark his father's and grandfather's efforts towards the goal of reunification.

Kim Jong Un said he plans to destroy this unification symbol to show his disgust with the South

Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs on Tuesday appear to show the arch may already have been destroyed, although there's no official confirmation of this.

Kim Il Sung had been the one who went to war in 1950, but he was also the one who set the idea that at some point North Koreans would be united with their southern kin again.

But his grandson has now chosen to define South Koreans as different people altogether - perhaps to justify them as a military target.

A limited strike on the cards?

Mr Carlin and Dr Hecker, the analysts who predicted war, have interpreted all of this as signs that Kim Jong Un has settled on actually pursuing a fight.

But most analysts disagree. Seong-Hyon Lee, from the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China relations, points out the country is due to reopen to foreign tourists next month, and it has also sold its own shells to Russia for war - something it could ill afford if it were preparing for the battlefields.

The ultimate deterrent, however, is that were the North to launch an attack, the US and South Korea armies are just so much more advanced.

""A general war could kill a lot of people in the South, but it would be the end of Kim Jong Un and his regime,"" says Kookmin University's Mr Ward.

Instead, he and others warn the conditions are building for a smaller action.

""I'm much more concerned, in general, about a limited attack on South Korea… an attack of that sort would take aim at South Korean territory or military forces but be limited in scope,"" says analyst Ankit Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

This could even be in the form of shelling or attempted occupation of contested islands west of the Korean peninsula.

In 2010, the North struck the island of Yeonpyeong killing four South Korean soldiers, infuriating the South.

A similar provocation again could be done to test the South Korea's limits, analysts suggest, and to push the buttons of President Yoon Suk Yeol, a defiantly hawkish leader who has vowed to respond to a North Korean attack with punishment ""multiple times more severe"".

""North Korea may expect to draw out a disproportionate retaliatory attack from Seoul,"" says Mr Panda, something that might spark a broader escalation in fighting.

Playbook move for leverage

Others say war fears should also be put in the context of Kim's operating patterns.

""Looking at the history of North Korea, it has often used provocation to attract the attention of other countries when it wants to negotiate,"" says Seong-Hyon Lee.

The regime continues to suffer from economic sanctions and 2024 is an election year for its enemies - with the US presidential vote and South Korean legislature poll.

""This presents a good opportunity for Kim Jong Un to provoke,"" explains Dr Lee.

The current US administration under President Joe Biden - tied up with Ukraine and Gaza - hasn't paid North Korea much heed and Pyongyang has also typically had most engagement with Republican administrations.

Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump famously had a bromance in 2019 before the denuclearisation talks soured - and the North Korean leader may be waiting for the former US president to return to the White House, where he might weaken the alliance with South Korea and be open to dialogue again.

North Korea's closer friendship with Russia and continued economic support from China in the past year may have also boosted its audacity, analysts suggest. It's received technical help from Russia to achieve a long-term goal of launching its spy satellites and the two states had several high-profile meetings including a leaders summit last year.

Reuters

Kim travelled to Russia's leading space facility last November after which his regime was able to launch their satellite

""Much of what we're seeing is a result of broader North Korean confidence in its own capabilities and its geopolitical position given Russian, and to a lesser degree, Chinese support,"" says Mr Panda.

Domestic goals

And others say Kim Jong Un's behaviour is all aimed at stabilising his own regime.

""This appears to be an ideological adjustment for regime survival,"" argues Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul. ""North Koreans are increasingly aware of their Communist country's failings compared to the South.""

He suggests a policy focused on defining the enemy is intended to justify Mr Kim's missile spending during a difficult time. There are reports of starvation across the country.

Presenting the South as the enemy also makes it easier to resolve ""cognitive dissonance at the heart"" of the North's view on South Korea, points out Mr Ward.

""Previously it was an indelibly evil state that was supposed to be the object of unification with a hopelessly corrupting culture that should not be consumed under any circumstances but with people who need to be liberated from their evil government,"" says Mr Ward.

""Now the country and its culture can just be branded evil and that justifies the continued crackdown on South Korean culture.""

""He doesn't actually want a war - a huge gamble where he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose"", says Sokeel Park, from Liberty in North Korea, an NGO helping North Korean refugees.

His threats are instead aimed at cementing his new North and South policy, designed ultimately to shore up his power at home, he says.

While it's important for South Korea, the US and allies to prepare for the worst-case scenario, it is also worth a thorough examination of the internal situation in North Korea and the wider geopolitics, analysts say.

At the end of the day, the best way to find out what the North's leader is thinking is to engage with him, argues Dr Lee.

""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats. It is seen as a necessary means to achieve a goal,"" he says.

""If necessary, one should consider meeting with the leader of an enemy nation to reduce misjudgements and prevent war.""","Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea's leader actually considering war?

By Brandon Drenon BBC News, Washington

A Colorado pastor and his wife have been charged with duping hundreds of local Christians in a multimillion dollar a cryptocurrency scheme.

Prosecutors accuse pastor Eli Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn, of fraudulently raising over $3m (£2.4m) by selling ""practically worthless"" crypto.

The Regalados pocketed at least $1.3m in the alleged scheme between June 2022 and April 2023, prosecutors say.

Mr Regalado said his plan was inspired by God, according to court filings.

The pastor said that ""God told him directly that investors would become wealthy"" by investing into INDXcoin, a cryptocurrency created, marketed, and sold by the Regalados, according to the complaint.

INDXcoin was offered to Denver-area Christians through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency exchange owned and operated by the Regalados.

The couple ""had no experience in cryptocurrency"", the complaint said, and a third-party auditor found INDXcoin to be ""unsafe, unsecure and riddled with technical problems"".

""Despite that report, the Regalados allegedly continued to promote the INDXcoin as a low-risk, high-profit investment,"" it said.

""In reality, the INDXcoin was illiquid and practically worthless"" and the couple used the funds for ""their lavish lifestyle"".

This included a Range Rover, luxury handbags, jewellery, boat rentals and snowmobile adventures, according to officials.

Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan has filed civil fraud charges for violations of anti-fraud protections under the Colorado Securities Act.

She said her department was tipped off after multiple complaints by people who had invested in INDXcoin and had lost money.

Mr Relagado addressed the allegations in a video statement released on Friday.

""The reason that [Colorado] is saying that it's worthless is because there is no exit for people who have bought,"" he said, acknowledging that the cryptocurrency investors who have tried to withdraw funds have been unable to.

""We launched an exchange. The exchange technology failed. Things went down hill, and from that point forward, we've just been waiting on the Lord literally for a miracle.""

On the allegation that Mr Relagado and his wife received $1.3m, the pastor said that was true.

""But out of that $1.3m, half of it went to the IRS and $200,000 went to a home remodel that the Lord told us to do,"" he said.

Many viewers left words of encouragement in the comments on the video, including ""prayers going up"" and ""hang in there, stay strong"".

The BBC has reached out to the Regalados for comment.

In the criminal complaint, Colorado prosecutors have asked for preliminary and injunctive relief, damages for investors and for a constructive trust to be placed on the Relagados' property.","Colorado pastor accused of multimillion dollar crypto schemeBy Brandon Drenon BBC News, WashingtonGetty ImagesA Colorado pastor and his wife have been charged with duping hundreds of local Christians in a multimillion dollar a cryptocurrency scheme.

A gunman suspected of killing eight people in the city of Joliet, Illinois, has died after a confrontation with law enforcement officials, police say.

Police in Joliet said Romeo Nance, 23, is believed to have fatally shot himself after the confrontation near Natalia, Texas.

He is suspected of killing eight people at multiple locations in Joliet.

Seven of the victims were found in two nearby houses by police on Monday. The eighth was found earlier on Sunday.

The identities of the seven victims discovered on Monday have not yet been released.

The discovery of the bodies sparked a manhunt for the suspect, who authorities warned ""should be regarded as armed and dangerous"".

In a statement, Joliet police department said Mr Nance had been located by US Marshals near Natalia at approximately 20:30 local time on Monday (2:30 GMT on Tuesday).

At that point, it said, ""it is believed that Nance took his own life with a handgun following a confrontation with Texas law enforcement officials.""

It added: ""Identification of the victims and manner of death will be determined by the Will County Coroner's Office. This remains an active investigation.""

Natalia - which is just outside San Antonio is more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from Joliet by road. Driving between the two locations would take at least 18 hours.

It remains unclear why he travelled to Texas or whether he has any connections there.

Earlier, Joliet police chief Bill Evans told a news briefing that police were notified at 12:04 local time on Monday that several people had been found shot dead.

After arriving at the scene on West Acres Road, officers discovered seven bodies. Five were found in one house, and two in the other, Will County Sheriff's deputy chief Dan Jungles said. It is believed they were all part of the same family.

The motive for the attack was not immediately clear, but the suspect is believed to have known the victims.

""I've been a policeman 25 years. This is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Mr Jungles said.

Before Mr Nance was located in Texas, investigators said they believed he was driving a red Toyota Camry and had urged anyone with information about the attack, 40 miles (64km) south-west of Chicago, to contact them.

Separately, authorities said they had been notified of two shootings a day earlier at different locations in Joliet.

They said a car with the same number plate as the one linked to the discovery of the seven bodies on Monday was spotted in both locations.

One of the shootings resulted in the death of a 28-year-old man, who was shot in the head, authorities said.

He was identified by police as Toyosi Bakare, who was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the US for the past three years.

Police do not believe that Mr Bakare was related to any of the other victims, but was connected to Mr Nance.

Police said a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg at a separate location earlier that day, resulting in non-life threatening injuries.","Illinois mass shooting suspect dies in Texas - policeBy Jaroslav Lukiv BBC NewsCBS NewsA gunman suspected of killing eight people in the city of Joliet, Illinois, has died after a confrontation with law enforcement officials, police say.

Israeli soldiers carry the casket at the funeral of one reservist killed in Monday's attack

The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.

That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.

The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion.

""A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire,"" a spokesman said.

""The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it,"" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added.

According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day.

In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border.

They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October.

The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem.

Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags.

Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday.

The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had ""absolute victory.""

AFP

There has been fierce fighting in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which is crowded with displaced people.

Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people.

The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas.

Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held.

According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons.

The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city.

They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.

The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery.

It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff.

Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack.

According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October.","Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one dayBy Yolande Knell BBC News, JerusalemReutersIsraeli soldiers carry the casket at the funeral of one reservist killed in Monday's attackThe Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.

WWE

WWE has made household names of former stars including John Cena

WWE Raw - pro-wrestling's most popular weekly show - will only be available on Netflix from next year.

The programme has been shown on broadcast TV around the world for 31 years.

But bosses of TKO - the company formed when WWE merged with UFC - have announced that Raw will be exclusive to streaming from next January.

Viewers outside the US will also be able to watch all weekly WWE shows and live events on the service.

The company said that would include pay-per-view specials including WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.

It said the deal would affect fans in the USA, Canada, UK and Latin America first, before being expanded to other countries later.

WWE Raw is usually broadcast live, has aired 1,600 episodes since it first launched and is a must-watch for fans looking to keep up with the latest wrestling storylines.

Bosses claim it brings in 17.5m viewers each week in the US, and that WWE boasts 1 billion followers across various social media platforms.

Nick Khan, WWE President, said: ""We believe Netflix, as one of the world's leading entertainment brands, is the ideal long-term home for Raw's live, loyal, and ever-growing fan base.""

BBC Newsbeat's asked Netflix to clarify whether pay-per-view events will be included in the price of a standard subscription.

The company also announced that superstar wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne Johnson had joined TKO as a director.

As part of that arrangement, he is now the owner of The Rock trademark.

The in-ring name has followed the star since he moved into film work, but remained property of the WWE.

""Being on the TKO Board of Directors, and taking full ownership of my name, 'The Rock', is not only unprecedented, but incredibly inspiring as my crazy life is coming full circle,"" he said in a statement.

His announcement has reignited rumours of a return to the ring after a surprise appearance on Raw earlier this month.","WWE Raw comes to Netflix from 2025 in huge dealBy Tom Richardson BBC NewsbeatWWEWWE has made household names of former stars including John CenaWWE Raw - pro-wrestling's most popular weekly show - will only be available on Netflix from next year.

By Nawal al-Maghafi BBC News Arabic Investigations and Newsnight

Jack Garland/BBC

The son of Yemeni human rights laywer Huda al-Sarari was fatally shot in 2019

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has funded politically motivated assassinations in Yemen, a BBC investigation has found.

Training provided by American mercenaries - hired by the UAE in 2015 - has then been used by Emiratis to instruct locals, sparking a surge in targeted killings, a whistleblower says.

The findings come as conflict in Yemen has returned to the international spotlight following attacks on ships in the Red Sea.

The UAE government has denied the allegations in our investigation - that it had assassinated those without links to terrorism - saying they were ""false and without merit"".

The killing spree in Yemen - more than 100 assassinations in a three-year period - is just one element of an ongoing bitter internecine conflict pitting several international powers against each other in the Middle East's poorest country.

The deadly atmosphere has discouraged the permanent return of Yemen's internationally recognised government. This, it could be argued, has indirectly helped to embolden the Iran-backed Houthis. Washington has announced that it will now re-designate the group as ""global terrorists"".

I have been reporting on the conflict in my native Yemen since it began in 2014. The fighting led to the government losing control of the country's north to the Houthis - who over the years have become savvier and better equipped.

In 2015, the US and the UK supported a coalition of mostly Arab states led by Saudi Arabia - with the UAE as a key partner - to fight back. The coalition invaded Yemen with the aim of reinstating the exiled Yemeni government and fighting terrorism. The UAE was given charge of security in the south, and became the US's key ally on counter-terrorism in the region - al-Qaeda had long been a presence in the south and was now gaining territory.

BBC Arabic's Nawal al-Maghafi reveals how the UAE hired mercenaries to conduct targeted assassinations of its political enemies in Yemen, with American mercenaries starting the killings in 2015.

Listen to Nawal al-Maghafi's radio documentary on Assignment on the BBC World Service and on BBC Sounds from Thursday 25 January.

But instead of this establishing greater stability, during my frequent reporting trips at that time I witnessed a wave of mysterious targeted killings, in Yemeni government-controlled southern areas, of Yemeni citizens unconnected to terror groups.

Under international law, any killing of civilians without due process would be counted as extra-judicial.

The majority of those assassinated were members of Islah - the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a popular international Sunni Islamist movement which has never been classified by the US as a terror organisation, but is banned in several Arab countries - including the UAE where its political activism and support for elections is seen by the country's royal family as a threat to their rule.

Leaked drone footage of the first assassination mission gave me a starting point from which to investigate these mysterious killings. It was dated December 2015 and was traced to members of a private US security company called Spear Operations Group.

I finally met one of the men behind the operation shown in the footage in a restaurant in London in 2020. Isaac Gilmore, a former US Navy Seal who later became chief operating officer of Spear, was one of several Americans who say they were hired to carry out assassinations in Yemen by the UAE.

Jack Garland/BBC

Isaac Gilmore was paid by the UAE to carry out targeted killings

He refused to talk about anyone who was on the ""kill list"" provided to Spear by the UAE - other than the target of their first mission: Ansaf Mayo, a Yemeni MP who is the leader of Islah in the southern port city of Aden, the government's temporary capital since 2015.

I confronted Mr Gilmore over the fact that Islah had never been classified as a terrorist organisation by the US authorities.

""Modern conflicts are unfortunately very opaque,"" he said. ""We see this in Yemen - one person's civil leader and cleric, is another person's terrorist leader.""

Mr Gilmore, and another Spear employee in Yemen at the time - Dale Comstock - told me that the mission they conducted ended in 2016. But the assassinations in southern Yemen continued. In fact they became more frequent, according to investigators from the human rights group Reprieve.

They investigated 160 killings carried out in Yemen between 2015 and 2018. They said the majority happened from 2016 and only 23 of the 160 people killed had links to terrorism. All the killings had been carried out using the same tactics that Spear had employed - the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) as a distraction, followed by a targeted shooting.

The most recent political assassination in Yemen, according to Yemeni human rights lawyer Huda al-Sarari, happened just last month - of an imam killed in Lahj by the same method.

Mr Gilmore, Mr Comstock, and two other mercenaries from Spear who asked not to be named, said that Spear had been involved in training Emirati officers in the UAE military base in Aden. A journalist who asked to remain anonymous also told us he had seen footage of such training.

The mercenaries would not go into detail about what it had entailed, but a senior Yemeni military officer from Aden, who worked directly with the UAE himself, gave me more details.

Ansaf Mayo, leader of al-Islah, who was targeted by Spear and now lives in exile

As the mercenaries' profile had made them conspicuous in Aden and vulnerable to exposure, their brief had been changed to training Emirati officers, ""who in turn trained local Yemenis to do the targeting"", the Yemeni military officer told me.

Through the course of the investigation, we also spoke to more than a dozen other Yemeni sources who said this had been the case. They included two men who said they had carried out assassinations which were not terror-related, after being trained to do so by Emirati soldiers - and one man who said he had been offered release from a UAE prison in exchange for the assassination of a senior Yemeni political figure, a mission he did not accept.

Getting Yemenis to conduct the assassinations meant it was harder for the killings to be traced back to the UAE.

By 2017, the UAE had helped build a paramilitary force, part of the Emirati-funded Southern Transitional Council (STC), a security organisation that runs a network of armed groups across southern Yemen.

The force operated in southern Yemen independently of the Yemeni government, and would only take orders from the UAE. The fighters were not just trained to fight on active front lines. One particular unit, the elite Counter Terrorism Unit, was trained to conduct assassinations, our whistleblower told us.

Yemen's conflict

In 2014, rebels known as Houthis belonging to a branch of Yemen's minority Shia Muslim community seized the capital, Sanaa

President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi set up a temporary capital in the southern city of Aden after fleeing house arrest in Sanaa in February 2015

Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign against the Houthis, whom they claimed were armed by regional rival Iran. The Saudi-led coalition has received logistical support from the US, UK and France

There have even been clashes between those ostensibly on the same side. In August 2019 fighting erupted in the south between Saudi-backed government forces and an allied southern separatist movement, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which has accused President Hadi of mismanagement and links to Islamists

Militants from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the local affiliate of the rival Islamic State group (IS) have taken advantage of the chaos by seizing territory in the south and carrying out deadly attacks, particularly in Aden

The Houthis have also expanded their own circle of influence - in November 2023 they began carrying out attacks on international shipping routes in the Red Sea

The BBC has found that despite the American mercenaries' stated aim to eliminate the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) in southern Yemen, in fact the UAE has gone on to recruit former al-Qaeda members for this security force.

The whistleblower sent a document with 11 names of former al-Qaeda members now working in the STC, some of whose identities we were able to verify ourselves.

During our investigation we also came across the name Nasser al-Shiba. Once a high-ranking al-Qaeda operative, he was jailed for terrorism but later released. A Yemeni government minister we spoke to told us al-Shiba was a known suspect in the attack on the US warship USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000. Multiple sources told us that he is now the commander of one of the STC military units.

Lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been investigating human rights abuses committed by these UAE-backed forces on the ground. As a result of her work, she would frequently receive death threats. But it was her 18-year-old son Mohsen who paid the ultimate price.

He was shot in the chest in March 2019 while on a trip to a local petrol station, and died a month later. When Huda returned to work after his death, she says she received messages warning her to stop. ""Was one son not enough? Do you want us to kill the other?"" they said.

A subsequent investigation by Aden's public prosecutor found that Mohsen was killed by a member of the UAE-backed Counter Terrorism Unit, but the authorities have never pursued a prosecution.

Members of the prosecutor's office - who we cannot name for safety reasons - told us that the widespread assassinations have created a climate of fear that means even they are too afraid to pursue justice in cases involving forces backed by the UAE.

Reprieve has received a leaked UAE document that shows Spear was still being paid in 2020, though it is not clear in what capacity.

We asked Spear's founder, Abraham Golan, whether his mercenaries had trained Emiratis in assassination techniques, but he didn't respond.

We put the allegations in our investigation to the UAE government.

It said it was untrue that it had targeted individuals with no links to terrorism, and that it supported counter-terrorism operations in Yemen at the invitation of the government of Yemen and its international allies.

""The UAE has acted in compliance with applicable international law during these operations,"" it said.","UAE has funded political assassinations in Yemen, BBC findsBy Nawal al-Maghafi BBC News Arabic Investigations and NewsnightJack Garland/BBCThe son of Yemeni human rights laywer Huda al-Sarari was fatally shot in 2019The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has funded politically motivated assassinations in Yemen, a BBC investigation has found.

Oldenkamp and another 500 or so competitive skaters had set off in the dark, in the early hours.

The near 10,000 'tour' skaters - members of the Royal Society who are enthusiastic amateurs seeking to complete the course rather than win - would follow behind them.

For the serious racers, there was a kind of 'Le Mans' start, with competitors running around a kilometre to the first watercourse, before putting on their skates.

As the crowds and the town faded into the freezing darkness, the challenge truly began for Oldenkamp.

He could, he says, hear his competitors as they set out across the first of the lakes to negotiate, but he couldn't see them.

And skating - even for a hugely experienced racer like Oldenkamp - was tough.

A bitter winter, combining viciously low temperatures, snow and strong easterly or northerly winds had left the waterways of Friesland thoroughly frozen - but the ice was far from smooth.

""You couldn't make the proper movement with skates,"" Oldenkamp says.

""Sometimes it was a long haul, sometimes it was a short haul, and sometimes you were just walking. [It was] impossible to make a fluent movement on your skates and to use your technique.

""If you see the movies of the Elfstedentocht in 1963, it is almost no skating.""

The course makes a great loop of Friesland, initially heading south from Leeuwarden, before tracking to the coast then north to the towns of Harlingen and Dokkum, and back to the provincial capital.

The elite field was already well strung out by the time they reached the coast and Oldenkamp found himself with two companions, urging each other on in solidarity rather than competing against each other.

It was now daylight but that didn't help Oldenkamp spot a weak point in the ice, and he plunged through into the freezing water.

""I didn't see it. I went straight into it,"" he says.

Astonishingly though, it hardly held him up at all.

""There was almost no interruption. I'm an experienced man in going through the ice. As soon as you are in the ice, in the water, you come out - skate on,"" he said.

""You have a wet racing suit but there's no problem. You start moving and it's OK. If you stop and try to change clothes, that's the wrong thing to do.""

Oldenkamp carried on, but behind him, as the thousands of tour skaters negotiated the early stages of the course, the weather was rapidly worsening.","Oldenkamp and another 500 or so competitive skaters had set off in the dark, in the early hours.

A social media firestorm is swirling around beauty retailer Sephora in response to the US locations' apparent shifting demographic.

Teen and adult beauty shoppers have been uploading post after post on social media complaining that tween girls under 12 are flooding stores such as Sephora and Ulta Beauty. On TikTok and Instagram, the hashtags #sephora or #sephorakids reveal the conflict in full force, showing messed-up stores and product displays, and recounting run-ins in which young shoppers were rude to other customers and employees alike.

According to the complaints, this behaviour even includes grabbing products right from other shoppers' hands, as one TikTok user shared. She specifically called out Drunk Elephant, a brand Glamour magazine recently called a ""tween obsession"".

These same social media posts, many of which have gone viral, point out that Gen Alpha are busy buying products containing ingredients such as retinol, harsh exfoliating acids or pricey moisturisers, toners and serums designed to minimise the effects of aging. In other words, products that traditionally have been aimed at slightly older consumers.

As marketing campaigns and beauty influencers drive shoppers towards personal care products are children really flooding stores and hauling home all the hyaluronic acid their wee hands can hold, as social media users and apparent product popularity indicate?

""Yes, tweens are not only flooding Sephora stores, but they're also making a lot of purchases of these products online,"" says Denish Shah, an associate professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business. ""This category, in general, is seeing a huge increase in sales.""

Shah points to California-based cosmetics brand e.l.f. A publicly listed company, e.l.f.'s stock prices have been ""off the charts"" lately, he says. Throughout the past year, e.l.f.’s stock price has surged 203%, per Marketwatch. And those soaring stock prices are a direct result of e.l.f.'s enormous sales growth.

""The company's sales have increased exponentially over the past year, and that's significant because they position themselves as really affordable cosmetics. And if you look at their marketing efforts, they’re all targeted toward that tween demographic,"" says Shah.

Marketing to a younger demographic may merely correlate to this industry-wide growth, but Shah says the connection is there, and e.l.f. is but one example of the tween-cosmetics and skincare phenomenon taking place more broadly. Many companies in the beauty and skincare industry are targeting ever younger customers and raking in massive sales as a result, says Shah.

Data from Statista shows that the baby and child skincare market is expected to experience an annual growth rate of about 7.71% until in 2028, it reaches $380m (£299m) in market volume worldwide. Meanwhile, the number of product users is expected to reach 160.7 million worldwide by the same year. This isn’t just about young kids trying their mums’ creams, but an industry expanding to reach a broader age spread of consumers.

“The market is growing pretty rapidly. There are a lot of new brands launching specifically for tweenage girls,” says Jessica DeFino, creator of The Unpublishable, a newsletter behind the scenes of the beauty industry.

DeFino names several cosmetics and skincare brands that have launched in recent years specifically to serve not only tweens, but also younger demographics. Parents of toddlers may have heard of Yawn, a company that launched to offer make-up and skincare for customers who are aged 3+. Bubble, which bills itself as “new school skincare” offers acne and skin-texture products launched in 2020, and is now sold at Ulta as well as drug stores; Gryt, which launched in 2023, says its products are for tweens and teens but can be used by those as young as eight years old.

“I have seen an explosion of tween products,” says DeFino. “I’m also increasingly seeing girls younger than teens using adult products … From a business perspective, the marketing is there; these younger age groups are actively being targeted.”

And it's not just the cosmetics-specific stores: US retailers including CVS and Walgreens have undergone renovations in recent years to put beauty products – including the types of cosmetics that are actively marketed to kids via cross-branding with favorite childhood books or TV shows – front and centre. Often, these general pharmacy stores are where kids have their first shopping experiences with their parents well before they're old enough to head to Sephora alone.

Brands are marketing to tweens in multiple ways, continues DeFino. In addition to specifically creating those products designed to appeal to younger users, DeFino says there’s a proliferation of social media marketing aimed at young consumers. That includes witnessing a growing number of tweens, often ""skinfluencers"", demonstrating how to use such products for their followers.

This is happening at a time when tweens have been spending increased amounts of time on social media since being cooped up during the pandemic.

They're among the biggest consumers of some social media platforms, says Shah, founding director of Georgia State University’s Social Media Intelligence Lab. All that social media time is, in turn, exposing these young users to influencers paid by brands to use and promote beauty and skincare products. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms also feed this exposure, serving users recommendations about beauty tips and influencers after just a few searches on the topic.

Add to this mix the fact that tweens are known to be concerned about how they look – and you have the perfect storm. ""Tweens are preoccupied with personal appearance. They’re very, very self-conscious in terms of how their growing bodies are going to turn out and about their developing self-identity,"" says Shah. ""There’s a lot of sensitivity around that and that’s existed for decades. And these two factors combined are what's really driving the sales in these younger demographics.”

So are Sephora and Ulta stores being overrun by pubescent shoppers? Both brands declined to comment – but the youth-targeted product market is booming, and these products are sold in both.

And even if all the data pointing to the expanding pool of beauty consumers doesn't tell us the ages of those buying up Drunk Elephant, Shah has something else convincing him of the substantial marketing shift in the beauty and skincare industry. And so do many parents.","'Sephora kids' and the booming business of beauty products for childrenBy Mia Taylor Features correspondentGetty ImagesA social media firestorm is swirling around beauty retailer Sephora in response to the US locations' apparent shifting demographic.

""I was very angry that the doctors didn't let me die. Now it's different, I know the reason I'm still alive,"" Patricia Lefranc, who is pictured here with Rankin, says in the photographer's new fashion 'look book'

Over the last 20 years, British photographer Rankin has profiled the world's most famous people ranging from David Bowie to the late Queen Elizabeth II. Supermodels and fashion shoots helped make his fortune. But it is charity projects that continue to keep him grounded.

Rankin, who was once labelled a 'bad boy' celebrity photographer, has mellowed since the Britpop heydays of the noughties and becoming a father. In an interview with the BBC, the Glasgow-born creative reflected on his journey from a working class background to the dizzying heights of fame.

""When my kid was born, and they started to grow up, I was very concerned that I needed to correct that balance of having this incredible job where you do get paid extraordinary amounts of money to do what you love. You need to balance the art of giving something back.""

Rankin, full name John Rankin Waddell, has used his profile to support numerous charities ranging from women's health issues and combating plastic waste, to recognising the contributions of NHS workers.

His latest campaign is for the Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTi) where his images are used in the book 'Tear Couture' which aims to bring attention to the continued risk of acid attacks as a form of gender-based violence.

ASTi, which counts the Princess Royal as its patron, estimates that more than 10,000 attacks take place globally each year, mostly on women and children. The charity found a large proportion occur in South Asian countries where garment and jewellery industries operate.

Anecdotal evidence shows attacks using corrosive liquids of hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric acid occur at higher rates in locations where these substances are easily accessible, and where factories use acids in their manufacturing processes.

Some 710 acid attacks were recorded in England and Wales last year, an increase from 421 in 2021, according to ASTi which compiled the data by submitting a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to 43 police forces.

""Some days, I just cry""

Rankin/McCann Health London

""People stare at me and mock me for my appearance,"" model Patricia Lefranc says. She is pictured here sharing a new campaign shot by Rankin, aimed at raising awareness around the link between the fashion industry and acid attacks

A look book is a fashion industry guide to the latest styles and fabrics. There are microscopic tears that have been turned into an immersive virtual reality experience where users can listen to survivors' testimonials

Rankin said taking on the ASTi charity project adds to his body of work in rethinking beauty standards.

The Belgian activist 59-year-old Patricia Lefranc, his model, has undergone countless surgeries after an ex-lover threw sulphuric acid on her. Few acid attack victims are willing to be photographed.

""I look at these pictures of Patricia and I think they're beautiful,"" Rankin told the BBC. ""I want to empower her through those pictures. She was very brave in showing me how extensive her acid attack was.""

""You have to have an empathy for anybody that's in front of the camera. It can be rather daunting,"" he added. ""I'm not taking something from them, I'm making something with them together. That's how I approach every single picture I take.""

Rankin/McCann Health London

The Belgian activist and author was kept in an artificial coma for three months after an ex-lover threw sulphuric acid on her in 2009. He was later found guilty of attempted murder and jailed for 30 years

""My idea of beauty was very influenced by growing up photographing beautiful people all the time,"" Rankin admits.

""So to challenge that, which I've been doing since the early '90s, I felt like it was my duty to not just buy into the beauty of the beauty industry or the movie industry. It's to buy into my own version of that.""

The 57-year-old said he wants to be able to ""take pictures that are unexpected and turn people's heads"".

""I'm trying to change the whole idea of what is beauty. That is the kind of thing that you're aiming for with these types of pictures"".

Rankin does not take a personal fee for charity work, instead using an expenses-based approach. Reflecting on his success, Rankin said photography remains his favourite medium.

""I own an ad agency. I've directed movies, I've made commercials, but I come back to photography and it's the thing that I love the most.""

He warns that younger people need to realise the industry has become even tougher in a digital age where everyone has a camera in the form of a smartphone.

""It's a very difficult career to manage,"" he said. ""You've got to reinvent yourself again and again and again.""

""You've got to remain current and it is a struggle. You have to kind of sacrifice quite a lot in your working life. I don't think that's changed.""

Rankin also holds the honour of having photographed all the top royals including an iconic image of Queen Elizabeth II marking her Golden Jubilee. At the time, he said in an interview that he worked hard to get her to smile.

Last year, he photographed King Charles III for the Big Issue magazine which helps the homeless and shared that the monarch was ""delightful to photograph and it was very easy to make him laugh"".

""I really love that picture because I feel there's a resilience to the image that maybe people haven't seen before. And I think what I'm always looking for is the person behind the Crown, not the Crown.

""I was looking for the person who has been in the wings and has that resilience and has got an opinion,"" Rankin told the BBC.

""To be really honest, I think we need some leaders like that in our lives.""

In 2008 and 2009, Rankin travelled with Oxfam to the war-torn eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The photo project aimed to highlight the humanity of people caught in the middle of disease and malnutrition

""I wanted my portraits to do something different. The West has been anesthetised to traditional pictures of disaster zones,"" Rankin said in a 2010 interview with Oxfam.

""My style of portraiture is always about bringing people out of themselves, getting them to share something.

By Steve Rosenberg Russia editor, Moscow

BBC

Wives of reservists say their husbands have done their fair share of the fighting and want them back home

In a function room on the edge of Moscow, something unusual is happening.

A group of women are publicly criticising the Russian authorities. Their husbands are among the 300,000 reservists mobilised by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine in autumn 2022.

And they want them home.

""When will our husbands be considered to have discharged their military duty?"" asks Maria. ""When they're brought back with no arms and legs? When they can't do anything at all because they're just vegetables? Or do we have to wait for them to be sent back in zinc coffins?""

The women met via social media and have formed a group called The Way Home. They have differing views on the war. Some claim to support it. Others are sceptical about the Kremlin's ""special military operation"". What seems to unite them is the belief that the mobilised men have done their fair share of the fighting and should be back home with their families.

It is an opinion the authorities do not share.

In Russia public criticism of anything related to the war comes with a risk. Most of the speakers choose their words very carefully. They know there's a string of laws in place now in Russia for punishing dissent. Their frustration, though, is palpable.

""To begin with we trusted our government,"" Antonina says. ""But should we trust them now? I don't trust anyone.""

Members of the group are here to share their stories with a local councillor, Boris Nadezhdin. He has been critical of the ""special military operation"" from the outset.

Curiously Mr Nadezhdin is one of the few government critics who has been allowed onto national television since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He's an occasional guest on TV talk shows.

Right now, the politician is trying to get on the ballot for the presidential election. He maintains that the war has damaged Vladimir Putin's domestic popularity.

""Putin was very popular in Russia because after the 1990s he brought stability and security,"" Mr Nadezhdin tells me. ""Stability and security were the main reason for supporting Putin. Now more and more people have already understood that stability and security are finished.""

Russian women campaigning for the return of their mobilised husbands, sons or brothers have come in for criticism from different quarters. Opponents of the war have little sympathy. They condemn the men for obeying the mobilisation order and for taking part in the war.

Boris Nadezhdin, a presidential hopeful, is one of the few government critics still allowed on national TV in Russia

Supporters of the Kremlin portray the women as Western stooges.

In a recent interview with the Fontanka news site, Russian MP Andrei Kartapolov, who heads the Russian Duma's defence committee, claimed that the call for demobilisation was the work of ""[Russia's] enemies"". He appeared to suggest that the Ukrainian military or the CIA was behind it.

Mr Kartapolov also invoked World War Two.

""Can you imagine a delegation of wives coming to the Kremlin in autumn 1942 and telling Stalin: 'Let those men who were called up in 1941 go home. They've been fighting for a year already.' No-one would ever have thought of doing that.""

Maria Andreeva, whose husband and cousin have been drafted and despatched to Ukraine, finds Mr Kartapolov's comments insulting.

""He dares to liken the special military operation to the Second World War,"" Maria tells me. ""Back then Russia's aim was survival. We'd been attacked. There was full mobilisation and martial law. It's the total opposite of what is happening now.""

Maria says that she is not only campaigning to bring back her family members. She wants to prevent more Russians being called up and sent to the front line.

""We do not want a second wave of mobilisation,"" she says. ""We're against civilians being used in a military conflict. And we want all Russian citizens to understand this could affect them, too.

""Some people act like ostriches. They stick their heads in the sand and try not to think about what's happening. I can understand them. It's hard to accept that, in your country, the state doesn't need you to be happy - it just treats you as biological material. But if people want to survive, sooner or later they need to recognise this and say that they don't agree.""

Maria Andreeva is campaigning to prevent more Russians from being conscripted and sent to the front line

How likely is a ""second wave"" of mobilisation in Russia? Last December President Putin appeared to rule it out - for now. Live on Russian TV the Kremlin leader claimed that in 2023 the Russian authorities had managed to recruit nearly half a million volunteers to fight in Ukraine.

""Why do we need mobilisation? As things stand there is no need,"" the Kremlin leader concluded.

Of course, ""as things stand"" doesn't mean ""never going to happen"". Situations can change.

For example, in March 2022 President Putin declared: ""Conscripted soldiers are not participating and will not participate in the fighting. There will not be an additional call-up of reservists, either. Only professional soldiers are taking part.""

""Partial mobilisation"" was announced six months later.

To raise awareness Maria and other wives of mobilised reservists have started a new tradition. Every Saturday they don white headscarves and travel into the centre of Moscow. Near the Kremlin walls they lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Red carnations are placed by the Eternal Flame. It is their form of peaceful protest.

On its Telegram channel The Way Forward explains that these flowers are for honouring ""the lives of loved ones. To honour the memory of those killed in all wars. To honour the memory of our guys.""

The group also believes that flower-laying is a way of saying ""never again"".

Wives of reservists gather outside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, near the Kremlin, each week as a form of protest

But how aware is Russian society? How much interest is there from the public in what the families of mobilised reservists are saying? Antonina says that since her partner was drafted, she hasn't felt much support from those around her. When he received his call-up papers in October 2022, he'd asked friends to keep an eye out for Antonina.

""They invited me to celebrate new year with them a year ago,"" she says. ""But all evening they kept telling me that my husband was a total mug for going there [to Ukraine].""

Antonina claims that, despite being diagnosed with stomach ulcers, her partner was deployed to an assault unit in Ukraine. She says that he telephoned her on 4 December.

""He was crying. He was frightened. It sounded like he was saying goodbye.""

She says he called again on 13 December. That was the last time she heard from him. Antonina says she's since been told that her partner was wounded in action.

""There are some people who want to fight. Who volunteer for it and sign contracts,"" Antonina says. ""Let them fight. But send us back our husbands who don't want to be there. They've done their duty to the motherland. Send them home.","'Send back our husbands' - Russian women in rare protestBy Steve Rosenberg Russia editor, MoscowBBCWives of reservists say their husbands have done their fair share of the fighting and want them back homeIn a function room on the edge of Moscow, something unusual is happening.

Coffee production is dominated by Coffea Arabica

Scientists have unravelled the genetic secrets of coffee in a discovery they say paves the way for more flavoursome brews.

Researchers in Italy pieced together the most complete genetic map yet of Arabica coffee, the world's most popular drink.

The new insights into the plant's genetic make-up will help in the breeding of new coffee crops.

And it may lead to coffee plants that can cope better in a warming world.

""We have produced a new sequence map of coffee, Arabica,"" Dr Michele Morgante of the University of Udine in Italy, told BBC News.

""This tool may give us ways to provide coffee growers with better plants that appeal more to the consumers, and cope better with changing climatic conditions.""

Getty Images

Coffea arabica, known as Arabica coffee, originated in the highlands of Ethiopia

The study used the latest DNA sequencing technology to examine the genetic make-up of the Arabica coffee plant in unprecedented detail.

The knowledge allows scientists to hone in on the genes important in coffee production, such as the distinctive sweet, soft flavour of the brew.

It may also help coffee growers develop new varieties of coffee with particular flavours and aromas as well as those able to tolerate tougher growing conditions.

Rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall are altering the conditions under which coffee plants are grown, leading to decreased yields and increased attack from pests and diseases.

The study is published in the scientific journal, Nature Communications.

Dr Aaron Davis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said it was an ""important step forward in our understanding of the genetic diversity of coffee which may help to guide the future development of this economically important and much-loved crop species.""

Jeremy Torz, co-founder of the London-based coffee roasting business, Union Hand-roasted Coffee, said much of what we taste and enjoy about coffee is a result of the work of coffee farmers - and the science will help them develop plants that are well-suited to producing good coffee in a changing environment.

""It's a reassurance that with the combination of good science and passionate farmers, the brew that we love will be around in a form that we know it for a lot longer,"" he said.

What is Arabica coffee?

Arabica beans are deemed to have a superior taste. The coffee is grown in the mountains and accounts for over 60% of the world's coffee production.

Arabica has limited resilience to climate change; farmers are already experiencing the impacts of elevated temperatures and low or erratic rainfall.

Other threats to coffee production include price fluctuations, pests and diseases, and extreme weather.

The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.

What types of coffee do we drink?

More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, but only a handful are used for drinking.

The global coffee industry is dominated by two main coffee crops - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffeea canephora).

A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks.","New coffee genetic map promises better brewsBy Helen Briggs Environment correspondentGetty ImagesCoffee production is dominated by Coffea ArabicaScientists have unravelled the genetic secrets of coffee in a discovery they say paves the way for more flavoursome brews.

By Sam Gruet Business reporter, BBC News

Amazon has been fined €32m (£27m) in France for ""excessive"" surveillance of its workers, including measures the data watchdog found to be illegal.

The CNIL said Amazon France Logistique, which manages warehouses, recorded data captured by workers' handheld scanners.

It found Amazon tracked activity so precisely that it led to workers having to potentially justify each break.

Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the CNIL's findings and called them ""factually incorrect"".

France's data protection agency investigated Amazon warehouses following complaints by employees as well as media coverage of conditions.

It outlined a number of areas where it found Amazon had breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This included a system with three alerts in place to monitor employee activity, which the CNIL ruled to be illegal.

One alert triggered if an item was scanned too quickly or less than 1.25 seconds after scanning a previous item, increasing the risk of error.

Another signalled breaks of 10 minutes or more, while a third tracked breaks between one and 10 minutes.

The CNIL also questioned why Amazon needed to keep workers' data for 31 days.

Responding to the findings an Amazon spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the CNIL's conclusions which are factually incorrect and we reserve the right to file an appeal.

""Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.""

'Micromanagement'

A similar system for Amazon warehouses in the UK has been highlighted before.

Amazon's Europe policy chief Brian Palmer told a parliamentary select committee in November 2022 that if an employee had three productivity flags on the system they could be fired. The online giant later said they were not ""fully correct"".

The subsequent report published by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee raised concerns about surveillance technology being used to set performance targets and monitor performance.

The report said there was evidence to suggest that Amazon's surveillance practices were ""leading to distrust, micromanagement and, in some cases, disciplinary action against its workers"".

The committee said it had written to Amazon outlining its concern the technology would put ""undue stress on its workforce"".

Amazon declined to comment on its UK warehouses.

The CNIL said Amazon already had access to lots of data to achieve quality and safety in its warehouses, and called the system ""excessively intrusive"". It also noted that tracking employees so closely could lead to them having to justify even a brief interruption of scanning.

Amazon also used data collected by the scanner to plan work in its warehouses, evaluate employees on a weekly basis and train them. The watchdog ruled Amazon did not need access to the smallest details of data collected by the scanners to do so.

The online shopping giant was fined for not properly informing workers and external visitors about surveillance, with the watchdog also found to have had insufficient security on its video surveillance.","Amazon fined for 'excessive' surveillance of workersBy Sam Gruet Business reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesAmazon has been fined €32m (£27m) in France for ""excessive"" surveillance of its workers, including measures the data watchdog found to be illegal.

Sylvester Stallone is nominated for a worst supporting actor Razzie

The Winnie the Pooh slasher film took advantage of the copyright for AA Milne's classic tale expiring, and reimagined the characters of the Hundred Acre Wood as vicious serial killers.

It has been nominated for worst picture, worst screenplay and worst rip-off, while Pooh and Piglet are nominated as worst on-screen couple.

The Exorcist: Believer is not the only exorcism-themed film with nominations. Oscar winner Russell Crowe is in the worst actor category for his portrayal of Father Gabriele Amorth, a priest who performed more than 100,000 exorcisms, in The Pope's Exorcist.

Universal Pictures

The Exorcist: Believer has received five nominations

Described as the ""ugly cousin to the Oscars"", the Razzies will reveal their winners the day before the Oscars in March.

Voted for by more than 1,000 Golden Raspberry Foundation members based in the US and abroad, there are nine Razzie categories including worst director, worst screenplay and worst prequel/remake/rip-off/sequel.

Expend4bles has been nominated for all of those categories.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is also nominated for worst sequel. Starring Harrison Ford for the final time as the archaeologist adventurer, the film flopped at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.

Vin Diesel has made it onto the list for worst actor for the 10th Fast and Furious film, while Shazam! Fury of the Gods has four nominations, including one for Oscar winner Dame Helen Mirren for worst actress.

Other acclaimed actors to have won Razzies in the past include Leonardo DiCaprio, Eddie Redmayne, Ben Affleck, Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock.

Ant Man & The Wasp: Quantumania also has four nominations, while four actors have double nominations - Fox, Ana de Armas, Chris Evans and Salma Hayek.

De Armas is nominated for worst actress and worst screen couple alongside Chris Evans for Ghosted, an action comedy that the Guardian awarded one star to, calling it ""an industry-shaming worst"".

Hayek and Channing Tatum are also up for worst screen couple for Magic Mike's Last Dance.

Fox is the only actor to be nominated for two different films - worst actress for Johnny & Clyde, and worst supporting actress for Expend4bles.

A federal judged has ruled that Canada's use of emergency powers to end the anti-government Freedom Convoy protests two years ago was ""unreasonable"" and unjustified.

In a decision on Tuesday, Judge Richard Mosley also said it violated Canada's rights charter.

The federal government said it will appeal the decision.

The Emergencies Act bestows the government with added powers in times of crisis.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked it on 14 February 2022, three weeks into protests that gridlocked the capital.

Dubbed the ""Freedom Convoy"", the protest against the government's Covid-19 vaccine mandate gained international attention as hundreds of demonstrators settled in for weeks around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, many in trucks.

Shorter protests and blockades also cropped up at various border points across the country.

The emergency powers allowed the government to impose bans on public assembly in some areas and to prohibit travel to protest zones, including by foreign nationals, among other measures.

In Tuesday's decision, Judge Mosely wrote: ""I have concluded that the decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness - justification, transparency and intelligibility - and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration.""

The court case was brought by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.

They had argued that the protests did not meet the ""high legal threshold"" needed to invoke the act, which was being used for the first time since it became law in 1988.

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended the government's actions on Tuesday, arguing that the country at the time faced a threat to its national and economic security and it was a ""option of the last resort"".

""We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interests,"" she told reporters in Montreal.

""It was not an easy time, these were not easy decisions.""

Last year, a federal inquiry into the use of the act found that Canada's government had met the ""high threshold"" for its use.

Justice Paul Rouleau, who led that probe, called the decision a ""drastic move"" but not a ""dictatorial one"".","Canada's use of emergency powers 'unjustified' - judgeGetty ImagesA federal judged has ruled that Canada's use of emergency powers to end the anti-government Freedom Convoy protests two years ago was ""unreasonable"" and unjustified.

By Frances Mao BBC News

KCNA

Kim Jong Un's new tone should not be ignored, say experts

North Korea experts - by nature, a cautious group who seek to avoid sowing panic - have been left reeling by two of their own.

Last week, the two eminent analysts dropped a bomb - so to speak - in stating their belief that the pariah state's leader is preparing for war.

Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said. Instead, he's presenting the North and South as two independent states at war with each other.

""We believe, that like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" wrote Robert L Carlin, a former CIA analyst and Siegfried S Hecker, a nuclear scientist who's visited the North several times, in an article on specialist site 38 North.

Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles.

Most analysts, however, disagree with the war theory; the BBC spoke to seven experts across Asia, Europe and North America - none of whom supported the idea.

""Risking his entire regime on a potentially cataclysmic conflict is not on-brand for the North Koreans. They have proven to be ruthlessly Machiavellian,"" says Christopher Green, a Korea watcher from Crisis Group based in the Netherlands.

He and others note the North often acts out to bring Western powers to the table for dialogue; and there are political pressures at home too.

But they do agree that Mr Kim's increased bluster can't be ignored and his regime has grown more dangerous.

While most argue war may still be unlikely, some fear a more limited attack could yet be on the cards.

What has led to this?

Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature.

KCNA

Kim set a new path at the Supreme People's Assembly session on 15 January

Six days on from his New Year's Eve declaration that ""it is fait accompli that a war can break out anytime on the Korean peninsula"", his military blasted artillery across the border.

North Korea has also claimed a test of a new solid-fuelled missile, and its underwater attack drones, which can supposedly carry a nuclear weapon, since the start of January.

They follow on from two years of near-monthly missile launches and weapons development in blatant contravention of UN sanctions.

However, it was his announcement of formally abandoning the goal of unification that last week furrowed brows.

Reuniting with the South had always been a key - if increasingly unrealistic - part of the North's ideology since the inception of the state.

""This is a big deal. It fundamentally alters one of the regime's core ideological precepts,"" says Peter Ward, a senior researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.

Kim Jong Un would now be tearing down that legacy - literally. Along with shutting diplomacy channels and cross-border radio broadcasts, he has announced he will demolish the Reunification Arch, a nine-storey monument on the outskirts of Pyongyang.

The arch, showing two women in traditional Korean dress reaching towards each other, had been built in 2001 to mark his father's and grandfather's efforts towards the goal of reunification.

Kim Jong Un said he plans to destroy this unification symbol to show his disgust with the South

Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs on Tuesday appear to show the arch may already have been destroyed, although there's no official confirmation of this.

Kim Il Sung had been the one who went to war in 1950, but he was also the one who set the idea that at some point North Koreans would be united with their southern kin again.

But his grandson has now chosen to define South Koreans as different people altogether - perhaps to justify them as a military target.

A limited strike on the cards?

Mr Carlin and Dr Hecker, the analysts who predicted war, have interpreted all of this as signs that Kim Jong Un has settled on actually pursuing a fight.

But most analysts disagree. Seong-Hyon Lee, from the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China relations, points out the country is due to reopen to foreign tourists next month, and it has also sold its own shells to Russia for war - something it could ill afford if it were preparing for the battlefields.

The ultimate deterrent, however, is that were the North to launch an attack, the US and South Korea armies are just so much more advanced.

""A general war could kill a lot of people in the South, but it would be the end of Kim Jong Un and his regime,"" says Kookmin University's Mr Ward.

Instead, he and others warn the conditions are building for a smaller action.

""I'm much more concerned, in general, about a limited attack on South Korea… an attack of that sort would take aim at South Korean territory or military forces but be limited in scope,"" says analyst Ankit Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

This could even be in the form of shelling or attempted occupation of contested islands west of the Korean peninsula.

In 2010, the North struck the island of Yeonpyeong killing four South Korean soldiers, infuriating the South.

A similar provocation again could be done to test the South Korea's limits, analysts suggest, and to push the buttons of President Yoon Suk Yeol, a defiantly hawkish leader who has vowed to respond to a North Korean attack with punishment ""multiple times more severe"".

""North Korea may expect to draw out a disproportionate retaliatory attack from Seoul,"" says Mr Panda, something that might spark a broader escalation in fighting.

Playbook move for leverage

Others say war fears should also be put in the context of Kim's operating patterns.

""Looking at the history of North Korea, it has often used provocation to attract the attention of other countries when it wants to negotiate,"" says Seong-Hyon Lee.

The regime continues to suffer from economic sanctions and 2024 is an election year for its enemies - with the US presidential vote and South Korean legislature poll.

""This presents a good opportunity for Kim Jong Un to provoke,"" explains Dr Lee.

The current US administration under President Joe Biden - tied up with Ukraine and Gaza - hasn't paid North Korea much heed and Pyongyang has also typically had most engagement with Republican administrations.

Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump famously had a bromance in 2019 before the denuclearisation talks soured - and the North Korean leader may be waiting for the former US president to return to the White House, where he might weaken the alliance with South Korea and be open to dialogue again.

North Korea's closer friendship with Russia and continued economic support from China in the past year may have also boosted its audacity, analysts suggest. It's received technical help from Russia to achieve a long-term goal of launching its spy satellites and the two states had several high-profile meetings including a leaders summit last year.

Reuters

Kim travelled to Russia's leading space facility last November after which his regime was able to launch their satellite

""Much of what we're seeing is a result of broader North Korean confidence in its own capabilities and its geopolitical position given Russian, and to a lesser degree, Chinese support,"" says Mr Panda.

Domestic goals

And others say Kim Jong Un's behaviour is all aimed at stabilising his own regime.

""This appears to be an ideological adjustment for regime survival,"" argues Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul. ""North Koreans are increasingly aware of their Communist country's failings compared to the South.""

He suggests a policy focused on defining the enemy is intended to justify Mr Kim's missile spending during a difficult time. There are reports of starvation across the country.

Presenting the South as the enemy also makes it easier to resolve ""cognitive dissonance at the heart"" of the North's view on South Korea, points out Mr Ward.

""Previously it was an indelibly evil state that was supposed to be the object of unification with a hopelessly corrupting culture that should not be consumed under any circumstances but with people who need to be liberated from their evil government,"" says Mr Ward.

""Now the country and its culture can just be branded evil and that justifies the continued crackdown on South Korean culture.""

""He doesn't actually want a war - a huge gamble where he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose"", says Sokeel Park, from Liberty in North Korea, an NGO helping North Korean refugees.

His threats are instead aimed at cementing his new North and South policy, designed ultimately to shore up his power at home, he says.

While it's important for South Korea, the US and allies to prepare for the worst-case scenario, it is also worth a thorough examination of the internal situation in North Korea and the wider geopolitics, analysts say.

At the end of the day, the best way to find out what the North's leader is thinking is to engage with him, argues Dr Lee.

""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats. It is seen as a necessary means to achieve a goal,"" he says.

""If necessary, one should consider meeting with the leader of an enemy nation to reduce misjudgements and prevent war.""","Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea's leader actually considering war?
Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said.
Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles.
Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature.
""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats."

Gerwig (left) and Robbie, pictured at the Golden Globes, missed out on best director and best actress respectively

Box office smash Barbie has received eight Oscar nominations - but its star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig were snubbed in some major categories.

Gerwig missed out on being recognised in best director, but a nomination for Anatomy of a Fall's Justine Triet meant the line-up was not entirely male.

This is also the first year women have directed three best picture nominees.

Oppenheimer scored the most nominations overall, followed by Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon.

There were nods for Barbie's star and director elsewhere - Robbie was recognised as a producer in the best picture line-up, while Gerwig was nominated for best adapted screenplay.

Barbie's best picture nod also means Gerwig is the first woman to direct three films which have been nominated for the top prize, following Lady Bird and Little Women.

However, as Barbie was the highest-grossing film of 2023, taking $1.44bn (£1.14bn) worldwide, many expected Gerwig and Robbie to show up in the best director and best actress categories.

Barbie's America Ferrera, who was seen as an outside bet, scored a nomination for best supporting actress

While Robbie missed out on a best actress nod, her co-star America Ferrera scored a surprise supporting actress nomination.

Fellow Barbie star Ryan Gosling was nominated for best supporting actor, while a track he performs in the film, I'm Just Ken, was nominated for best original song.

It will face competition from another song from the same film - What Was I Made For? by Billie Eilish. Barbie's other nominations are for production design and costume design.

But it was Oppenheimer that led the field with 13 nominations. Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic about theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer was both acclaimed by critics and a huge success at the box office.

Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr were nominated for acting prizes, and Nolan for best director.

Oppenheimer's Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr were all nominated for acting prizes

Poor Things, about an infant whose brain has been transplanted into the body of a grown woman, was the second most nominated film, with 11 nods.

The film's star, Emma Stone, said the nominations felt like a ""surreal dream"", adding she was ""beyond grateful"" to the Academy.

Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, about the murder of members of the Osage Indian tribe by white settlers who are after their oil, scored 10 nominations.

Maestro, a biopic about the composer Leonard Bernstein starring Bradley Cooper, received seven nominations.

Jimmy Kimmel will host the Oscars ceremony from Los Angeles on 10 March.

The top nominees:

13 nominations - Oppenheimer

11 - Poor Things

10 - Killers of the Flower Moon

8 - Barbie

7 - Maestro

5 - American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers, The Zone of Interest

Watch: Which films are the favourites for the Oscars?

For the first time in Oscar history, three of the best picture nominees were directed by women: Past Lives (directed by Celine Song), Barbie (Gerwig) and Anatomy of a Fall (Triet).

This is partly because the best picture category has been expanded in recent years, and there are now 10 slots available every year.

In a statement, Song said: ""Thank you so much to the Academy for this tremendous recognition - it's such an unbelievable honour. I am overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude. And for my first film... crazy.""

In a video posted on social media, Triet was seen celebrating and becoming emotional as she found out about her nominations.

The nominations also saw Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone become the first ever Native American actress to be recognised, while Jodie Foster received her first nomination in nearly three decades for Nyad.

Following two Golden Globe wins, Anatomy of a Fall scored five Oscar nominations (director Justine Triet pictured)

Her co-star Robert De Niro broke the record of longest time between first and most recent Oscar nominations - 49 years - overtaking Katharine Hepburn's previous record of 48.

A best international feature nomination for The Zone of Interest, which follows a German family who live next to the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, marks the UK's first appearance in the category in 24 years.

Half of this year's acting nominees are nominated for the first time.

Scorsese secured his 10th nod for Killers of the Flower Moon, a record for a living director. But he has only won the award once, for 2007's The Departed.

Meanwhile, 91-year-old composer John Williams achieved his 54th nomination for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. He is the second most-nominated person in Oscar history after Walt Disney, but has said the film will be his last major work.

Snubs and surprises

Lily Gladstone became the first Native American actress to be nominated, but co-star Leonardo DiCaprio missed out

In the leading actress category, there was recognition for Nyad star Annette Bening - whose nomination had been seen as an outside bet.

America Ferrera's surprise supporting actress nomination for Barbie suggests her monologue in the film about what it means to be a woman clearly connected with Academy voters.

But May December struggled - receiving one nomination for original screenplay but missing out on acting nominations for its stars Julianne Moore, Charles Melton and Natalie Portman.

And there were no nominations whatsoever for All of Us Strangers or Saltburn, despite their strong performance at the Bafta nominations last week.

Far less surprising, but still notable, were Leonardo DiCaprio's absence from best actor for his role in Killers of the Flower Moon, and Poor Things star Willem DaFoe's miss in best supporting actor.","Oscars 2024: Barbie's Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie miss key nominationsBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporterGetty ImagesGerwig (left) and Robbie, pictured at the Golden Globes, missed out on best director and best actress respectivelyBox office smash Barbie has received eight Oscar nominations - but its star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig were snubbed in some major categories.

By Kayla Epstein In Manchester, New Hampshire

BBC

Miranda Blair

Miranda Blair didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016 because he scared her.

This week, she was wearing a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat as she waited in sub-freezing temperatures to hear him speak in Manchester, New Hampshire, as he rallied Republican voters to choose him as their nominee.

A lot happened in between to change Ms Blair's thinking.

""Just a few years ago under Donald Trump, I felt like I could afford groceries and bring my girls skiing, and do all the things we wanted to do,"" she said.

The 40-year-old sales manager voted for Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2008 and found Mr Trump's lack of political experience disqualifying in 2016. Disliking the options, she didn't vote that year.

But during Mr Trump's presidency, she changed her views. And her financial struggles now, under a Joe Biden presidency, have cemented her support for Mr Trump.

""I'm a single mom of two young girls, and so life is really difficult right now, as far as the economy goes,"" she said. Despite earning more money than ever, she feels she will never be able to buy a home and has never paid so much in rent.

Ms Blair's evolution towards Mr Trump, spurred by the soaring cost of living in recent years, US involvement in new foreign conflicts and a belief that the Biden government has abandoned people like her, helps explain why the former president looks near certain to win the Republican presidential nomination.

In New Hampshire, the second state to choose its nominee, Mr Trump has opened a double-digit lead over former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and his other big rival, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, has dropped out.

In interviews across the state before voting began on Tuesday, at campaign headquarters and pubs and diners, Mr Trump's supporters said returning him to the White House was, as Ms Blair put it, ""our last shot at restoring our beautiful country"".

Reuters

Mr Trump is doing everything he can to nurture that sentiment.

""The Washington swamp has done everything in its power to take away your voice,"" he told supporters in Manchester on Saturday, while Ms Blair listened from the crowd. ""But this Tuesday it is finally going to turn your way, your voice is going to be given back. You had a voice just three years ago.""

The White House has for months made President Biden's economic record a key part of his re-election pitch. They argue his investments in infrastructure and green energy policies have boosted job creation and wages, and helped the economy weather the high inflation that dogged much of his first term.

But even though gas prices and inflation have now come down, voters like Ms Blair look back on the Trump presidency as a rosier time.

Chris Ager, the state committee chair of the New Hampshire Republicans, said Trump supporters were drawing a stark contrast between how they felt during his presidency, and how they feel now. ""He's essentially saying, 'Were you better off now than you were four years ago? Data says most people say no, we're not better.""

Rene Cote, who recently became a US citizen, said Mr Trump was a better choice than Mr Biden because of ""the economy, fuel [prices] - everything you can imagine was better than it is today"".

His son-in-law, John Ratliffe, believed that Mr Trump, who has taken a hardline stance on immigration issues since day one, would do a better job securing the southern border with Mexico. ""People are just sick of what's going on,"" he said. ""Something needs to be done and he's the only one who has the gall to do it.""

Getty Images

Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman, said volunteers were happy to brave frigid temperatures because ""suffering through the cold for a few short days to knock doors is much better than suffering through four more years of Joe Biden's disastrous presidency"".

Mr Trump's policies and persona have not fundamentally changed since his first campaign, to the extent Mr Ager referred to the strategy in New Hampshire as ""2016, 2.0"".

But Mr Trump's political message has changed after four years in the White House, which ended with him falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and a riot by his supporters at the Capitol.

He has drawn his supporters closer in 2024 with allegations of a vast legal and political conspiracy against him.

For many of his supporters in New Hampshire, this worldview has become fact, and their distrust in the US government has grown.

Just over half of the state's Republican voters believe that Mr Biden won the 2020 election ""due to voter fraud"", a Washington Post/Monmouth University poll released on Monday found. About 82% of voters who say they will vote for Mr Trump hold this view.

Ms Blair is one of them. She does not trust the vote-by-mail system and when asked about the false claims around the 2020 election said Mr Biden was not charismatic enough to have won a record-setting 81.2 million votes.

On Sunday, dozens of supporters gathered at Tempesta's, a pub in rural Keene modelled on a grand Dublin bar, to hear Congressman Matt Gaetz, a key Trump ally, make his pitch for the former president.

After his speech, he fielded a question from one man about the January 6 ""hostages"" - how Mr Trump has started referring to the individuals who were jailed, convicted, or pleaded guilty for their participation in the Capitol riot.

More on the US election

Lynne Mason, 60, said she didn't believe that the storming of the US Capitol three years ago was violent.

Her top concern was about illegal immigration but she also worried that high housing costs were putting her children off having families, and she was baffled by her $300 grocery bills.

Over and over, conversations with voters at the events turned back to the economy.

BethAnne Tatro, also at the Keene meet-and-greet, said that the cost of running her Monadnock Country Café had skyrocketed in the past couple of years. Sales were down and costs were up, she said, adding: ""Inflation was terrible.""

""I wanted to move my small business forwards,"" the 53-year-old said. ""In 2023, it went backwards.""

Getty Images

Ms Tatro did not point to a specific policy that Mr Trump should introduce in order to ease inflation or bring prices down. But she believed if he returned to the White House, people would simply feel more confident about their prospects. ""We'll see things adjust themselves.""

A Trump victory is looking very likely here, but not guaranteed. Ms Haley has been blazing through the state trying to court moderate Republicans and independent voters.

The state's large share of unaffiliated voters - those who chose not to register with a political party - are free to vote in the Republican primary and are currently up for grabs.

One activist group, Primary Pivot, is trying to convince unaffiliated voters who lean left to vote in the Republican primary because, as co-founder Robert Schwartz put it, ""Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and to our country… and we're all better off if both major parties have candidates that respect our democracy.""

Ms Haley has gained ground in the polls, and with that the confidence to attack Mr Trump more directly than before. After he appeared to confuse her with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms Haley, 52, questioned whether the 77-year-old was ""mentally fit"" for the pressures of the presidency.

Getty Images

On Sunday, she asked supporters: ""Do we really want to have two presidential candidates in their 80s?""

Elizabeth Smith, a 64-year-old who travelled from Ohio to volunteer for the Haley campaign, said that her candidate was the most qualified, given her experience in international affairs. ""And she doesn't have the chaos following her that President Trump always has following him.""

The primary is her last chance to turn things around in the race for the nomination, said Mr Ager, the New Hampshire Republican official.

But Ms Blair will be doing her part to ensure that doesn't happen.","Bills and border crisis drive Trump voters to pollsBy Kayla Epstein In Manchester, New HampshireBBCMiranda BlairMiranda Blair didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016 because he scared her.

By Jane Corbin BBC News

BBC

The Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.

Scientists have listed reasons for keeping its hands the closest they have ever been to ""Doomsday"" - but stopped short of nudging it further forward.

The threat of a new nuclear arms race, the Ukraine war and climate change concerns were all factors, they said.

The clock is set annually by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Since 2007, members have considered the impact of new man-made risks such as AI and climate change, as well as the greatest threat - nuclear war.

In its 2024 announcement on Tuesday, the Bulletin said that China, Russia and the US were all spending huge sums to ""expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals"" - which added to the ""ever-present danger of nuclear war through mistake or miscalculation"".

The war in Ukraine had also created an ""ever-present risk of nuclear escalation"", it said.

A lack of action on climate change and risks linked to ""misusing"" emerging biological technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were also cited.

The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow US scientists who had developed the atomic bomb.

They had seen its devastating effects two years earlier, at the end of World War Two, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They wanted to warn the public and put pressure on world leaders to make sure nuclear weapons were never used again.

The hands of the clock have moved 25 times. In 1947, they started at seven minutes to midnight. At the end of the Cold War, in 1991, they had fallen back to 17 minutes to midnight.

Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told the BBC that ""every major country, including the UK, is investing in their nuclear arsenal as if nuclear weapons are usable for a very long time. This is a very dangerous time… leaders are not acting responsibly.""

With the Doomsday Clock the closest it's ever been to midnight, Jane Corbin investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe and the breakdown of systems of constraint.

Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear weapons expert who has been involved in setting the Doomsday Clock for many years, says he was shocked when President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on alert after the invasion of Ukraine.

The world reacted with horror to the Russian leader's threat but it seems he had made a deliberate calculation.

""This is exactly what nuclear weapons are there for - to make certain you have a certain freedom of action,"" Podvig says. ""The Russian President believed that by making these statements he could deter the West from intervening in Ukraine which was a correct calculation - this is how deterrence works.""

Despite decades of arms control agreements there are still about 13,000 nuclear warheads globally, 90% of them Russian and American. Six other countries are declared nuclear powers: the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is widely believed to have these weapons, but has never confirmed it. Most modern nuclear weapons are many times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

In 2021, the UK increased the cap on its warheads from 225 to 260, potentially 35 more warheads, and the country's nuclear force is on high alert. Since the war in Ukraine began, there has been rhetoric from senior Russian figures suggesting Moscow's nuclear weapons could be used against the UK.

The UK's nuclear deterrent is housed in the west of Scotland at the Faslane base, home to four Vanguard submarines that carry Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads.

Getty Images

HMS Vigilant, one of the UK's Vanguard submarines, stationed at Faslane

Feargal Dalton, a former Lt Cdr who served on board submarine HMS Victorious, is one of a handful of people who have actually fired a Trident missile: a test missile with a dummy warhead.

""There's always one [submarine] somewhere out there, at 15 minutes notice to fire,"" Dalton says. ""As we speak there is a nuclear deterrent out there. The Vladimir Putins of the world know it's out there, it's credible and we could use it if needs be.""

Ever since the atomic bomb was created there has been opposition to these weapons. In the 1980s, the women of the Greenham Common peace camp fought to get all US nuclear missiles removed from UK soil - the last warheads left in 2008.

CND protesters at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk

However, at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is now protesting against the possibility of US weapons returning.

Pentagon documents - first reported by the Federation of American Scientists - suggest US ""special"" weapons will be stationed at the base. US fighter planes that are capable of dropping such weapons arrived at Lakenheath in 2021 and there are now plans by the United States Air Force to build dormitories for troops to serve in a potential nuclear mission on this site.

""We know that we have got public opinion on our side,"" Sophie Bolt from CND explains - as her small group chant slogans over the perimeter fence of the base. ""Nearly 60% of the population do not want to have nuclear bombs sited in Britain.""

Getty Images

RAF Lakenheath is home to the US Air Force's 48th Fighter Wing

""We've got nothing to do with this base, it is totally under US control,"" Alan Wright, another protestor says. ""If we get Trump in [the White House] next time and he may press the button because he's got a bigger button than Putin - then we are a target.""

However, Donald Trump has previously said he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being elected, although he hasn't explained how. Some analysts believe it is likely that US support for Ukraine could be diminished.

In the past decade, fears of a nuclear war have also been ramped up by Kim Jong-Un, leader of North Korea, the latest nation to join the nuclear club. He has boasted of testing nuclear-capable missiles that could reach the United States.

Former Bulletin of Atomic Scientists member and Doomsday Clock adviser, Sig Hecker, has visited North Korea's nuclear facilities seven times as part of a scientific research programme and estimates it could have 50 to 60 nuclear warheads by now.","Doomsday Clock stays at 90 seconds to midnightBy Jane Corbin BBC NewsBBCThe Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.

By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington

Getty Images

Mexico claims that as many over 500,000 US guns are trafficked into Mexico each year.

A US appeals court has ruled that a $10bn lawsuit filed by Mexico against US gun manufacturers can go ahead, reviving a long-running legal battle.

Mexico's government argues that the ""flood"" of illegal guns across the border is a result of ""deliberate"" business practices by the US gunmakers.

A lower court had dismissed the case in late 2022, prompting an appeal from the Mexican government.

The gun industry's trade association has denied any wrongdoing.

Among the companies named in the lawsuit are Smith & Wesson, Glock, Beretta, Barrett, Sturm and Ruger.

Mexican authorities allege that tens of thousands of US-manufactured guns are trafficked south across the border each year, providing drug cartels with easy access to massive arsenals used to fight each other and the Mexican government. Some estimates put the total at over half a million weapons each year.

More than 30,000 people were murdered last year in Mexico, which has extremely restrictive gun laws. The country is home to only one gun shop, housed in a Mexico City military complex.

The lawsuit, which was first filed in 2021 in a federal courthouse in Massachusetts - where several of the companies are based - argued that the manufacturers knew that guns were being sold to traffickers fuelling violence in the country.

But in 2022 a US federal judge dismissed the case on the grounds that the gun manufacturers were protected by a 2005 law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The law, also known as the PLCAA, shields gunmakers from damages ""resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse"" of their products.

Mexico's government swiftly appealed, arguing that the law only applies to injuries that take place in the US and does not protect the defendants - which include seven manufacturers and one distributor - from liability.

On Monday, a US appeals court ruled that the Mexican lawsuit ""plausibly alleges a type of claim that is statutorily exempt"" from the PCLAA, which only covers lawful gun sales.

Mexican and gun control advocates in the US quickly claimed the ruling as a victory, with Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Bárcena calling it ""great news"" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

In a statement, Jon Lowy, the president of Global Action on Gun Violence - who serves as Mexico's co-counsel on the case - said that the ruling is a ""huge step forward in holding the gun industry accountable for its contribution to gun violence, and in stopping the flood of trafficked guns to the cartels.""

""Not only did the Court recognize the right of another country to sue U.S. gun companies, it also pierced the unfair legal shield that gun companies have been hiding behind since 2005,"" he added.

Israeli soldiers carry the casket at the funeral of one reservist killed in Monday's attack

The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.

That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.

The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion.

""A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire,"" a spokesman said.

""The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it,"" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added.

According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day.

In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border.

They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October.

The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem.

Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags.

Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday.

The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had ""absolute victory.""

There has been fierce fighting in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which is crowded with displaced people.

Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people.

The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas.

Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held.

According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons.

The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city.

They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.

The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery.

It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff.

Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack.

According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October.","Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one dayBy Yolande Knell BBC News, JerusalemReutersIsraeli soldiers carry the casket at the funeral of one reservist killed in Monday's attackThe Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.

A gunman suspected of killing eight people in the city of Joliet, Illinois, has died after a confrontation with law enforcement officials, police say.

Police in Joliet said Romeo Nance, 23, is believed to have fatally shot himself after the confrontation near Natalia, Texas.

He is suspected of killing eight people at multiple locations in Joliet.

Seven of the victims were found in two nearby houses by police on Monday. The eighth was found earlier on Sunday.

The identities of the seven victims discovered on Monday have not yet been released.

The discovery of the bodies sparked a manhunt for the suspect, who authorities warned ""should be regarded as armed and dangerous"".

In a statement, Joliet police department said Mr Nance had been located by US Marshals near Natalia at approximately 20:30 local time on Monday (2:30 GMT on Tuesday).

At that point, it said, ""it is believed that Nance took his own life with a handgun following a confrontation with Texas law enforcement officials.""

It added: ""Identification of the victims and manner of death will be determined by the Will County Coroner's Office. This remains an active investigation.""

Natalia - which is just outside San Antonio is more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from Joliet by road. Driving between the two locations would take at least 18 hours.

It remains unclear why he travelled to Texas or whether he has any connections there.

Earlier, Joliet police chief Bill Evans told a news briefing that police were notified at 12:04 local time on Monday that several people had been found shot dead.

After arriving at the scene on West Acres Road, officers discovered seven bodies. Five were found in one house, and two in the other, Will County Sheriff's deputy chief Dan Jungles said. It is believed they were all part of the same family.

The motive for the attack was not immediately clear, but the suspect is believed to have known the victims.

""I've been a policeman 25 years. This is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Mr Jungles said.

Before Mr Nance was located in Texas, investigators said they believed he was driving a red Toyota Camry and had urged anyone with information about the attack, 40 miles (64km) south-west of Chicago, to contact them.

Separately, authorities said they had been notified of two shootings a day earlier at different locations in Joliet.

They said a car with the same number plate as the one linked to the discovery of the seven bodies on Monday was spotted in both locations.

One of the shootings resulted in the death of a 28-year-old man, who was shot in the head, authorities said.

He was identified by police as Toyosi Bakare, who was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the US for the past three years.

Police do not believe that Mr Bakare was related to any of the other victims, but was connected to Mr Nance.

Police said a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg at a separate location earlier that day, resulting in non-life threatening injuries.","Illinois mass shooting suspect dies in Texas - policeBy Jaroslav Lukiv BBC NewsCBS NewsA gunman suspected of killing eight people in the city of Joliet, Illinois, has died after a confrontation with law enforcement officials, police say.

On 24 January 1984, the Apple Macintosh 128K personal computer was unveiled to the world, but 40 years later it still has a loyal following of fans – and users.

David Blatner still has practically every Macintosh computer he ever bought. But one in particular stands out – the first. He remembers the neat way the screen was laid out; the glossy manual; the cassette tape tutorials explaining how to use the machine. It was everything he felt a computer should be.

He had seen early iterations of personal computers as a young child. He used to ride his bicycle to Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in California where his stepfather worked in the 1970s. There, Blatner got to try early personal computers such as the Alto, which had a graphical interface and a mouse.

""A computer that would work for a single person – that was, in itself, mind-boggling,"" remembers Blatner, who is now president of CreativePro Network, an online resource for creative professionals.

But it would take another decade before he got one of his own – with the arrival of the Apple Macintosh.

On 24 January 1984, a man called Steve Jobs got up on a stage and heaved a beige box out of a carrying case, shoved a floppy disc into it, and stood back. As the theme from Chariots of Fire played, the word ""Macintosh"" swept across the tiny computer's screen and a series of monochromatic images flashed up. The captivated audience – of Apple shareholders – went wild.

By today's standards, the tiny screen, boxy form and rudimentary graphics of the original Macintosh look ludicrous. The device was not even the first personal computer. But it was, arguably, the first to change the world. And Steve Jobs’ flashy launch day presentation, at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, became a template for his many later appearances introducing subsequent Apple hardware – including the iMac and iPhone.

Today, the Mac 128K – so called because it came with 128kb of Random Access Memory, or RAM – is a museum piece. Apple stopped producing the computers in October 1985 and discontinued software support for them in 1998. But a handful of diehard fans still use their Mac 128K computers today – although not without frustrations. The machines are extremely limited due to their small amount of memory. If you want to check out the 128K's specifications, Apple actually lists them on its website.

Even with its diminutive memory, no modem or ability to connect to the internet, and rudimentary graphics, there is a community of avid fans who delight in poring over this seemingly ancient hardware. David Greelish, a computer historian in Florida who is releasing a documentary about the 128Ks predecessor the Apple Lisa this month, notes the ingenuity of the 128K's original circuit board. ""It's got everything: ROM, RAM, processor and all the input-output,"" he says. ""Everything there in a beautiful little integrated square board. For 1984, it was amazing.""

The original Macintosh can still sell for as much as a modern computer. And for collectors they are a piece of computing history, with the signatures of the team who built it moulded into the plastic of the rear casing.

Some Mac 128K owners, however, use the devices to play quirky games like Frogger or Lode Runner on their treasured machines. All in black and white. The first Macintosh with a colour screen, the Macintosh II, only arrived in 1987.

The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England, is one of many collections that feature a functioning 128K. ""It’s 40 years old and it’s still going,"" says Lisa McGerty, chief executive, who remembers the introduction of Macintosh computers as a ""massive"" improvement for people in the printing and publishing business. Apple's graphical printer, the ImageWriter, was released shortly before the 128K.

McGerty’s colleague Adrian Page-Mitchell, collections officer, says it’s not always easy to keep these decrepit Macintoshes functioning. An earlier 128K that had been on display for a long time at the Centre for Computing History eventually failed and ""couldn't be fixed"", he says.

Sometimes Macs show their age in strange ways. Steven Matarazzo, a YouTuber and computer collector, says that one of the machine’s capacitors can sometimes degrade over time, meaning that the 128K's screen won’t work properly – it'll appear slightly squished.

Last year, he published a YouTube video about an apparent prototype version of the 128K that turned up. It wasn't working so its owner asked Matarazzo if he could take a look at it. Before long, Matarazzo had the device functioning again. He studied every inch of this early Mac in detail, enthusing about tiny differences between it and the version that made it to market – such as the little Apple logos imprinted on the rubber feet of the prototype. Those weren’t there in the final design. It’s a bit like archaeology for gadgets, he explains.

""You try and put this together – what was the process here, how early was this, how late was this?"" he says. ""That is, especially to me, what is really cool.""

The Apple II and the Apple Lisa, which predated the 128K, were also intended as intuitive, highly capable devices. But each had their own flaws or limitations – the Apple II did not come with a graphical user interface or mouse and the Lisa was much less affordable compared to the 128K, for instance.

Funnily enough, the era of individualised computing heralded by the original Macintosh is, in one sense, coming to an end

By the time the 128K launched, Blatner was finishing high school and looking for a computer to take to college – something as capable as those machines he'd seen at Xerox years before. His parents took him shopping and they soon found a 128K on display at a shop in downtown Palo Alto.

""It had menus, it had folders, it had a graphical user interface, it had a mouse – it was everything I thought a computer ought to be,"" he recalls, adding that he still has the receipt. The device cost his parents $2,495 and, at college, Blatner was soon showing it off to his fellow students. They used to queue up behind him in his dorm for a chance to try the computer out. ""I have a file cabinet with all these crazy things we were printing out at college,"" he says. ""People just loved it.""

It was no coincidence that this technology echoed Blatner’s earlier experiences with computers at Xerox. Jef Raskin, who initiated the Macintosh project – and named the computer after his favourite variety of apple – had also seen the same Xerox technology and been inspired by it. Not only that, in December 1979, Jobs and a handful of Apple engineers toured Xerox multiple times. This gave them ideas that would later shape both the Lisa and Macintosh. In exchange for those impactful demonstrations, Xerox received a large volume of Apple shares, which they quickly sold, losing out on potentially billions of dollars had they held onto them.

Famously, Jobs ended up taking over the Macintosh project started by Raskin after getting kicked off the Lisa team. By this point, Jobs had developed a vision for an affordable personal computer and he decided that the Macintosh would help him make it a reality.

Among the things that made Macintosh different was its presentation. It wasn't just a personal computer, it was a computer with personality. Susan Kare, a graphic designer, came up with cartoon-like icons that practically anyone could understand, and she also contributed to the Macintosh’s collection of digital fonts.

But so much about the Mac and the splash that it made was fuelled by marketing and hype. Jason Scott, a filmmaker and historian of technology who works at the digital archive non-profit Internet Archive, remembers seeing the original TV ad for the Mac 128K as a teenager. The bizarre short film was directed by Ridley Scott and depicted a dystopian future inspired by the novel 1984. What would save us all from that dark future? The Mac 128K, of course.

""That commercial began playing and it seemed like it was completely from Mars,"" recalls Scott. ""Something was going on but I didn't quite understand it.""

Not long after, when Scott tried a Macintosh for the first time, he was enraptured. It was, he says, like looking through a telescope to another world.

And yet the Mac was not as big a success as some expected. ""It didn’t sell to businesspeople like Steve thought it would,"" remembers Andy Cunningham, who worked on the marketing campaign for the device. ""It’s ultimately why Steve got fired from Apple."" Jobs left in 1985 but returned to the company in the late 1990s.

It took until 1988 before Apple had sold enough Macintosh devices, including various subsequent iterations of the original Macintosh, to finally eclipse sales of the Apple II, which had come out way back in 1977.

But Macs did appeal to many, especially young people and those working in creative roles.

Cunningham and her colleague Jane Anderson helped to pump up hype over the original Macintosh by offering individual journalists six hours each with people at Apple, including Jobs, and giving them multiple demonstrations of the machine to ensure that they understood what they were writing about. ""I watched them all play with this computer and their eyes just glistened,"" says Cunningham.

It would be wrong to suggest that the Mac 128K was a perfect computer. As mentioned, it had severe limitations and was hardly a commercial hit at first. But it left an indelible mark. The rise of personal computing was undoubtedly a watershed moment. The ridiculously oversized, cabinet-like computers that you could only plug into via a clunky terminal now seemed hopelessly antiquated. Now we had portable, cheerful, accessible machines that almost anyone could use.

Funnily enough, the era of individualised computing heralded by the original Macintosh is, in one sense, coming to an end. In the 21st Century, we are becoming ever more dependent on server farms, cloud processing, big data, and networked systems. Other people’s computers are increasingly indispensable for running our own.

""We are now on the other side,"" reflects Blatner, who has kept almost every Macintosh he ever bought. ""We did need this 40-year period of enabling people, of empowering people.""

Francine Katsoudas, EVP and chief people, policy and purpose officer at Cisco, enters the BBC's Executive Lounge to talk about how technology can foster equality, safety and innovation.

Every day at Cisco, Francine Katsoudas is laser focused on one mission: bridging the gap between people who can access and use digital technology effectively and those who can't. She calls it the ""digital divide"" – and says it's never been so important.

""Digitisation can change people's lives,"" Katsoudas, Cisco's EVP and chief people, policy and purpose officer, tells the BBC. ""Our mission statement and end goal is to power an inclusive future for all.""

In 2023, the California-based multinational digital-networking and cybersecurity company surpassed its goal of positively impacting one billion lives through its social grants and Networking Academy programmes. Yet Katsoudas feels there's more work to be done.

She's leading Cisco's Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) programme, which partners with business and government leaders to steer national digital agendas as well as support local communities through tailored ethical, innovative technology solutions. This could mean establishing widespread internet access, or streamlining complex processes to expedite medical diagnoses and treatment.

Katsoudas sees potential for the programme to impact more countries and fields, especially as governments increasingly acknowledge the need to grow tech around education, critical infrastructure, sustainability and more. ""These projects often start with countries recognising that digital capabilities will, in many cases, make life better for them and their citizens,"" she says.

She shares her evolving concept of digital inclusion with the BBC, outlines her roadmap for leaders and offers her perspective on the opportunities and challenges in 2024.

Executive Lounge The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here.

How do you define ""digital inclusion""?

The definition of digital inclusion evolves as technology advances. But essentially, it's about ensuring everyone has the same ability to digitally access and use essential everyday amenities, such as education and healthcare services.

As technology moves forward, this definition will broaden but, in any service, the most important question to ask is, ""does everyone have the same ability to participate?"". Ultimately, when true digital inclusion exists, there are very few, if any, situations in which only a small proportion of the general population has access to services that make their lives easier, give them better quality care and so on.

There are many countries around the world – including the US – where 90% of people can digitally participate in all areas of modern life. On the African continent, this number is closer to 40%.

One challenge involved in achieving digital inclusion is the economics of getting on the internet. For instance, we do a lot of work with governments to help them figure out new financial models to make internet access easier.

What framework do you use to determine which areas the digital inclusion program will focus on?

We began our digital inclusion journey proactively, by looking at areas where we thought technology would have the biggest impact. Over the years, our approach has become more reactive. Countries and governments started coming to us with a 'problem statement', describing the issues they wanted to be addressed or the conditions they wanted to be improved.

An example of this is when a hospital in Norway presented us with a problem statement focused on the seven-week time lag from the point of a cancer diagnosis to the cancer patient starting treatment. For those people who have been through something as trying as a cancer diagnosis, this seven-week period is not only scary, but critical. Therefore, we created a CDA program where we brought the data together and connected all the parties, resulting in a reduction of the cancer treatment time from seven weeks to seven days.

What has been your biggest win in digital inclusion?

Given that people are at the heart of everything we do, the biggest successes we've had are when we focus on people and their skills.

For example, in South Africa, we've taken our Networking Academy training ­– the knowledge we've accumulated from a digital skills and cybersecurity perspective – to create a laboratory on the premises of a government office. In this lab, we offer cybersecurity training to government employees, based on our Networking Academy curriculum.

In this era, cybersecurity attacks are growing in number and sophistication, and, through programmes like this, we can help governments upskill their employees to protect against these attacks, protecting people's data and critical infrastructure such as energy grids and communications.

Additionally, based on fiscal 2021 global survey data of Networking Academy students taking Cisco certification-ready courses, such as CyberOps Associate and CCNA, 95% either secured a job or pursued further education opportunities, and 96% said the programme had a positive impact on their life.

If you were to create a digital inclusion roadmap for leaders, what checkpoints would be included?

Firstly, determine which area your business should focus on, and ascertain how your core business strengths can drive digital inclusion in that area.

Secondly, set a meaningful digital goal based on the impact you want your business to have. For example, with our Networking Academy, we set a goal for the number of students we wanted to educate.

Thirdly, create a no-obligation prototype or pilot to establish whether your goal is possible. In the case of our CDA, for instance, no commitment is needed from a country or government at the pilot stage. We simply outline a potential solution, which the country or government then advises if it meets their needs. If so, we then proceed to scale the solution very quickly.

Lastly, there are lots of great projects in the area of digital inclusion the world over, which we can all learn from. Take the time to understand what has worked and what hasn't, then apply these learnings to your digital inclusion project.

Cisco by the numbers 25% : Percentage of countries worldwide participating in Cisco's CDA programme 1,300+ : Completed or active digital inclusion projects launched in participating countries to narrow the digital divide across industries, citizens and residents 86% : Reduction in the timeframe from cancer diagnosis to treatment due to the adoption of Cisco's digital inclusion practices in Norwegian healthcare, one of Cisco's marquee initiatives

In terms of your specialty ­– people, policy and purpose – what opportunities and challenges do you see on the horizon in 2024?

Some of our biggest challenges this year will be the same challenges we've already faced – namely, how we focus on doing everything we can to maximise digital inclusion from a sustainability perspective, and how we can work with our customers and partners around the world to do the same.

Generative AI will be one of our focal points. Using AI, we can help people with their development plans, coaching and careers in ways that we couldn't possibly have done before. There is also the intersection of sustainability and AI, which will be another huge area of focus – and probably challenge – moving forward.

Ultimately, we recognise that a company's work around purpose is most impactful when tied to its core business, rather than when it's treated as a separate and distinct project. Therefore, the biggest goal and the biggest opportunity for us this year will be to ensure that purpose is embedded in every element of our business.","Every day at Cisco, Francine Katsoudas is laser focused on one mission: bridging the gap between people who can access and use digital technology effectively and those who can't.

The unearthing of an immense network of cities deep in the Ecuadorean Amazon is proving that the world's biggest rainforest was once a thriving cosmopolitan hub.

""Let me ask you something,"" said archaeologist Stéphen Rostain. ""What do you know about the history of the Amazon?""

I thought about it for a moment, and just as I opened my mouth to respond, Rostain let me in on a little secret: ""You know nothing, because the history that we think we know is wrong. It's a history made by so-called chroniclers that rarely saw what they described. It's a history of lies. We know a little bit from colonial times, but it's a story of exploitation of land, torture and slavery. It's not a beautiful history. But this, the discovery of a vast urban cradle lets us better understand the first actors of this history: the Indigenous people. It forces us to rethink the entire human past of the Amazon.""

The previous day, Rostain and his team had published the results of a study that was nearly 30 years in the making, and that sent shockwaves around the world.

Using airborne laser-scanning technology (Lidar), Rostain and his colleagues discovered a long-lost network of cities extending across 300sq km in the Ecuadorean Amazon, complete with plazas, ceremonial sites, drainage canals and roads that were built 2,500 years ago and had remained hidden for thousands of years. They also identified more than 6,000 rectangular earthen platforms believed to be homes and communal buildings in 15 urban centres surrounded by terraced agricultural fields.

Antoine Dorison and Stéphen Rostain

""It was really a lost valley of cities,"" said Rostain, the director of investigation at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France. ""It's incredible.""

According to Rostain, the most striking aspect of this urban cluster, which is located in eastern Ecuador's Upano Valley, is its astonishing road network. The cities' streets were engineered to be perfectly straight, connecting at right angles with one another and linking the different cities like a prehistoric highway. The largest were 10m wide, with one extending 25km. ""Given the hilly terrain, this road network was even more advanced than modern ones,"" Rostain said.

This forgotten network of cities is not only believed to be more than 1,000 years older than any other known complex Amazonian site, but its staggering size and level of sophistication suggests a highly structured society that appears to be even larger than the well-known Maya cities in Mexico and Central America.

According to Rostain and his team, beginning in roughly 500 BCE, the Kilamope and later Upano cultures begun building their homes on raised platforms that were organised around plazas. The size of this early city covers an area that's comparable to Egypt's pyramid-studded Giza Plateau. Dating suggests these societies thrived and expanded for roughly 1,000 years until the sites were mysteriously abandoned between 300 and 600 AD – a period roughly contemporaneous with Ancient Rome.

The cities are believed to have housed 30,000 people, or perhaps even more (Credit: Antoine Dorison and Stéphen Rostain)

While it's difficult to estimate how many people lived in these connected cities at any one time, archaeologist Antoine Dorison, who worked with Rostain on the Lidar findings and co-authored the paper, said that at its peak, it could have been home to as many as 30,000 people. Other estimates suggest the number could have been in the hundreds of thousands. If true, this would make it comparable with the estimated population of Roman-era London.

""This discovery has proven there was an equivalent of Rome in Amazonia,"" Rostain said. ""The people living in these societies weren't semi-nomadic people lost in the rainforest looking for food. They weren't the small tribes of the Amazon we know today. They were highly specialised people: earthmovers, engineers, farmers, fishermen, priests, chiefs or kings. It was a stratified society, a specialised society, so there is certainly something of Rome.""

And yet, were it not for two priests, the world would never have known about this long-lost ""Amazonian Rome"".

As Rostain explained, in the 1970s, a local priest named Juan Bottasso stumbled upon a strange-looking mound built atop a platform in the Upano Valley. Soon after, Bottasso was visited by another priest from Quito named Pedro Porras and Bottasso said to him, ""I want to show you something."" The two rode on horseback to the mound, and Porras, apparently curious about what he'd seen, organised a crude excavation of it and published his findings in an Ecuadorean paper. The site was then forgotten for roughly 15 years until Rostain, who had been excavating a Maya site in Guatemala in the 1980s, uncovered the priest's publication and set out for Ecuador.

With the help of an Ecuadorean colleague, Rostain began excavating the mounds in 1996. Two years later, his colleague abandoned the project (""Not everybody is in love with working in Amazonia,"" Rostain said), but Rostain continued hacking his way through the jungle for seven more years, uncovering roads, additional sites and what he thought were hundreds of mounds. ""It was different than anything I'd seen before,"" he said. ""In the Amazon, they don't build with stone, like in Maya or Inca territory. It was only earthen architecture.""

Rostain returned to live in Ecuador in 2011, and in 2015, Ecuador's National Institute for Cultural Heritage funded an aerial survey of the valley with Lidar, which has been transforming how archaeologists conduct research in jungles and revealing previously unknown evidence of Maya and other pre-Columbian societies. When Rostain and Dorison received the data in 2021 and began poring through it, Rostain realised he was completely wrong: ""There weren't hundreds of mounds, but at least 6,000 and probably many, many more.""

One of the most intriguing questions Rostain and his colleagues have been trying to understand is what led this society to engineer perfectly straight roads through the region's mountainous topography. ""Why would you build these straight roads five metres deep when you can easily walk through the hills?"" Rostain asked. ""I think they built them to imprint their identity, their relationship with the Earth in the earth. They are symbolic roads, like other roads in the Andes [notably the Inca's famed Qhapaq Ñan, which is still considered by many Inca descendants as a living road today].""

Rostain and his team have also identified several other features from the Upano cities that have survived what he calls the pre-Columbian world's ""catastrophic contact"" with the Spanish. The cities' orthogonal plot system of drained fields and terraces mirrors that which is still used by the Indigenous Cariña people of Venezuela. Analysis of starch grains from the many decorative and painted vessels found reveal that the area's earliest residents cultivated beans, manioc, sweet potatoes and maize, just as Indigenous residents in the area do today. In fact, the Upano Valley's highly fertile volcanic soil (which might have allowed these societies to thrive, and could have led to its sudden collapse if the nearby Sangay volcano erupted) still enable modern-day Indigenous farmers to harvest maize three times a year. And some micro-traces recovered at the sites are identical to those of modern-day chicha (fermented corn beer).

""I am deeply impressed by the profound wisdom of the Amazonian Indigenous people,"" said Carla Jaimes Betancourt, an archaeologist specialising in the Americas at the University of Bonn. ""Their remarkable understanding of their environment, coupled with their insightful practices for modifying the landscape, has created a unique biocultural legacy that endures to this day and is our duty to preserve. I believe that these cities will serve as examples, offering inspiration for the future through their harmonious integration with the natural world.""

Local attractions The Upano Valley is a growing eco-tourism destination. The town of Macas is a good place to base yourself for rafting, hiking and hot spring excursions. The nearby Sangay National Park is a Unesco World Heritage Site home to three volcanoes, dozens of lagoons and a stunning amount of biodiversity.

Like Machu Picchu and so many of the famed Maya sites, Rostain is confident that travellers will one day be able to experience the Upano Valley's cities for themselves, but as he said: ""You have to be patient. It's still very much a forgotten place with very few tourists."" Yet, when that day comes, he says visitors will be in for a treat.

""It's a beautiful landscape,"" he said. ""You have the [Upano] river that cuts like a knife in the ground and is 2km wide. There are 100m-tall vertical cliffs and forest and 30km away, you can see the towering Sangay volcano. I understand why the Upano people chose this place [then], and why they choose this place [today].""

For now, Rostain is simply happy to have given something back to Ecuador during this tough time in its modern history. ""I'm in love with Ecuador and I think such a discovery gives a little bit of pride to the Ecuadorean people,"" he said. ""For so long, they have suffered a little bit of comparison with Peru. Ecuador didn't have their Rome, and now I think they've got it.""

From Palm Springs to Paris, savvy home-owners are channelling mid-century retro in their own way. Vintage enthusiasts offer their tops tips.

The mid-century modern aesthetic certainly has staying power. It became a ""thing"" in the late-1990s, championed in the pages of that instant style bible, Wallpaper magazine. And nearly three decades on, it's still with us. But sourcing a piece of British-made G Plan furniture or a classic Eames chair has got harder and harder, as the pieces become ever-more collectible.

More like this:

In the meantime, the mid-century modern look has evolved, as Andrew Weaving notes in his new book Retro Revival. ""Living retro does not demand close adherence to any particular set of style rules,"" he writes. For him, it's more about dates: the 1950s to the 1970s to be precise. Home-owners who embrace that period can do so in their own way. ""Living retro is a multi-faceted look that ranges from sophisticated glamour to pared-down chic, allowing its followers to cherry-pick their favourite pieces from the cream of 20th-Century design.""

It's all about having the confidence to collect pieces that you really like, and then being clever about how you put them together

So instead of slavishly following strict design rules, Weaving thinks of it as an idiosyncratic style that's all about having the confidence to collect pieces that you really like, and then being clever about how you put them together. What makes them gel? ""It could be their material, shape or colour,"" he tells BBC Culture – it's just about them complementing each other.

This explains why the den in Weaving's London home has a contemporary desk by the ""godfather of minimalism"" John Pawson. Sleek and with a simple construction, it's paired with Robin Day's 1950s Festival Hall chair. In fact, the whole loft space (in a former dog biscuit factory) is an eclectic mix of 20th-Century design ""that is only united by its retro flavour"".

So on the shelves of the Comprehensive Storage System (CSS), designed by George Nelson for Herman Miller in 1959, there are timber pieces by the London-based sculptor Brian Willsher, who died in 2010. And the dining table was designed by Jasper Morrison in the 1990s, while Weaving picked up the big mirror on the sideboard at a car boot sale in London's Whitechapel 30 years ago. ""It was probably quite new when I bought it,"" says Weaving, but it worked for him as ""it has the scale of an office reception area"". The hand-painted silk wall-hanging by Tokyo-born artist Yumi Katayama in the kitchen was found on eBay. ""You've got to traipse through it, it's still a good source for things,"" he says of the auction site.

This approach doesn't just work in a London loft. From Palm Springs to Paris, savvy home-owners are channelling mid-century retro in their own way. David Jimenez's house in Palm Springs, Florida, embraces the Hollywood Regency style – with a twist. A product of the Hollywood golden age of the 1920s-1950s, this style is an updated take on the interiors of the 19th-Century Regency era, with a generous dose of the ornate glamour of film sets thrown in.

In Retro Revival, Jimenez explains how he drew inspiration from ""the chic homes in books by Slim Aarons and by the revival of Hollywood Regency by hip designers like Kelly Wearstler and Jonathan Adler"". They in turn, were inspired by the celebrated English designer David Hicks as well as the leading lights of US interior design history such as Dorothy Draper, Billy Baldwin and Billy Haines.

""In my mind I had a very romantic idea of what Palm Springs was all about,"" Jimenez tells BBC Culture, ""It was all very Rat Pack-esque, and I set out to create spaces that reflected a comfortable, retro sensibility without breaking the bank.""

Retro tips - Pair a mid-century chair with contemporary cushions or curtains in geometric patterns - If originals are hard to come by, reach for re-editions from classic brands like B&B Italia, Marimekko and Aram - Think local: neighbourhood selling sites can be a great source for unexpected mid-century finds - If you must replace original doors or tiles, try and stick to their original proportions

He scoured flea markets and local second-hand stores in order to pull this off. ""On weekends, I would hop in my convertible and slowly drive down East Palm Canyon Drive stopping at every antique shop that caught my eye. One vintage store in particular called Modern Way, scored me some funky period lamps but their brilliant citron yellow colour also became a source of inspiration."" Jimenez added other accessories in yellow to the mostly monochrome interiors.

The challenge of finding seating for such a large living room was solved when he unearthed a matching pair of tattered couches in a second-hand store. ""I paid $150 apiece, and had them made over in a refreshing shade of light-blue Naugahyde [artificial leather].""

In the master bedroom, he hung Raindrops by Curtis Jere, who fashioned handmade metal wall sculptures in the 1950s and 1960s. ""It was a huge score because I found the sculpture tucked under a table at the back of a vintage shop and got it for a song.""

The pinkish-orange terracotta tiles throughout the house needed revamping. ""Ripping them out seemed like a big expense, so instead I had them painted over with a bright white epoxy,"" he explains. And rather than replacing the original kitchen cabinets, ""I gave them a second life by over-dressing them with handsome wood trim, a coat of gleaming white paint and clear-glass knobs.""

With a bit of imagination, even the most contemporary piece can be given a vintage flavour

Weaving points out that sometimes it's the proportions of items that make it right for a mid-century house. ""Things like the size of tile and placement of appliances were well thought-out in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the US."" Beware of changing original cupboard doors, for example, as ""the sizes will be wrong and that makes a difference"".

Retro eclecticism

Meanwhile in Paris, stage- and set-designer Pascal Levy-Trumet has done a light-touch conversion to a former metal workshop. His aesthetic, his job and his foraging skills have led to a sort of retro eclecticism. In the living area, there are two white 1980s sofas by Antonio Citterio for Flexform, and a cluster of spherical glass lamps salvaged from a hair salon on the Champs-Elysées are suspended over the staircase. The anodised aluminium table and chairs would have graced a 1970s meeting room, and Levy-Trumet found the white, moulded plastic chair on a Paris street at 4am.

With a bit of imagination, even the most contemporary piece can be given a vintage flavour. Why not take an Ikea sideboard and make it retro by adding hairpin legs? ""That's an improvement on abusing an old teak sideboard by painting it to update it,"" Weaving says.

And of course, some standards of comfort and functionality have changed in the last half a century. If you're living somewhere full time, you might need a bed with a thicker mattress, for example. Mark Davis took this approach with his 1965 Palm Springs home. ""The entire house was floored in white 18-inch tiles, which we covered with cork for warmth,"" he says in Retro Revival. This worked for him, as he was out ""to create a home that might not be authentic in all the details but was a snapshot of how it could have looked when first built,"" Weaving writes.

That can be easier to pull off because so many manufacturers reissued their mid-century classics. From Sanderson's textiles, to Aram and B&B Italia, pieces may appear to be vintage but can be conveniently bought brand new.

But not all mid-century home-owners mix and match. Some, like Courtney and Joy Newman, are purists. As Weaving puts it in his book, perfectionists are those ""who seek to recreate a specific moment in time in their home, and to put together an interior that is entirely faithful to the building that houses it, so the whole interior conjures up one love, one era, one moment in architectural and design history"". The Newmans' 1969 house in Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs was untouched, and even had its original bathrooms – one orange and the other yellow.

The couple had direct access to authentic pieces through Courtney's store, Modern Way, which specialises in high-end vintage by the likes of Vladimir Kagan, Milo Baughman, Thayer Coggin, Sergio Rodrigues and Pierre Cardin. They even went to the trouble and expense of sourcing vintage kitchen appliances.

Weaving warns that turning design detective is time-consuming and can add extra cost. ""But whether you're going for the full-on period experience, or just want to capture a retro flavour, ultimately these efforts are worthwhile, as it's the amazing attention to detail that makes these homes work.""

Do you have TikTok voice? (Credit: Getty Images)

Creators on TikTok have developed a specific accent – would you recognise it if you heard it?

Before I switch on the ringlight, even before I've loaded my battery into my camera, I already know what I'm going to say. I press record, look at the lens, and deliver my script. In about seven minutes it's all done – a new video for TikTok. Afterwards, I think no more about the words that I've said, and certainly not the way I delivered them. At least, until now.

It turns out there may be a ""TikTok voice"". It apparently includes ""uptalk"" – a rising intonation on declarative sentences – and ""vocal fry"": a soft creak as you speak.

If you want to know what that sounds like, I explained in this video for TikTok:

What does Tiktok voice sound like?

So, if ""TikTok voice"" really is a thing, how did it emerge, and who tends to use it?

The phenomenon of ""influencer speak"" predates TikTok – linguistic quirks have emerged on YouTube or Instagram for well over a decade. But the app's low barrier to entry has created significantly more creators. And crucially, more of them are female than male.

In a media interview last month, Christopher Strelluf, an associate professor of linguistics at the University of Warwick, suggested that TikTok voice is particularly associated with young women – who are often linguistic innovators. ""The way young women use language is the future of the way language evolves. So any changes we hear by young women are probably the future of English,"" he told NationalWorld, a British news publisher.

Research has consistently found this to be the case; several studies have suggested men have historically lagged behind women by a whole generation when it comes to linguistic change.

Christian Ilbury, a lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, suggests that these speech patterns may have emerged because it allows creators to ""hold the conversational floor"".

In my experience as a TikTok creator, uptalk can sound more persuasive and personal. ""Sociolinguistic research shows that the speaker is using uptalk as a rhetorical device to keep you engaged in the discourse,"" says Ilbury. A low-pitched, declarative monotone, by contrast, would be flatter and less engaging. (This echoes a tip I once heard when I was training for radio broadcasting earlier in my career: I was advised to 'never sound like you're finishing a sentence'. The idea is that the listener is encouraged to stay tuned in.)

Are criticisms of TikTok voice gendered? (Credit: Getty Images)

Yet one of the curious elements of this style of speaking is that both uptalk and creaky voice are wildly vilified. Some people seem to associate uptalk with uncertainty or a lack of authority. And when I looked up a definition of vocal fry online, one of the first Google search results from a website called Voices told me ""vocal fry is demeaning, condescending and aloof. It's the perfect vocalisation for an unlikable character.""

Some commenters on the video I made for TikTok about it were also not fans. ""Vocal fry seems to be getting worse in the US for sure,"" said one. ""The rising intonation implies a question or ignorance,"" said another.

You may also like:

It's not quite true that vocal fry is getting more prevalent. A systematic review in 2020 actually found that ""widespread claims of its recent increase among young American women have not been empirically confirmed"".

""In the case of vocal fry, teenage girls in English-language speech communities might use vocal fry more than other groups of people,"" says Strelluf, but ""findings in academic research are mixed"".

There is the catch: women may be pioneering in a linguist's eyes, but research suggests they are more likely to be perceived negatively when using linguistic patterns like vocal fry or uptalk compared with men. In one small study, people rated female speakers with vocal fry as less attractive and intelligent than female speakers without it. They didn't distinguish between men who spoke with different ""fries"". Another study showed that vocal fry hurts women's career prospects. And a third found that women with vocal fry were perceived as more neurotic than those without.

It's definitely just prejudice, nothing to do with content. There is nothing wrong with the way young women's voices sound – Deborah Cameron

Strelluf says that once people decide a linguistic feature has a sociolinguistic feature – that uptalk sounds indecisive, for instance – they then start to notice it more. It is textbook confirmation bias.

Deborah Cameron, a linguist at the University of Oxford, says: ""It's definitely just prejudice, nothing to do with content. There is nothing wrong with the way young women's voices sound"".

In her upcoming book Language, Sexism and Misogyny, Cameron writes that criticisms of uptalk almost exclusively focus on women, and that this can have damaging consequences. ""Women can and do push back against this kind of criticism,"" she says, ""but for every woman who gives it 'zero priority', there will be others who internalise the message that the way they speak is a problem, and that by not addressing it they are 'holding themselves back'.""

Cameron ends her analysis of criticisms of uptalk and vocal fry by saying: ""This is the paradox at the heart of advice telling women to speak with confidence: the more women are told that the way they speak is holding them back, the less confident they will feel.""

Strelluf agrees that language judgements are usually personal. ""Our evaluations of language are almost always really evaluations of people,"" he says. ""For instance, we often say that French sounds 'romantic'. But there's nothing inherently romantic about French – half of French vowels are said in the nose, which should be decidedly unromantic.""

Getty Images

TikTok has developed its own language patterns in terms of word choice too (Credit: Getty Images)

Another way that TikTok is influencing language is through the choice of words people use. In his research, Ilbury describes the sorts of speech patterns we encounter on social video as ""digital style"", which has different mimetic subgenres. If you want to make a video about what you ate today, for example, an experienced TikTokker knows to say ""What I ate in a day"" right at the top of the video. If you want to talk about your family home's distinctively Mexican memorabilia, you know to start the video by saying: ""Things in my Mexican family home that just make sense.""

""In order for it to be recognised, there are stylistic and semiotic things you have to do, and if you think about TikTok videos as organised into meme genres, they have to have certain elements you recognise as belonging to that genre,"" Ilbury says. ""One of those things is language.""

So, TikTok creators are not only deploying linguistic features known for driving engagement; their words and intonations are building out entire meme genres too.

Discovering all this, I'm now aware that I might have developed a touch of TikTok voice myself. But if someone comments negatively about that on my own videos, I'll remember that it says a lot more about them than it does about me.

One of the main reasons keeping American drivers from going electric is that cars are too small. They want size and luxury – and auto companies are delivering.

Americans love their SUVs. Both industry experts and consumers say one of the top reasons US drivers haven't made the switch to EVs is the lack of comparable electric models.

Drivers want an EV SUV that matches the rich features of their gas guzzlers – size, performance and style – but the pickings are slim, says EY partner and American automotive eMobility leader Felipe Smolka. ""High initial costs and concerns about range have been major barriers, particularly when juxtaposed with well-established gasoline-powered SUVs, which offer reliability and a broad range of options,"" he says.

But this year, that will change. Auto companies are preparing dozens of all-electric SUVs for the US market, from luxurious three-row vehicles that can carry football teams to practice, to mini-SUVs with an affordable price tag. These new vehicles could tear down some of the major barriers to EV adoption like price, range and variety.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, newcomer VinFast, owned by Vietnam's largest conglomerate VinGroup, revealed more details about its mini VF3 SUV coming to the US market with a relatively tiny price to match – likely sub-$20,000 (£15,780) – which after rebate could make it one of the most affordable cars in the US. Tesla is also offering a smaller, more affordable offering in its Model Y – a compact SUV with a base price of $44,000 (£34,640).

Chinese auto company Nio, which set up shop in California's Silicon Valley last year, has plans to enter the US market by 2025 with a luxury six-seater SUV, Nio ES8. While its base price of around $70,000 (£55,150) puts it on the more expensive end of the spectrum, it includes luxury features, including massage seats, fast charge and integrated AI assistant, Nomi, that put it into a class with much pricier SUVs like Tesla's Model X.

China has an advantage in the EV market, where government subsidies and access to more than half the world's supply of lithium make it possible for the country to produce new models – including SUVs – at a lower price point.

Some American companies, however – particularly California-based EV makers including Rivian, Lucid Motors and Fisker – made the decision to prioritise all-electric SUVs over other models early on.

Henrik Fisker, CEO of the eponymous brand, says consumers are willing to test out these new companies to get the aesthetics they want. ""We have seen people coming from other car brands,"" he says. ""So, that means people like that we have a real awesome-looking SUV, because some of the new electric cars look more like hatchbacks.""

At CES, Fisker showcased its Ocean model, which includes seating for five. They also have a subcompact SUV announced for 2025 named Pear that starts at $29,900 (£23,558).

In addition to price and variety, the US market has made it clear that they want EVs with at least a 300-mile (483km) range. Car makers have heeded the call. Tesla's line-up includes its best-selling Model X, a luxury mid-size crossover SUV with a battery range of 326 miles. Many of the newer generation of electric SUVs have similarly long ranges including models from the Big Three automakers.

Many industry experts believe this consumer desire for ever greater battery range has more to do with short-term anxiety about lack of charging infrastructure, and less to do with a real need for such performance.

""Most consumers do not actually drive as much as they think they do,"" says Achyut Jajoo, senior vice president and general manager of manufacturing and automotive at Salesforce. ""You do not really need 300 miles of range on a daily basis. What you need is maybe 50 or 70 miles of range."" He explains that as the public charging infrastructure is built out, the demand for long-range EV SUVs may taper off. For now, however, range is a critical selling point.","The EV SUVs consumers want are comingBy Martine Paris Features correspondentCourtesy of ChevroletA 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV.

Sheffield, South Yorkshire's largest city, grew around rivers, valleys and blast furnaces. Today, however, it's the greenest city in the UK.

The sun streamed into the high vaulted warehouse at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum where the whopping 425-ton, 12,000-horsepower River Don Engine, designed to roll armour plating, chugged into life, small puffs of steam belying the raw power of its rotating pistons. I'd joined a group of onlookers eager to see Europe's most powerful working steam engine as a reminder of the industries that defined this city's heritage.

Sheffield is a hilly place, where neighbourhoods roll over seven gentle peaks that surround the city centre set snugly in the middle of a valley. It's also at the confluence of five water sources – the River Don and its four tributaries, the Sheaf, Rivelin, Loxley and Porter Brook – which played no small part in its evolution.

The fast-flowing water propelled waterwheels that powered hundreds of mills from as early as the 12th Century, and Sheffield became the birthplace of small steel items like cutlery and knife blades. The advancements in technology and scale afforded by the later Industrial Revolution sealed Sheffield's reputation as the leading producer of steel, which is how it earned its tell-tale name, ""The Steel City"".

Yet, this once-mighty industrial powerhouse now has the greenest city centre in Great Britain, with a whopping 61% of its catchment area given over to parks, woodlands and gardens, including one-third of the Peak District National Park, with its exposed moors and scrubby heathland. While the access to the countryside may not be new, the public appreciation of Sheffield as a truly green city has grown in recent years.

Shades of green Sheffield's green credentials aren't limited to trees and parklands. In the 2021 Green Cities Report by NatWest and The University of Southampton, Sheffield emerged as the UK's eco-friendly leader, ranking highly on several criteria including green energy production as well as its goal of becoming a net-zero carbon city by 2050.

A fundamental shift came in 2012 when the city made headlines after council contractors began felling a number of healthy trees to make way for new saplings, something that unsurprisingly upset many local residents. Sheffield's tree debacle rumbled on for years until December 2018 when an agreement was struck between local campaigners and the city's council. From sapling stumps, a great green initiative grew and the innovative Sheffield Street Trees Partnership (SSTP) was created in 2019.

""There has been a lot written about the felling of Sheffield's street trees,"" said Nathan Edwards, Chair of SSTP. ""Some say that the dispute has changed the narrative in the city, connecting people to their green spaces. I think Sheffielders have always had a connection to green space. The street tree-felling incident reenergised and brought to the fore something that perhaps was always there.""

Today, with around 4.5 million trees across the city, Sheffield's tree population far outstrips its human one of just more than 550,000, with more trees per person than any other city in Europe. As Edwards put it, ""this translates to approximately seven trees per resident with a tree cover percentage of 18.4%. This means that nearly one-fifth of the city's surface is covered by trees.""

In 2022, SSTP's work bore fruit when Sheffield was recognised as one of the international Tree Cities of the World by the eponymous organisation that celebrates councils who proactively manage their urban forests.

Visitors to Sheffield can explore the city's green side via the enormous and ambitious Tube-style Greenground Map, which aims to celebrate all 800 of Sheffield's green spaces by highlighting the countless different trails and walking opportunities alongside existing routes like the 15-mile Sheffield Round Walk and the shorter eight-mile Blue Loop.

""I can honestly say it's the coolest city I've worked with,"" said Estonian graphic designer Helen Ilus who created the Greenground Map in 2021. ""I don't know any other UK city with so much open space and opportunities to go out and get active.""

Keen to get out and about myself, I borrowed sections from the Sheffield Round Walk adding an extension into the city centre, hoping to discover both history and green innovations along the way.

My morning began with a steady, puff-inducing climb the River Don Engine would have admired up into leafy Whiteley Woods then a zigzag down the hillside to a footpath alongside the trickling waters of Porter Brook, stopping at the Shepherd Wheel Workshop.

Dating from the late-16th Century, this waterwheel powered grinding stones for sharpening blades. Watching it fill and turn, it was apparent just how inextricably linked Sheffield's natural resources are to its industrial past with weirs, dams and man-made channels visible the length of the rivers.

I then followed the long snaking path through family-favourite Endcliffe Park, with its duck ponds, stepping stones and sports fields, before walking up to the immaculate Sheffield Botanical Gardens, a Grade-II-listed site with period pavilions and a variety of garden styles, from the prim and precise Victorian flowerbeds to the riotous Mediterranean and wild rock gardens – not to mention a rare 19th-Century bear pit.

Here I met Dr Laura Alston, education officer at the gardens, who confirmed, ""it's brilliant to be able to travel through so many green spaces even in the urban environment. We are very lucky in Sheffield.""

Continuing north, I came to Weston Park, the city's first municipal park opened around 1873. When Sheffield was aglow with factories, this ground-breaking park – an initial acknowledgement from the state for the need for green space – would have provided pockets of clean air and sanctuary for wealthier residents.

Thankfully, the importance of access to nature for physical and mental well-being for all is now a given – something demonstrated in the area of West Bar, where an innovative ""Grey to Green"" rewilding and drainage project has taken root. What was a derelict stretch of road is now a thriving, biodiverse corridor of flowers, sculptures, benches, bug hotels and information plaques. The soil is made up of recycled material, while the plants have been specially chosen to improve air quality and welcome wildlife.

It's a real regenerative success story that has given life to this once-neglected part of the city. Bees buzzed in and out of their man-made sanctuaries, colourful flowers swayed in the breeze and a reassuring sense of peace and calm flowed alongside the River Don.

I continued on and up through multiple parks and green spaces to the long tree-lined drive of Norfolk Heritage Park, which Alston had recommended for its ""incredible history and views"". A 28-hectare Victorian creation, this outdoor community space has plenty of room to play, wander and escape the city's busy streets. Looking northwards with an arc of woodland behind me, I marvelled at how the undulating green park spilled away to the valley-dwelling city. As I took in this great expanse of greenery, I felt surprisingly far from the Saturday afternoon bustle below.

As well as being the greenest city in the UK, Sheffield is the second-greenest city in Europe after Oslo, which pips this Yorkshire city to the green post with around 72% of green spaces.

Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.

However, according to Mark Mobbs, manager for city campaigns at Sheffield City Council, ""It's about how those green spaces connect different parts of the city and are usable as part of daily life, not just whether they are enormous areas that may not be that usable.""

He continued, ""I really feel that [Sheffield] has unique accessibility to genuine green space, not just small patches of grass, right from the city centre and throughout the suburbs.""

And perhaps that's the real point. Mobbs says that Sheffield is a place ""where nature and culture go hand in hand... our green spaces [are] part of our city identity."" Maybe that's what will ensure this formerly heavily industrial city continues to evolve sustainably for generations to come.

Cameroon came from behind with two late goals to reach the last 16 of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, beating The Gambia in a thriller to knock their opponents out of the tournament.

The five-time champions secured second place in Group C on goals scored.

Rigobert Song's side will next face Nigeria at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium on Saturday (20:00 GMT).

The Scorpions looked to have dashed Cameroon's hopes with a 91st-minute goal but it was ruled out for handball.

Guinea's 2-0 defeat to group winners Senegal allowed Cameroon to move above them in the final table, although the Syli National will advance as one of the four best third-placed teams at the end of the group stage.

The Gambia manager Tom Saintfiet resigned after their exit without a point but the world's 126th-ranked team - the lowest in the competition - were on course to extend his stay with a huge upset when Ebrima Colley curled them ahead for the first time from a tight angle with less than six minutes of normal time remaining.

Victory for Tom Saintfiet's spirited squad would have put them in contention to go through among the third-placed teams and knocked Cameroon out, only for James Gomez to turn the ball beyond his own goalkeeper, Baboucarr Gaye, two minutes later when the centre-back lunged in to attempt to intercept Enzo Tchato's cross.

Having been on the brink of elimination, Cameroon climbed into second spot a minute into added time when Christopher Wooh rose to head a corner beyond Gaye's dive.

The abundance of late twists continued when Muhammed Sanneh - one of five changes made by Saintfiet - turned in a cross for a goal that was disallowed for handball by a VAR check.

There had been hints of the drama to come during a promising start by the underdogs, who are 80 places below Cameroon in Fifa's rankings and reached the quarter-finals on their debut in 2021.

Cameroon head coach Song dropped Andre Onana in the most high-profile of four alterations to his starting line-up, restoring the Manchester United goalkeeper's cousin, Fabrice Ondoa, in his place.

Ondoa was soon called into action, beating Ali Sowe's angled strike away at his near post as part of an end-to-end first half in which the West African nation had the better chances.

Only a timely block by Jacob Mendy prevented Cameroon forward Karl Toko Ekambi from firing in a close-range shot on the turn, and Ondoa plunged on the recalled Yankuba Minteh's effort when he was left unmarked at the far post to plant a header towards goal from Musa Barrow's corner.

A spell of persistent Gambia pressure ended with Ondoa appearing to plead with his teammates to raise their defensive game, but Cameroon only improved after the break.

After Indomitable Lions forward Georges-Kevin Nkoudou hammered a shot against the crossbar five minutes into the second period, Toko-Ekambi headed Nkoudou's searching delivery in six minutes later to break the deadlock.

The Gambia, however, soon levelled as Ablie Jallow arrived unmarked in the box to deftly volley in from Alieu Fadera's cross.

Toko-Ekambi rattled the crossbar with a fizzing effort before Colley's strike sent shockwaves around the Stade de la Paix, starting the sequence of three goals in six minutes to settle Cameroon's destiny in an extraordinary finish.","The five-time champions secured second place in Group C on goals scored.

Somerset's Shoaib Bashir has been called up by England for the first time despite playing only six first-class matches

Spinner Shoaib Bashir has returned to the UK in order to sort the visa delay which is preventing him from joining the England squad in India.

The uncapped 20-year-old, who is of Pakistani descent, was initially left in Abu Dhabi when the rest of the team travelled on Sunday.

The Somerset off-spinner is still to receive the visa and will not be in India until at least the weekend.

Bashir will miss the first Test in Hyderabad, beginning on Thursday.

""I find it particularly frustrating,"" said England captain Ben Stokes. ""We announced the squad in mid-December, and now Bash finds himself without a visa to get here.

""I am more frustrated for him. I didn't want this type of situation to be his first experience of what it's like to be in the England Test team. I feel for him.""

India have not played any bilateral cricket against Pakistan since 2013 because of political tensions between the two countries.

Bashir, a surprise inclusion in the England Test squad after playing only six first-class matches, is not the first cricketer with links to Pakistan to struggle to gain access to India.

Australia opener Usman Khawaja, who was born in Pakistan, had his arrival for a Test tour last year delayed, while the entire Pakistan squad for last year's World Cup in India faced similar delays.

BBC Test Match Special commentator Aatif Nawaz, whose family are from Pakistan, also faced delays in receiving a visa for the World Cup and ultimately did not travel to the tournament.

Bashir's fellow England spinner, Rehan Ahmed, is also of Pakistani origin, but has a visa held over from last year as he acted as reserve for the World Cup squad.

""He's not the first cricketer to go through this, I have played with a lot of people who have had the same issues,"" added Stokes.

""I find it frustrating that we have picked a player and he's not with us because of visa issues. Especially for a young lad. I'm devastated for him.

""It's a frustrating situation to be in, but a lot of people have been trying to get it through. It's unfortunate and I'm very frustrated for him.""

A spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government expects British citizens to be treated fairly by India's visa processes.

""I can't speak to the specifics of this case. But more broadly we have previously raised issues of this kind with the High Commission. We have been clear that we expect India to treat British citizens fairly at all times in its visa processes,"" said the spokesperson.

""We have previously raised the issues British citizens with Pakistani heritage have experienced. We've raised the issues about their experience of applying for visas with the Indian High Commissioner in London.""

In Bashir's absence, England are considering picking all three of the frontline spinners available to them on what looks to be a dry surface in Hyderabad.

Fit-again Jack Leach could be joined by leg-spinner Ahmed and uncapped Lancashire left-armer Tom Hartley.

If England decide they need two seamers, then Leach will be joined by one of Hartley and Ahmed, probably alongside pace bowlers James Anderson and Mark Wood.

Stokes has confirmed that Ben Foakes will return behind the stumps, with Jonny Bairstow playing as a specialist batter after Harry Brook left the tour for personal reasons.","The Somerset off-spinner is still to receive the visa and will not be in India until at least the weekend.

Defending champions Senegal secured top spot in Group C at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations after beating Guinea 2-0 in an ill-tempered encounter.

Abdoulaye Seck headed the Teranga Lions in front from a free-kick and Iliman Ndiaye sealed victory with a fine low finish in the final minute.

Guinea knew they would go through before kick-off and finished third after Cameroon beat The Gambia 3-2.

Senegal progress from the group stage as the only side with a 100% record.

Aliou Cisse's side will stay in Yamoussoukro and face a third-placed side from Group A or F in the last 16 on Monday, while Guinea will play Group A winners Equatorial Guinea on Sunday in Abidjan.

The Syli National finished third behind Cameroon on goals scored, with their four-point tally meaning four-time continental champions Ghana were eliminated from the finals after the Black Stars ended third in Group B on two points.

Results on Monday meant Guinea were guaranteed to go through as one of four best third-placed sides at the very least, and boss Kaba Diawara made several changes to rest players for the knockout stages.

Both sides were fired up for this West African derby, but there was not a single shot on target in the first half as the teams struggled to create openings.

An early challenge from Senegal midfielder Nampalys Mendy on Guinea's Ilaix Moriba sparked an argument between players, and the first real chance of the game came when a thunderous shot from Mendy was diverted over the bar off the head off Mohamed Ali Camara.

Guinea employed a physical approach but could not provide service to star striker Serhou Guirassy, who was making his first appearance at the tournament following injury and could not get the better of Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly.

The holders appealed for a penalty on the stroke of half-time as star forward Sadio Mane fell to the ground following a duel with Saidou Sow, but referee Pacifique Ndabihawenimana waved play on.

The Burundian official did have work to do in first-half injury time when Ismail Jakobs sparked a mass confrontation which involved both sets of substitutes benches after the Senegal left-back shoved Guinea captain Naby Keita to the ground.

Senegal make experience count

Senegal won all three group games for the first time at the Africa Cup of Nations finals

Mane missed a golden opportunity to open the scoring early in the second half with the goal gaping.

The 31-year-old did the hard work by timing his run well and rounding Guinea goalkeeper Ibrahim Kone, but ultimately failed to direct his shot on target as he skewed wide at the near post.

Mane's miss did affect his side too badly though as Senegal did what they needed to do to win.

Seck headed powerfully into the net following a pinpoint free-kick delivery from Krepin Diatta - with the 61st-minute goal coming from the first shot on target in the game.

Former Sheffield United forward Ndiaye then sealed the win when he received a well-weighted pass from Mane before slotting the ball across goal and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net.

There was still time for Senegal keeper Edouard Mendy to make a fine diving save from Morgan Guilavogui's acrobatic volley, which was Guinea's best chance of the game.

It was not the most convincing performance from Cisse's side but, after beating The Gambia and Cameroon convincingly in their first two group games, they dealt effectively with a physical Guinea side.

Senegal remain on track to become the first side to retain the Afcon trophy since Egypt won their third in a row in 2010, while Guinea will aim to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2015.","Last updated on .From the section FootballDefending champions Senegal secured top spot in Group C at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations after beating Guinea 2-0 in an ill-tempered encounter.

Monday Night Club: 'Newcastle have to sell' but can they afford to lose Trippier?

Newcastle United have turned down a 15m euro (£12.8m) offer from Bayern Munich for right-back Kieran Trippier.

The England international, 33, joined Newcastle from Spanish side Atletico Madrid for £12m in January 2022.

He was Newcastle's first signing since their Saudi Arabian-backed takeover, and the first under manager Eddie Howe.

Ex-Burnley and Spurs defender Trippier has made 62 Premier League appearances for the Magpies and has regularly captained Howe's side this season.

Earlier this month, Newcastle chief executive Darren Eales said the club may have to sell players in order to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules.

Striker Callum Wilson has been linked with a move to AC Milan external-link and winger Miguel Almiron is reportedly a target for Saudi Pro League side Al-Shabab. external-link

German champions Bayern are keen on signing a right-back in the January transfer window.

They have signed England defender Eric Dier from Tottenham on loan for the rest of the season, joining up with former team-mate Harry Kane, who also played alongside Trippier at Spurs.

Trippier, who has 46 caps for England, has played all but two of Newcastle's 21 Premier League games this season, with Howe's side 10th.

Newcastle have had to deal with several key absences this season, with nine first-team players currently out through injury or illness.

Mohamed Salah helped Egypt reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations when it was held in 2022

Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has a ""proper tear in his hamstring"", says assistant manager Pep Lijnders.

Salah, 31, was replaced during Egypt's 2-2 draw with Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast on Thursday.

He watched from the stands as Egypt reached the last 16 thanks to a dramatic 2-2 draw with Cape Verde on Monday.

""It's expected [he will] return in three to four weeks if everything goes smooth,"" said Lijnders.

""It will go smooth and it will go right because of how we've treated his body before.""

Liverpool said Salah will return to the club on Wednesday for an ""intensive rehabilitation programme"".

They said his injury was ""worse than first feared"", but he will be treated with a ""view to being back in action as soon as possible for club and country, giving him the best chance to return to compete at Afcon"".

On Sunday Egypt play the runners-up in Group F for a place in the quarter-finals. The final takes place on 8 February.

On Sunday Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said it ""makes sense"" for Salah to do his rehabilitation at the club and rejoin Egypt if he recovers in time and they remain in the competition.

""I always said before what I'm really happy about is the medical team of Egypt and the medical team of Liverpool really worked together and were in close contact and both made this decision,"" said Lijnders.

""It's an example of how international football and club football should operate to put the player in the centre.""

Egypt's record appearance-maker Ahmed Hassan has said Salah should stay with the team ""even if he only had one leg to stand on"".

""The one you should never doubt the commitment of is Mo Salah,"" said Lijnders.

""I know the country is devastated to lose him. He is massive. The only reason ours and their medical team decided for him to come back is to give the best chance to make the final if Egypt reach it.""

The most recent of Egypt's seven Africa Cup of Nations titles came in 2010, a year before Salah made his debut. Egypt were runners-up in 2017 and 2021.

Salah scored a late penalty to help Egypt draw 2-2 with Mozambique in their opening game.

He said this week that Egypt will win the Africa Cup of Nations ""sooner or later"".

""I would love to win it,"" he said. ""It will happen somehow - that is what I believe. Whatever I believe, I achieve.

West Ham have agreed a deal with Manchester City to sign England midfielder Kalvin Phillips on loan for the rest of the season.

Phillips, 28, signed a six-year contract when he arrived at City from Leeds in a £45m deal in July 2022.

However, he has struggled under Pep Guardiola and has only started twice this term in all competitions.

Phillips, who is also interesting Juventus, now appears set to have a medical in London later this week.

Personal terms are not expected to be a problem, with the Hammers set to cover Phillips' salary and there will be an option to make the move permanent.

Numerous clubs had expressed an interest in the player but City's demand for a sizable loan fee has dissuaded clubs such as Newcastle from pursuing Phillips.

Phillips, who remains a member of Gareth Southgate's England squad, is flying back to the UK today with the rest of the City squad from a warm-weather training camp in Abu Dhabi.

The temporary recruitment of Phillips will come as a boost to Hammers boss David Moyes, who has been eager to strengthen a squad weakened by a succession of injuries.

Meanwhile, Phillips, who has started just two games in the English top flight in 18 months, is likely to view it as an opportunity to showcase his talents prior to this summer's European Championship in Germany.","Last updated on .From the section West HamKalvin Phillips has not started a Premier League game for Manchester City this seasonWest Ham have agreed a deal with Manchester City to sign England midfielder Kalvin Phillips on loan for the rest of the season.
