Watch: Gaza hospital in chaos after nearby air strike

An estimated 150,000 Palestinians are being forced to flee areas of central Gaza, the UN has said, as Israeli forces advance on refugee camps there.

Witnesses and Hamas's armed wing reported that tanks had reached the eastern outskirts of Bureij camp.

Israel's military recently expanded its ground offensive to target Bureij and nearby Nuseirat and Maghazi camps.

Israeli bombardment also killed dozens of people across Gaza on Thursday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.

Egypt has confirmed that it has put forward a three-stage proposal to stop the fighting which ends with a ceasefire.

A Hamas delegation is said to have arrived in Cairo to give its response to the plan.

The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

More than 21,300 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the health ministry.

The Israeli military has called for the evacuation of a strip of land stretching across central Gaza that includes Bureij and Nuseirat camps, and told the almost 90,000 residents and 61,000 displaced people in the affected areas to move southwards to the town of Deir al-Balah.

However, the UN warned on Thursday that they had nowhere to go because Deir al-Balah was already overcrowded, with several hundred thousand displaced people sheltering there.

The UN says that Rafah - which had already become the most densely populated town in Gaza - has seen about 100,000 new arrivals in recent days as Israeli ground forces have pushed into new neighbourhoods.

Omar, 60, said he had been forced to flee Bureij along with at least 35 members of his family.

""That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,"" he told Reuters news agency by phone. ""We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war.""

Tom White, Gaza director for UN relief agency UNRWA, said more and more people were being pushed into the southern Gaza town of Rafah, ""so more people into a very small strip of land that cannot support them"".

On Thursday evening, Gaza's health ministry reported that 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in Rafah that was reportedly housing displaced civilians.

On Thursday morning, the ministry's spokesman announced that 50 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in Maghazi, the northern town of Beit Lahia and in the southern city of Khan Younis.

The deadliest incident was in Beit Lahia, where Palestinian media reported that 30 were killed when a block of four residential buildings was destroyed.

A local TV journalist, Bassel Kheir al-Din, told the Associated Press news agency that 12 members of his family were buried beneath the rubble of one of the buildings and presumed dead, and that nine of their neighbours were missing.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 people had been killed when Israeli shellfire hit an apartment near al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, a day after a similar incident in front of the facility reportedly left 31 dead.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Wednesday that the city was ""a main Hamas terror centre"".

He also said troops were fighting in the Bureij area for a third day, adding that they were ""eliminating many terrorists and destroying terrorist infrastructure"".

Residents told Reuters that the heavy fighting continued on Thursday, with Israeli tanks advancing on the densely populated Bureij camp from the north and east. Hamas posted a video showing what it said was its fighters targeting Israeli soldiers and vehicles.

In a separate development, the IDF said it regretted the ""harm caused to uninvolved civilians"" resulting from an air strike in Maghazi on Sunday that killed at least 70 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Its statement said fighter jets had ""struck two targets adjacent to which Hamas operatives were located"".

In Israel, thousands of teenagers took part in a march to demand a new deal to return the more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza. Many of the demonstrators were from the communities worst affected by the 7 October attacks.

""I'm from Kibbutz Kfar Aza,"" Shiri Khiyali told the BBC. ""I was there on 7 October. My people were kidnapped. We want them back. We want them back now.""

Separately, there was a new call from UN human rights chief Volker Türk urging Israel to stop what he called ""unlawful"" killings in the occupied West Bank.

A report said the UN had verified the killing of 300 Palestinians by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since 7 October.

A spokeswoman for Israel's prime minister dismissed the report as quite ridiculous and said it belittled the major security threats to Israelis.

Watch: Maine's top election official on why she removed Trump from ballot

Maine's top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Mr Trump was not eligible because of his actions leading up to the US Capitol riot in 2021.

Maine now joins Colorado as the two states to ban Mr Trump from the ballot.

The decisions increase pressure on the Supreme Court to weigh in.

Colorado votes reliably Democratic, however, Maine is more politically competitive and would be more significant for Mr Trump - the Republican frontrunner - to lose.

The 34-page ruling says that Mr Trump must be removed from the Maine ballot because of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution - which bans anyone from holding office that has ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"".

In her order, Mrs Bellows says that Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6, 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"".

She added that his ""occasional requests that rioters be peaceful and support law enforcement do not immunize his actions"".

Speaking with BBC News, Mrs Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the ""Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide"".

""I'm mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment. But I'm also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection.""

Mr Trump's campaign had previously called for Mrs Bellows to recuse herself from the process, and on Thursday swiftly criticised her decision.

Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called Mrs Bellows ""a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat"" and claimed she was engaging in ""election interference"".

He added that the campaign will ""quickly file a legal objection in state court to prevent this atrocious decision in Maine from taking effect"".

Mr Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy has been challenged in multiple states, on the grounds that the 14th Amendment bans him from holding office.

The 14th amendment was ratified after the American Civil War in order to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power after southern states re-joined the Union.

Colorado's ban was the first instance of the Constitution being used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

Watch: Trump says indictments are ""badge of honour"" at campaign event following his removal from Colorado ballot

But legal experts say the Colorado ruling will have a tough time standing up when it reaches the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court.

And state courts in Michigan and Minnesota have also recently dismissed efforts to block Mr Trump from the ballot.

The case to remove him in the New England state was brought by a handful of former Maine lawmakers who argued that the former president had violated his oath of office.

Former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno told BBC News he believed there was ""no way this holds up"".

""It's breathtakingly arrogant for her to unilaterally decide that someone has committed insurrection,"" Moreno said about Mrs Bellows' ruling.

""This will create a political furore… that's the unfortunate outcome here,"" he said, adding he found Maine and Colorado to be ""very shaky legal decisions"".

It all leads to a Supreme Court showdown - which Mr Moreno said should take place ""rapidly"" to stop more states from individually determining Trump's eligibility.

Thursday's ruling is the latest in a growing list of legal woes Mr Trump faces.

He also has upcoming trials in federal court and in the state of Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.","Trump blocked from Maine presidential ballot in 2024By Max Matza BBC NewsWatch: Maine's top election official on why she removed Trump from ballotMaine's top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause.

Blanchard family

Gypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee Blanchard

A woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard, 32, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Dee Dee Blanchard in Missouri in 2015.

She plotted with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother following years of abuse.

He stabbed Dee Dee Blanchard to death with a knife her daughter gave him and the pair fled the scene.

They were then arrested hundreds of miles away in Wisconsin where Godejohn lived. He is serving a life sentence without parole.

The case sparked intense media interest and spawned a number of documentary series and TV shows.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard walked out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri at 03:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Thursday having served seven years of a 10-year sentence.

While in prison, she gave a number of interviews detailing her mother's abusive behaviour and a memoir she wrote while behind bars is due to be published in January.

In a recent interview with People Magazine she said: ""Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.""

Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly abused her daughter for years by convincing her that she was disabled and required medical support.

She told people that Blanchard had multiple conditions including epilepsy, vision impairments and muscular dystrophy.

She received support from charities and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, often portraying her daughter as younger than she actually was and subjecting her to unneeded medical treatments.

Blanchard used a wheelchair, feeding tube and an oxygen tank even though she could walk and had no health issues.

She later said her mother kept her weak and isolated. Blanchard soon became more interested in the outside world, making a dating profile and meeting Godejohn.

""I wanted to be free of her hold on me,"" she said during Godejohn's trial. ""I talked him into it.""

She reached a plea deal with prosecutors due to the abuse she had suffered, which meant a 10-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty.","Gypsy Rose Blanchard released early from US prisonBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsBlanchard familyGypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee BlanchardA woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Cher has filed for a conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman due to his alleged substance abuse and mental health issues.

Court documents seen by the BBC claim Mr Allman, 47, is ""substantially unable to manage his financial resources"".

In the documents, lawyers for Cher say a conservator is ""urgently needed"" to protect his property and physical and mental health.

Cher's publicist has been approached for comment.

Mr Allman has not commented publicly on the legal filing. He recently posted the hashtag ""#imprisonmentviaconservatorship"" on an Instagram post.

A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.

It can be used to manage a person's financial affairs or personal affairs or both.

Mr Allman is due to receive assets from a trust before the end of the year.

The documents state he is entitled to regular payments from the trust set up by his late father, musician Gregg Allman.

The court papers, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, state Mr Allman is ""currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues"".

The filing adds: ""Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, [Cher] is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk.""

It says that Cher, 77, has ""worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs"".

A hearing for a temporary order is currently set for 5 January, with the hearing on a permanent order scheduled for 6 March.

Cher recently denied allegations that she hired four men to kidnap Mr Allman from a New York City hotel room.

The singer told People Magazine ""that rumour is not true"".

Cher was married to Greg Allman from 1975 to 1979. She was previously married to her former singing partner Sonny Bono from 1964 to 1975. She also has a child, Chaz Bono, from that relationship.

Hostages and Missing Families Forum

Judi and Gadi Haggai were wounded near Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October

An Israeli-American-Canadian national thought to be being held hostage in Gaza was killed by Hamas in the 7 October attack on Israel, the kibbutz community she was taken from says.

Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, was ""fatally wounded"" during the raid on Kibbutz Nir Oz, the statement said.

Her husband, Gadi Haggai, 73, was also killed by Hamas, the White House announced last week.

Their bodies are being held in Gaza, a Nir Oz spokesperson said.

Following confirmation of Mr Haggai's death last week, the family had expressed hope that Ms Haggai was still alive.

Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement that it was with ""great sorrow"" that they announced the death of Ms Weinstein.

It described her as an English teacher who had specialised in teaching children with additional needs, adding that she was ""a poet, entrepreneur, and pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region"".

The Haggai family said in a statement cited by AFP that ""there are no words to describe the pain of losing our parents and grandparents to the massacre that took place on our kibbutz.

""We pray that their bodies... will be soon returned to us, and that their murders are a reminder for leaders everywhere to bring the hostages home now before it is too late.""

US President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was ""devastated"" to learn of Mr Haggai's death.

""This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week's news that Judith's beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas.""

Mr Biden said he would ""never forget"" what the Haggai's daughter and other relatives of US hostages held in Gaza have shared with him.

""They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.""

Ms Haggai had family ties to New York state in the US, the BBC's US partner CBS reports. In a post on X, New York state Governor Kathy Hochul said she was ""heartbroken to learn"" of Ms Weinstein's death.

""My heart is with her family abroad and those still here in New York. May her memory be a blessing and may the many hostages still in captivity be brought home safely.""

On the day of the 7 October attack, Ms Haggai had been out on a walk with her husband near Nir Oz.

Upon hearing sirens, she sent a short video of the scene to a group chat. She also alerted friends and family members that they had been wounded, before ceasing contact.

Speaking to the Times of Israel after the attack, the couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai said her mother had told her they had been ""shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad"".

""Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket,"" she said.

Approximately 240 hostages were taken during the Hamas raid on Israel on 7 October, which left 1,200 people dead.

Of that total, 110 were freed during a temporary ceasefire in late November. A further 23 were declared dead in absentia on Thursday, an Israeli government spokesperson quoted by Reuters news agency said.

Last week, the White House said it believed eight Americans were still in Hamas captivity.

During a meeting with representatives of families of the hostages on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""we will not give up on anyone"".

""We are working to return them all. This is our goal.""

His comments followed demonstrations by thousands of teenagers, who walked towards the Israeli parliament - the Knesset - earlier on Thursday demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.","Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, was ""fatally wounded"" during the raid on Kibbutz Nir Oz, the statement said.

By BBC Chinese In Toronto & Singapore

Tony Chung was a former leader of a fringe pro-independence group called Studentlocalism

A prominent pro-democracy activist has fled Hong Kong to seek asylum in the UK, breaching a supervision order.

Tony Chung, 22, told the BBC he had been under constant scrutiny in Hong Kong, where police had put him under an ""enormous amount of stress"".

He also claimed he had felt compelled by police to become a paid informant, giving information on fellow activists.

Chung was convicted of calling for Hong Kong's secession under a tough security law. He finished his sentence in June.

But upon his release, he says he was thrown into a situation that was ""an even bigger and more dangerous prison"" than the one he had left.

He is under a one-year supervision order which required him to apply for permission to travel overseas. Authorities allowed him to go to Japan on 20 December for a six-day holiday.

While he was there, he said he started crying at the thought of not returning to Hong Kong and decided to seek asylum in the UK.

The BBC has reached out to Hong Kong police for comment.

Chung is one of several pro-democracy protesters who have fled Hong Kong in recent years.

Following months of mass demonstrations in 2019, Beijing imposed a strict national security law which it said was needed to bring stability to the city. The legislation, which outlaws many forms of dissent, has been widely used against activists like Chung.

AFP

The protests calling for more democracy in Hong Kong often escalated into violent clashes

In late 2021, he was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison for arguing that Hong Kong should pursue independence. Studentlocalism, the fringe group he led, had disbanded before the law came into force.

He was also found guilty of insulting the national flag in a separate case in December 2020. He had been arrested near the US consulate in October of that year - supporters say he had been on his way to claim political asylum.

Chung claimed that after his release on 5 June, the national security police requested meetings with him every two to four weeks, questioning him on every detail of his activities, including information about anyone he was meeting and in contact with.

""They told me they are going to meet up with me regularly in the following year,"" he said. ""How could I reject them? I cannot say no to them at all.""

He said police also asked him to report the whereabouts and activities of other pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.

""Although I insisted on only providing irrelevant information,"" Chung said, ""I couldn't face the fact that I am giving out other people's information to the police.""

When the police were dissatisfied with his answers, they used intimidation to coerce him into divulging more information, he said.

""They told me... they need me to prove I am trustworthy and have nothing to hide. This put me under an enormous amount of stress. I [couldn't] tell those people that they had already been targeted.""

A confidential declaration he signed before his release from prison restricted him from disclosing the interactions with the national security police to any third parties, including lawyers, he said.

After two months of regular meetings, the police offered him money, ranging from HKD$500 ($64; £49) to HKD$3,000, after their conversations, he said.

He said he felt he ""didn't have a choice"" - because not accepting the payments would raise suspicions he was being ""uncooperative"".

But taking the money made him feel guilty. ""Although the information I gave is not likely to lead to any tangible consequences, I still feel that way,"" he said.

Chung added that he felt like he had no control over his life, adding that police had all his personal information, including copies of bank details, student ID and school schedule, on file.

""I could never relax, not even for a second,"" he said, adding that even something as simple as a walk became stressful to him - as he felt he constantly had to think about how to justify his actions to police and feared arrest.

The police required regular meetings and wanted to know who he was in touch with, Tony Chung said

As the constant pressure weighed on his mental and physical health, he started to plan to travel abroad. The Hong Kong Correctional Services authorised him to travel to Japan from 20 December on condition he came home on 25 December.

""As I was planning my next steps in the hotel [in Japan], I started crying. I had thought of the reality of having to leave Hong Kong one day, but I still wasn't prepared for leaving this soon,"" he said.

""But the decision is irreversible now, at least in the near future.""

Now he's in the UK he hopes to resume his studies and focus on regaining his health.

""And after I have settled down, I hope I can still do something for Hong Kong.""

Earlier this month, high-profile pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow announced on social media that she had jumped bail and would not return to Hong Kong following her studies in Canada.

Chow, who was arrested for ""colluding with foreign forces"" under the national security law, also pointed to the tight government restrictions. She was granted permission to study abroad while under investigation.

While Chow and Chung are now among pro-democracy activists outside Hong Kong, many others remain on trial in the territory.

By Madeline Halpert BBC News, New York

Watch: Haley leaves out slavery as a cause of US Civil War

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says the US Civil War was about slavery after facing criticism for not mentioning it as a cause during a town hall event.

A voter in New Hampshire on Wednesday asked her what caused the war.

Appearing startled by the question, she did not name slavery in her response.

""I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do,"" she said.

Her remarks were quickly criticised by the voter who asked the question. He said that it was ""astonishing"" that she answered without mentioning the word slavery in the year 2023.

""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" Ms Haley responded.

But after facing a blowback on social media, the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor acknowledged it as a cause on Thursday.

""Of course the Civil War was about slavery,"" she told CNN.

""We know that. That's the easy part of it. What I was saying was what does it mean to us today? What it means to us today is about freedom. That's what that was all about.""

Speaking to radio station The Pulse of NH on Thursday, Ms Haley also claimed the voter was a ""Democrat plant"".

The Wednesday event in Berlin, New Hampshire was a part of Ms Haley's push to win over voters before the early upcoming Republican primary election in the state.

Ms Haley has risen in opinion polls in recent weeks.

She faces her first test at the Iowa caucuses in early January. While she trails behind former President Donald Trump by a wide margin, she is neck-and-neck with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another high-profile challenger.

President Joe Biden was among the dozens of Democrats who criticised Ms Haley after her comments in New Hampshire. He posted a video of her exchange on X, formerly Twitter, with the caption: ""It was about slavery.""

Her Republican political opponents also seized on the controversy. A campaign account for Mr DeSantis shared a video of her comments with one word: ""Yikes"".

A number of civil rights scholars weighed in as well, saying the fight over slavery was a central cause of the Civil War.

South Carolina was the first state to secede during the Civil War and as a former state governor Ms Haley has faced questions about the issue before.

When she was running for governor in 2010, she described the Civil War as a conflict between two sides fighting for ""tradition versus change"".","Nikki Haley says slavery was a US Civil War cause after backlashBy Madeline Halpert BBC News, New YorkWatch: Haley leaves out slavery as a cause of US Civil WarRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says the US Civil War was about slavery after facing criticism for not mentioning it as a cause during a town hall event.

Boeing has recommended that the checks - which only take around two hours - take place within the next two weeks.

Any problems involving a faulty rudder would likely be identified in a pre-flight check, as crews routinely examine the rudder system before flying, Boeing said.

Donald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was made

Donald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The former president made a brief appearance in the 1992 film in a scene filmed at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time.

Director Chris Columbus said Mr Trump insisted on appearing in the film if they used the hotel as a location.

But Mr Trump said the filmmakers were ""begging"" him to appear.

""I was very busy, and didn't want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.

""I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time,"" he said. ""People call me whenever it is aired.""

By Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, Sweden

Modvion

Engineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine tower

What is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

If that calls to mind flat-pack furniture and meatballs, you're wrong.

If you answered ""a wooden wind turbine"", you could be a visionary.

According to Modvion, the Swedish start-up that has just built the world's tallest wooden turbine tower, using wood for wind power is the future.

""It's got great potential,"" Otto Lundman, the company's chief executive, says as we gaze upwards at the firm's brand new turbine, a short drive outside Gothenburg.

It's 150m (492ft) to the tip of the highest blade and we are the first journalists to be invited to have a look inside. The 2 megawatt generator on top has just started supplying electricity to the Swedish grid, providing power for about 400 homes.

The dream of Lundman and Modvion is to take the wood and wind much higher.

Steel limitations

On the horizon near the Modvion project, several very similar-looking turbines are turning.

Steel, not wood, is the key material for them, as it is for almost all of the world's turbine towers. Strong and durable, steel has enabled huge turbines and wind farms to be constructed on land and at sea.

Modvion

The blades and generator from this 150m wind turbine in Skara, Sweden, are made of conventional materials

But steel is not without its limitations, particularly for projects on land.

As demand has grown for taller turbines that harvest stronger winds with larger generators, the diameter of the cylindrical steel towers to support them has had to grow too.

In a world of road tunnels, bridges and roundabouts, many in the wind industry say getting those huge pieces of metal to turbine sites has become a real headache, in effect limiting how tall new steel turbines can be.

Wooden turbine or sauna?

From the outside, there is little obvious difference between the Modvion wooden turbine and its steel cousins.

Both have a thick white coating to protect them from the elements and blades made primarily from fibreglass attached to a generator, which produces electricity when it turns.

It is only when we go inside the tower that the differences becomes clear. The walls have a curved raw wood finish, not unlike a sauna.

Kevin Church/BBC

Otto Lundman of Modvion shows Jonah the interior of the wooden turbine

The 105m (345ft) tower's strength comes from the 144 layers of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) that make its thick walls.

By varying the grain of each of the 3mm-thick layers of spruce, Modvion says it has been able to control the wall's strength and flexibility. ""It's our secret recipe,"" says company co-founder - and former architect and boat builder - David Olivegren, with a smile.

At the factory, on the edge of Gothenburg, the thin layers of wood have been glued and compressed together to make the curved sections. Those pieces are then taken on site, glued together into cylinders and then stacked on top of each other to make the tower.

""Wood and glue is the perfect combination, we've known that for hundreds of years,"" Olivegren says. ""And because using wood is lighter [than steel] you can build taller turbines with less material.""

David Olivegren of Modvion inspects a modular section of the wooden turbine tower in the factory

Lundman and Olivegren tell me their turbine's big selling point is that, by using wood and glue, towers can be built in smaller, more easily transported modules.

That will make it much easier to build really tall towers, they say, and to take the pieces to challenging locations.

However, Dr Maximilian Schnippering, head of sustainability at Siemens Gamesa - one of the worlds largest turbine manufacturers - says more pieces are likely to mean more trucks, more people and more time to complete the installation. He considers the modular system ""an advantage"" and that wooden towers can ""nicely complement"" steel towers.

Siemens Gamesa's efforts are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the steel it uses, he says.

Inside the Modvion tower, I am shown how the wooden modules have been stacked on top of each other and how they are held by steel fittings that are then glued into place.

""The industry wants to build turbines with a 300m [blade] tip height, which means a tower which is 200m or more in height. With modularity you can do that,"" says Lundman.

The wooden parts of the turbine tower are glued together on site

Steel could of course be modular too, with the cylinders cut up into smaller pieces, but the extra effort needed to then bolt the pieces together adds both to costs and to maintenance.

One of the investors in Modvion is renewable energy giant Vestas. It has installed more wind power capacity around the world than any other.

Jan Hagen, its chief technology officer for northern and central Europe, tells me they see ""tremendous potential"" in the market for taller turbines, with wooden turbines ""particularly well suited"" to play a role.

""What we find interesting about this is that its combination of an economically viable solution that addresses the transport bottleneck and a sustainable solution,"" Hagen says.

Negative carbon footprint

Though wind power is cheaper and cleaner than almost all other forms of electricity generation, making steel involves extremely hot furnaces and almost always the burning of fossil fuels. That means CO2 emissions - the main driver of climate change.

Modvion says using wood instead of steel eliminates the wind turbines' carbon footprint entirely, making them carbon negative.

That's because the trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere when they are alive and, when they are chopped down, the carbon is stored in the wood. As long as the wood doesn't end up rotting or being burned, the carbon is not released.

About 200 trees went into Modvion's turbine tower. They were the same species - spruce - that is used for Christmas trees and the company says they are farmed sustainably, meaning when they are harvested more are planted.

SSE Renewables, one of the UK's largest producers of wind power, told the BBC it was aware of Modvion's work and that it would be looking into wooden towers as ""an alternative technology"" to steel. However, many of SSE's projects are offshore, which can be reached using huge ships - meaning the modular transport benefits are less pronounced.

Modvion says it is hoping to build another even taller turbine soon and, if all goes well, it will open a facility that will produce 100 wooden modular turbines a year in 2027.

""The industry is currently putting up 20,000 turbines a year,"" Lundman says. ""Our ambition is that in 10 years time 10% of those turbines - about 2000 - will be wooden.""","World's tallest wooden wind turbine starts turningBy Jonah Fisher BBC environment correspondent in Skara, SwedenModvionEngineers work on the construction of the world's tallest wooden turbine towerWhat is made from the same wood as a Christmas tree, held together by glue and manufactured in a Swedish factory for assembly later?

The conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year. The front lines have hardly moved in the last few months but could the course of the war change in 2024?

President Volodomyr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped. Russia still controls about 18% of Ukraine.

We asked three military analysts how they think events may unfold in the coming 12 months.

War will drag on but not indefinitely

Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London

The prospects for an end of the war in Ukraine remain bleak. Compared with this time last year, Vladimir Putin is stronger, politically more than militarily.

The situation on the battleground remains uncertain. Recently, Ukraine's winter offensive seems to have come to a halt. But there is no Russian breakthrough, either. More than ever, the outcome depends on political decisions made miles away from the centre of the conflict - in Washington and in Brussels.

The West's impressive show of unity displayed in 2022, and that endured throughout 2023, is starting to vacillate.

The US defence aid package is held hostage by what President Biden rightly labelled ""petty politics"" in Washington. And the future of the EU's economic aid is seemingly dependent on Hungary's incongruous stance.

Hesitation in the West's capitals has emboldened Putin. His recent public appearances and defiant statements demonstrate that as far as he is concerned, Russia is in this for the long haul.

Getty Images

So, will the West have the strength and stamina to continue to oppose him and all that he represents?

The EU's decision to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova is more than just symbolic. It implicitly means continued backing for Kyiv, as a future in the EU for Ukraine would be impossible with a full-blown victory for Russia.

In Washington, a complete reversal of policy is unlikely.

While it is tempting to depict doomsday scenarios for US assistance as Trump's ratings rise in the polls, the former president, amid all the theatrics, did not walk out from Nato in 2016. And he would not singlehandedly be able to revolutionise America's 75-year-long transatlantic partnership.

This is not to say that the recent cracks in the Western camp are meaningless. For the West, and therefore for Ukraine, 2024 will be more difficult.

For democracies, long-term consensus in support for war has always been more complicated than for autocrats with no accountability.

While it is likely that the war will drag on throughout 2024, it cannot drag on indefinitely.

With Western hesitancy bolstering Russia, and in the absence of either a coup or a health-related issue leading to Putin's demise, the only foreseeable outcome will be a negotiated settlement that for now both sides continue to refuse.

The course of war in 2024 will be determined elsewhere

Michael Clarke, former director general of the Royal United Services Institute

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the return of major war to the European continent. The course of the conflict in 2023 marked the fact that industrial-age warfare had returned too.

Industrial-age warfare bends significant parts, or in some cases whole economies, towards the production of war materials as matters of priority. Russia's defence budget has tripled since 2021 and will consume 30% of government spending next year.

This will make the war in Ukraine a longer and more traumatic enterprise than anything Europe has known since the middle of the last century. The coming year will demonstrate whether Russia - and its suppliers in North Korea and Iran - or Ukraine - and its Western backers - are able and prepared to meet the voracious demands of industrial-age warfare.

It would be wrong to say that the front lines in Ukraine are stalemated, but both sides are capable of fighting each other to a standstill as they each try to take strategic initiatives.

Russian forces may try to push again along the entire front, at least to secure all of the Donbas region. Ukraine will probably try to exploit the success it has had in re-establishing its control over the western Black Sea and its vital trade corridor to the Bosphorus.

And Kyiv will likely also try to spring more military surprises on the Russian invaders to knock them off-balance in some areas.

But in essence, 2024 looks like being a year of consolidation for both Kyiv and Moscow.

Russia lacks the equipment and trained manpower to launch a strategic offensive until spring 2025, at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Ukraine needs Western finance and military support to keep it in the war during next year while it, too, builds up its intrinsic strengths to create the conditions for a series of liberating offensives in the future.

Industrial-age warfare is a struggle between societies. What happens on the battlefield becomes ultimately only the symptom of that struggle.

The military course of this war in 2024 will be determined in Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang more than in Avdiivka, Tokmak, Kramatorsk or any of the devastated battlefields along the frontlines.

US fighter jets could make a difference

Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe

Russia lacks a decisive, breakthrough capability to overrun Ukraine and will do what it can to hold on to what it currently occupies, using the time to strengthen its defences while it hopes for the West to lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.

But Ukraine will not stop. It is in a fight for its survival and understands what Russia will do if it stops. More European nations are now talking about the need to step up aid in light of concerns that the US is weakening in its resolve.

Getty Images

I do, however, anticipate that early in the new year the US will rediscover its strategic backbone and pass the aid package that was delayed in Congress in December.

Therefore, I anticipate Ukraine will do the following in the coming months as it prepares to regain the initiative:

reconstitute units which have been worn down from months of fighting, which will be necessary for a renewed offensive

improve the recruiting system within Ukraine to maximise available manpower

increase production of ammunition and weapons

improve its ability to operate against strong Russian electronic warfare capabilities - jamming, intercepting, locating.

By early summer Ukraine will be able to use US-made F16 fighter jets for the first time, which it hopes will improve its ability to counter Russian aircraft and strengthen its own air defences.

The most strategically important part of Ukraine that remains occupied by Russia is Crimea, which is what we call the ""decisive terrain"".

Ukraine will do all it can to keep pressure on the Russians there to make it untenable for the Russian navy in Sevastopol, the handful of air force bases there and their logistics base at Dzankoy.

They have already proven the concept. With just three UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles, they have forced the commander of the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw a third of his fleet from Sevastopol.

The White House has approved another tranche of US military aid to Ukraine worth some $250m (£195m).

The latest package includes air defence, artillery and small arms ammunition, and anti-tank weapons, US officials say.

But it marks the last funding available without fresh approval from Congress, where talks have stalled.

Ukraine has warned that the war effort and its public finances are at risk if further Western aid is not forthcoming.

Amid a stalled counter-offensive in the east of the country and a little-changed line of control, Ukrainian officials are facing the prospect of a slowdown in aid from allies in Washington and Europe.

Although the Ukraine war effort has broad support in the US Congress, an agreement on further arms has been stopped by Republicans who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.

An emergency spending measure that would have provided $50bn for Ukraine and $14bn for Israel was defeated in the Senate earlier this month, with every Republican voting against it - along with Bernie Sanders, an independent who usually votes with Democrats but has expressed concerns about Israel's war against Hamas.

A subsequent visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to sway lawmakers.

Wednesday's announcement will see the weapons pulled from existing Pentagon stocks, a move which does not need Congressional approval.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement announcing the aid package that it was ""imperative that Congress act swiftly, as soon as possible, to advance our national security interests by helping Ukraine defend itself and secure its future"".

""Our assistance has been critical to supporting our Ukrainian partners as they defend their country and their freedom against Russia's aggression,"" he added.

Earlier this month a €50bn EU aid package for Ukraine was blocked by Hungary.

Ukraine is facing a $43bn budget deficit and officials say they may have to delay salaries and pensions for government employees if further aid from the West does not come soon.

""The support of partners is extremely critical,"" Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as the country's economy minister, said in an interview with the Financial Times on Wednesday. ""We need it urgently.""

The newspaper reported that talks were progressing on a smaller aid package that would not need Hungary's approval, which could be taken up in early February.

As funding has slowed from Ukraine's Western allies, Russian forces have continued to fight in the east of the country, where they seized a key town on Tuesday.","Ukraine war: US releases last military aid for Kyiv for nowBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsReutersA Ukrainian soldier near the front line in Donetsk this weekThe White House has approved another tranche of US military aid to Ukraine worth some $250m (£195m).

By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney

The average price of a home in Sydney is over A$1m (£535,000, $678,000)

At the age of 31, Justin Dowswell never imagined he'd be living in a shared room in his childhood home.

He had a full-time, well-paying job in Sydney, and had rented for a decade before an unprecedented housing crisis forced him to upend his life and move back in with his parents, two hours away.

""It's humbling,"" he says. But the alternative was homelessness: ""So I'm one of the lucky ones"".

It's a far cry from the promise of the Great Australian Dream.

Where the American Dream is a more abstract belief that anyone can achieve success if they work hard enough, the Australian version is tangible.

For generations, owning a house on a modest block of land has been idealised as both the ultimate marker of success and a gateway to a better life.

It's an aspiration that has wormed its way into the country's identity, helping to shape modern Australia.

From the so-called ""Ten Pound Poms"" in the 1950s to the current boom in skilled workers moving from India, waves of migrants have arrived on Australia's shores in search of its promise. And many found it.

But for current generations the dreams proffered to their parents and grandparents are out of reach.

After decades of government policies that treat housing as an investment not a right, many say they would be lucky to even find a stable, affordable place to rent.

""The Australian Dream… it's a big lie,"" Mr Dowswell says.

A perfect storm

Almost everything that could go wrong with housing in Australia has gone wrong, says Michael Fotheringham.

""The only thing that could make it worse is if banks started collapsing,"" the head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute tells the BBC.

Underpinning it all is that buying a house is astronomically expensive - the average property now costs about nine times an ordinary household's income, triple what it was 25 years ago.

It's particularly dire for the three quarters of Australians who live in major cities. Sydney, for example, is the second least affordable city on Earth to buy a property, trailing only Hong Kong, according to the 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.

Australia has made home ownership virtually unattainable for almost anyone without family wealth. Last month the boss of a major bank, ANZ, said home loans had become ""the preserve of the rich"".

Chelsea Hickman and Justin Dowswell feel let down

That's left people like Chelsea Hickman questioning their future. The 28-year-old fashion designer always imagined she'd become both a homeowner and a mother, but now worries that may be impossible.

""Financially, how could I ever afford both? The numbers just do not add up,"" she says.

She tells the BBC from her Melbourne shared house that despite working full-time for almost a decade, she can't even afford to rent an apartment by herself. Her friends are in a similar boat.

""Where did it go wrong?"" she says.

""We did everything that everyone said we should do, and we're still not reaching this point where we're going to have financial independence and housing security.""

Tarek Bieganski, a 26-year-old IT manager, laughs when asked if he thinks he'll ever own property.

""It's just so obviously out of reach that it's not really even a thought anymore,"" he says. ""And this is coming from someone that, really, has got it pretty good.""

But with interest rates rising faster than at any time in Australia's history, even many of those who have scraped their way on to the property ladder now live in fear of falling off it.

Foodbanks are being overwhelmed by mortgage holders struggling to keep their heads above water. Hordes of people are picking up extra jobs. Many pensioners have been forced back into work.

It's not doom and gloom for everyone though.

Many existing homeowners do not want to see house prices stabilise

The level of home ownership across the nation - while significantly dropping for young people - has overall stayed around two-thirds.

And those Australians are quite content to see house prices climb and their wealth grow.

That's difficult to stomach, Ms Hickman says, especially given how many households - one in three - now own a property other than the one they live in.

""I understand that people are like 'Well, I worked hard to get these millions of houses' and blah, blah, blah, and I'm like, 'Okay, well, good for you. I work hard too and I just want one house'.""

'Grapes of Wrath stuff'

As a result, millions of people are trapped in the rental market, seeking to create a watered-down version of the Australian Dream as tenants.

But that's no paradise either.

Vacancies are at unprecedented, prolonged lows - to the point that councils across the country are begging people with empty holiday homes and short-term rentals to move them on to the long-term market.

And, with the greater demand, rents are skyrocketing.

Australian news has been awash with stories of massive rent increases and images of desperate people queuing to inspect properties riddled with defects and - in some cases - obviously covered in mould.

""It's Grapes of Wrath stuff,"" Dr Fotheringham says, referring to the famous Great Depression-era novel about a family struggling to build a life.

ABC News

A line of people waiting to inspect a house in Sydney

Social or subsidised housing - once a safety net for those on low or moderate incomes - is not an option for most Australians either. The number of homes available is less than half of what is needed to meet immediate demand and wait lists are years long.

And all of this is happening at a time when natural disasters and climate effects are wiping out swathes of housing stock, making even more parts of the vast Australian continent effectively unliveable.

The crisis is tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions. Demand for housing support is so high that some charities say they've been handing out tents.

One Tasmanian woman told the BBC she and her four kids spent over six months crammed into her mother's spare room after the family was knocked back for more than 35 properties while languishing on the social housing wait list.

Melbourne woman Hayley Van Ree told us her rental prospects were so bleak that her mother raided her own retirement fund to buy an apartment and is now Ms Van Ree's landlord - eliciting what she describes as a confusing mix of relief, embarrassment and guilt.

""Friends who have parents who are in property have this kind of morbid knowledge that when their parents die, they might be ok,"" Ms Van Ree says. ""I hate that it's my reality.""

Supplied

Ms Van Ree says she knows plenty of people with ""just fine"" jobs who can't secure a home

Mr Dowswell is now back in Sydney, having finally secured an apartment after six months, but says the ordeal has been a massive tax on his finances and mental health.

""It was just demoralising… the more you think about it, the angrier you get,"" he says.

Investment or right?

In 2023, the national conversation shifted from how expensive it is to buy a home, to how difficult it is to secure any kind of affordable home at all.

An end to pandemic-era rent and eviction freezes, record migration, rapidly escalating interest rates and construction delays conspired to leave housing in Australia in the worst state it has ever been, experts warn.

But the crisis is the result of ""50 years of government policy failure, financialisation and greed"", wrote leading finance journalist Alan Kohler in a recent Quarterly Essay.

Particularly critical was what happened at the turn of the millennium, he argues. Until that point house prices in Australia had kept pace with income growth and the size of the economy - but this began to shift when the federal government introduced tax changes which incentivised the buying and selling of homes for profit.

A sharp spike in immigration and government grants pushed up house prices in that era too, but Mr Kohler says it was these tax breaks that forever changed the way Australia thinks about housing.

""It will be impossible to return the price of housing to something less destructive... without purging the idea that housing is a means to create wealth as opposed to simply a place to live,"" he wrote.

Doing so will upset a large class of voters, which will take courage and innovation from policymakers, he adds.

And that's something critics say successive governments at federal, state and local levels have struggled to muster.

Some point to decades of neglect for social housing, or the persistence with grants for first homebuyers, which are popular but don't work as they should and actually drive up prices further.

Others argue planning and heritage laws have been too easily abused to limit developments, often by existing residents reluctant to see changes to their suburbs and investments.

Then there's the fear of overhauling those lucrative tax incentives for property investors - with the most recent promise of reform rejected at an election in 2019 and now abandoned.

""Housing needs to be seen as an essential service and right before an investment,"" Mr Dowswell says. ""There is definitely a moral imperative to act… [but] selfishness will get in the way.""

Getty Images

People have rallied in cities across the country

National Housing Minister Julie Collins told the BBC there are ""challenges"" to tackle, but that her government - elected 18 months ago - is delivering ""the most significant housing reforms in a generation"".

It has created or expanded schemes to help prospective buyers, though they have strict requirements and limited places. It has also promised to build thousands of new social and affordable houses - a small dent in the waiting list - and set up an investment fund to support future projects. Alongside state governments, it has pledged to create a National Housing and Homelessness Plan and beef up protections for renters.

The government is pulling other levers too: it announced earlier this month that it would halve Australia's immigration intake and triple the fees for foreign homebuyers, both things they argue should help ease the strain.

Advocates support these changes but say they are just more tinkering around the edges of a system that needs heavy reform.

Those the BBC spoke to say that the Australian Dream has been demolished, eroding the foundations of the nation's identity.

Australia has long thought itself the land of a fair go.

""[But] education and hard work are no longer the main determinants of how wealthy you are; now it comes down to where you live and what sort of house you inherit from your parents,"" Mr Kohler says.

""It means Australia is less of an egalitarian meritocracy.""","It's a far cry from the promise of the Great Australian Dream.
""The Australian Dream… it's a big lie,"" Mr Dowswell says.
""The only thing that could make it worse is if banks started collapsing,"" the head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute tells the BBC.

By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Taiwan

Campaigning is in full swing for Taiwan's presidential election on 13 January

The December sun is baking on the Heng Chun peninsula, the tongue of land that juts out from the bottom end of Taiwan into the Philippine Sea.

A half-smoked cigarette pokes from the corner of Hsu Keng-Jui's mouth. He is part of a network of volunteers - most of them veterans like him - who track the now-constant presence of Chinese ships and aircraft just outside Taiwan's territorial limit.

Using plastic zip ties, Mr Hsu straps a long radio antenna to a steel railing, then sits down with his portable radios and begins to scan the military channels. At first all we hear is the soft southern lilt of the Taiwan coastguard directing sea traffic. Then a different accent and a different tone comes through the heavy static. It's the Chinese navy.

China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province. With just weeks to go, Beijing looms larger than ever before - on the ballot, and at Taiwan's borders.

""We represent all the people of China,"" the voice from the Chinese navy intones. ""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""

Dragging on another cigarette, Mr Hsu looks unmoved: ""I hear it every day now. It's like they're reading from a script.""

Another voice comes across the airwaves. It's the captain of a Chinese tugboat, just three miles off Taiwan's coast.

The captain has been asked to move out of Taiwan's territorial waters, but he refuses: ""What territorial waters are you talking about? Taiwan doesn't have any territorial waters!""

Mr Hsu is suddenly furious. He leaps up, grabs a handset and lets loose a stream of invective over the airwaves. He swears as he sits back down, muttering, ""Who does he think he is?""

Hsu Keng-Jui is a veteran who volunteers to track Chinese military intrusion into Taiwan's territory

For decades the governments in Beijing and Taipei had an unwritten agreement not to stray across a median line that divides the 110-mile-wide strait between them.

Now China is crossing it almost daily, at sea and in the air.

On one day in September the People's Liberation Army sent more than a 100 aircraft towards Taiwan, 40 of which crossed the median line.

This so-called ""grey zone warfare"" is meant to ""subdue the enemy without fighting"" to borrow the words of a legendary Chinese military strategist. In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.

""China is sending a very strong message to the United States and even Japan,"" says retired Admiral Lee Hsi-min, a former commander of Taiwan's armed forces. ""It's telling them that Taiwan is part of China. That this is our area so we can do whatever we want here. Meanwhile it's aimed at making Taiwanese people scared and making them capitulate.""

With Taiwan due to elect a new president on 13 January, the key objective is to undermine support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The island's current president Tsai Ing-wen is stepping down after eight years in power.

Beijing on the ballot - again

President Tsai, who has been candid yet deft in her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty, is deeply disliked by Beijing. But the man running to replace her, current vice-president William Lai, is far worse in their eyes. Despite saying he will do nothing to change the status quo, Mr Lai is seen by China as a hardline ""splittist"", an advocate of formal Taiwan independence.

Beijing's message to voters in Taiwan is that a vote for William Lai is a vote for war. It's also the message from the main opposition party, the nationalist Kuomintang or KMT. Their candidate Hou Yu-ih told supporters at a recent rally: ""Our whole generation will lose everything we have fought for during our lifetime [if Lai wins].""

But DPP supporters don't seem cowed. They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.

On a recent drizzly Sunday afternoon, around 60,000 DPP supporters crowded into a square in downtown Taipei to see Mr Lai and his running mate speak.

Then President Tsai stepped onto stage and the crowd came alive cheering and waving little, green DPP flags. Dotted among them were many rainbow flags of gay pride. Ms Tsai is adored by the LGBT community here for making Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.

Democratic elections aside, this is yet another thing that sets Taiwan apart from China. And it is one of many reasons DPP supporters are adamant this island will never be part of the People's Republic of China.

""I am very worried [about the threats from China], but I am not afraid,"" said Frederika Chou. ""Because I will volunteer to be a soldier and fight if they ever try to invade our beautiful country.""

""Some day we may have war, but I'm not afraid because I am Taiwanese, and I need to protect my country,"" said 27-year-old Abby Ding who'd come to the rally with her father all the way from Tainan in the south.

Beijing is far from the only issue on the ballot. Rising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate Ko Wen-je.

Once a DPP supporter, Mr Ko now positions himself as a middle-of-the road option between his main rivals - and one who can broker better ties with Beijing. While ""reunification"" was always a possibility, China's claims have now turned more urgent, especially with its leader Xi Jinping's repeated vows to take the island, with a deadline to boot.

The issue of how much Taiwan should prepare to fight divides the island's main parties. The current DPP government has invested heavily in new, domestically-built submarines and bought scores more F16 fighter jets and modern missiles from the US. It has reinstated 12-month-long compulsory military service and says it will do more if re-elected.

Supporters at a recent rally for KMT, which is campaigning on a promise to secure peace with Beijing

The KMT is much more ambivalent. Its candidate for vice-president, Jaw Shaw Kong, has labelled the submarine building programme a vanity project and a huge waste of money. Mr Jaw's family is from China, and he has long been seen as one of the most Beijing-friendly voices in Taiwan politics.

He says the only way to secure peace for Taiwan is to talk to Beijing, to reassure Mr Xi that Taiwan is not intent on independence, and that one day Taiwan and China can and should be united.

This is far from an unpopular opinion in Taiwan. The island's links to China, from family ties to trade, run deep and are tangled with complicated questions about the past and identity. It's an issue that often pits an older generation with stronger ties to the mainland, against young people who have grown up in a democratic, open society.

No-one will deny the military threat from China but they are divided over how best to deter it.

While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure.

Early one morning in December a group of Mirage 2000 fighter jets scrambled from their base on the west coast and roared out in to the Taiwan straits. The base is home to the 45 jets of Taiwan's rapid reaction squadron, tasked with confronting those Chinese aircraft daily probing the edge of Taiwan's airspace.

The jets were bought from France in the early 1990s and are now getting old. China is wearing down the Taiwanese air force, says retired admiral Lee. And they can feel the impact because maintenance has increased and ""it is actually affecting our capability"", he adds.

China can afford to fly as often as it likes. The People's Liberation Army has more than 2,000 fighter jets and is building many more. Taiwan has fewer than 300, many of them now over a quarter of a century old.

Military experts say that the wear and tear on the Mirage fleet is so high and the cost of fixing them so prohibitive that they've quietly stopped scrambling to intercept all but the most threatening of Chinese intrusions.

Taiwan's Mirage 2000 fighter jets are old - and they are being exhausted by Chinese incursions

The long game

The latest polling data suggest Mr Lai and the DPP are heading for victory in January albeit by a small margin. For the DPP it would be an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term, and a slap in the face for Beijing.

But the DPP will probably get less than 40% of the vote. That means there is still plenty to play for. Taiwan has a free press and an open internet. So the door is wide open for China's propaganda apparatus to target the 60% of voters who won't vote for the DPP. They will also be voting in a new legislature, which the KMT could win.

For years the main target of Chinese propaganda has been Taiwan's older population, particularly those with family ties to the mainland, people who have traditionally voted for the KMT.

""It's been very effective,"" says Puma Shen, an academic and political activist who has spent years studying Chinese influence operations around the world.

""If you look back in history, supporters of the KMT used to be very anti-Chinese Communist Party. But now they have become anti-Taiwan independence. They now believe people who support Taiwan independence are the ones who could trigger a war.""

A group of voters who used to think of the Chinese Communist Party as the enemy, now think the DPP is the real danger. It's not a rare view in Taiwan. Older Taipei residents speak disparagingly of President Tsai and her party as a ""bunch of troublemakers"".

But Beijing knows the key to success will be winning over young voters, those who have no party affiliation and are dissatisfied with both the old traditional parties. They are now being targeted through TikTok and YouTube. China has over 200 channels that are uploading videos daily.

""They are very good at finding out what young Taiwanese are interested in and then creating content to attract them,"" Mr Shen says. It's what he calls ""paving the road"". Once an audience is established and trust develops, pro-China messaging is then introduced.

Mr Shen's research has shown an increase in groups of young Taiwanese who are not pro-China, but have become increasingly anti-US and anti-Japan. Such influence operations are unlikely to yield any sudden embrace of China. But Beijing is playing the long game.","China has been ramping up the pressure ahead of a pivotal presidential race in Taiwan, an island it has long seen as a renegade province.
""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.""
In this case the enemy is Taiwan's government, those who support Taiwan's permanent separation from China, and its foreign allies in the United States and Japan.
They have seen this movie before, and every four years since Taiwan's first presidential election in 1996.
While the main parties squabble, Taiwan's air force is being slowly and steadily exhausted by the constant Chinese pressure."

https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/67356057,Sushi with Schumacher: Ex-F1 chef on catering for sport's big names,['Author not found'],"Former F1 chef Dave Freeman pours champagne over Jenson Button following his World Championship win in 2009

Any chef will tell you it is an extremely stressful job, so imagine catering for some of the biggest names in sport and taking your kitchen to a different country nearly every week.

For about 20 years, that was the life of Dave Freeman, an ex-Formula 1 chef who now owns a golf course in Norfolk.

During his distinguished career, he looked after the culinary needs of some of the world's top drivers, working for Tyrrell, Jordan, BAR, Force India, Brawn, McLaren, Red Bull and Toro Rosso.

Dave, 59, served for 13 years in the Army - good training, he says, ""because you've got to think on your feet"".

But promotion took him away from his job as a general chef, and by around 1997 he was no longer enjoying Army life.

""My brother's friend catered for the Williams-Renault factory so he needed chefs to come and help,"" he remembers.

Dave Freeman is now dealing with drivers of a different kind as a golf course owner

That catering company ended up working with Honda and saw Dave plying his trade in Japan for a year.

""It was a lot of fun and the Japanese people were fabulous to work with,"" says Dave, who was born in Harlow, Essex, but grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

""There's a great little story. We were leaving the Suzuka Grand Prix. In those days, we'd give away our team kit and one of the mechanics threw his jacket out of the window and this fan was so happy and put this jacket on.

""As we were edging out of the circuit, this guy ran round the front and was stopping the bus, jumping and screaming, and he wouldn't move.

""Eventually the bus driver opened up the bus and in he came and gave the mechanic his Rolex watch which had been left in his jacket pocket. I'm not so sure that would happen in other countries.""

Like most aspects of the sport, the hospitality part of F1 has come on leaps and bounds since Dave started in the late 1990s.

""We've gone from cooking in the garage to £20m motorhomes,"" he says.

""When I first started... you'd take a little cooker, some cutlery, you'd have to hire chairs, tables and everything... it was like camping, really.

""Brake dust always looks like pepper and the smell of the brakes was like you were burning stuff.""

Dave remembers an actual fire in Brazil, but F1 catering was changing.

""It became a lot more corporate: more professional-looking, proper counters, bannering and proper equipment.""

Rubens Barrichello was a fan of Dave's Japanese food

Having spent time in Japan, Dave's speciality of sushi made him popular with some of the grid's biggest names.

""A lot of them quite liked Japanese food: Juan Pablo Montoya - he had California rolls - Jenson [Button], Rubens [Barrichello]. I remember doing it for seven drivers and you're basically taking a little bit of a risk on the liability side.

""Imagine the headline: 'Honda chef poisons front five on the grid'.""

One driver in particular took a liking to Dave and his sushi: seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.

""Even though he was nothing to do with Honda, he liked Japanese food, so his physio, Balbir Singh, used to come down and get him a plate of sushi after qualifying, and this used to happen everywhere,"" he remembers.

""I bought this really nice black Japanese plate just for Michael to make it extra special. This one time, unfortunately when his mother died, we were in San Marino.

""He had the food on the Saturday and he flew back to be with her, and then he came back the next day and won the race.

""I never got my plate back, so the following race I said to Balbir, 'Where's my plate?'

""He said, 'Oh, Michael took it on the plane - he's got it in his house now' and I said jokingly 'Oh, that's nice, it cost me a hundred quid!' Five minutes later, a marketing guy comes running up with a chequebook.

""A while after, I saw Michael in Monaco and I said 'Where's my plate, you thief!' and we had a really good laugh over it.""

Dave's sushi was a hit with the drivers, particularly Michael Schumacher

Dave has fond memories of Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013 and has not been seen in public since.

""Michael was really, really great. In Japan, it was the last race, it was the year it was down to Williams against Ferrari and whoever won, won the championship, so it was really tense,"" he says.

""Balbir came to the motorhome and said 'Michael wants a picture' - this is 'Michael Schumacher wants a picture', not the other way around!

""I went into the Ferrari garage dressed in my Williams gear and Michael came over and said, 'Dave, I just wanted to say thank you very much. I'd like a picture.' I've got it framed, obviously, and got him to sign it 'To my sushi.'""

Dave agreed to a photo with seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher

Cooking was not the only role Dave was tasked with during his time in F1.

With teams operating skeleton crews to keep costs low, he was sometimes be entrusted to hold the pit boards delivering information to the drivers.

""I used to do the pit board with Brawn because they didn't have anyone to do it. I used to do a couple of sneaky messages and eventually I asked 'Will you marry me?' to my wife on the pit board, but Rubens and Jenson didn't win so I ran over to the pit wall at Red Bull.

""They saw what I was doing and allowed me on their wall. It was in front of two billion people so she was pressured into it!""

Dave proposed using a pit board as Sebastian Vettel won the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

These days, Dave is no longer misusing pit boards or feeding maki rolls to the fastest drivers in the world.

Last year, along with his wife, Fatna, he bought Middleton Hall Golf Club in Norfolk, and did not miss the opportunity to drop in some F1 references.

""Because of my background, we renamed all the holes after drivers, so we've got Alonso, Schumacher, Verstappen, Hill - where we've actually got a hill on the course - Fittipaldi. Halfway house is now the Pit-Stop; the first tee is Lights Out.""

A scorecard with a difference at Dave's Middleton Hall course

One seemingly glaring omission is George Russell, the Mercedes driver, born just four miles away in King's Lynn. But there is a good reason, according to Dave: ""He's not a world champion yet!""

So if Russell does need any extra motivation to kick on and overthrow the seemingly unbeatable Max Verstappen, a hole named after him on a golf course in his home county is on the line.

Dave was speaking to BBC Radio Norfolk's Racing Torque show.","For about 20 years, that was the life of Dave Freeman, an ex-Formula 1 chef who now owns a golf course in Norfolk.

By Geeta Pandey BBC News, Delhi

Isro

Vikram lander, with Pragyaan rover in its belly, landed on the far side of the Moon in August

In India, 2023 will be remembered as the year we went to the Moon.

On 23 August, massive celebrations broke out across the country when Chandrayaan-3 touched down in the lunar south pole region - an area on the Moon's surface that no-one had reached before.

With this, India also joined an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.

In the following months, India continued its stride into space - by sending an observation mission to the Sun and then by carrying out a key test flight ahead of its planned mission to take astronauts into space in 2025.

We look back at an eventful year when India's strides into space made global headlines.

To the Moon

It was ""20 minutes of terror"" for scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) as the Vikram lander, carrying the Pragyaan rover in its belly, began its descent to the Moon's surface.

The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing in the south pole region where the surface is ""very uneven"" and ""full of craters and boulders"".

""India is on the Moon,"" a triumphant Isro chief S Somanath announced - and with that the country entered the history books.

Over the next 10 days, space scientists - and the rest of the country - followed every move made by the lander and the rover as they gathered data and images and relayed them back to Earth for analysis.

Isro

Isro released a graphic of the path taken by the lunar rover

So we saw images of the six-wheeled rover sliding down from the lander's belly and taking its first steps on the lunar soil. Moving at a speed of 1cm per second, it ""traversed over 100m [328 feet]"" and at times re-routed to avoid falling into craters.

Some of their findings that show a sharp difference in temperatures just above and below the lunar surface and confirmed presence of a host of chemicals, especially sulphur, in the soil have enthused space scientists and the scientific community at large.

A proud Isro said the mission had not just completed its goals but also exceeded them.

One of the highlights, Isro said, was Vikram's ""hop experiment"". The agency said that when the lander was ""commanded to fire its engines, it rose up by about 40cm [16 inches] and landed at a distance of 30-40cm"". This ""successful experiment"" means the spacecraft could be used in future to bring samples back to the Earth or for human missions, it added.

And earlier this month Isro said it had successfully brought back into Earth's orbit a part of the rocket that carried Chandrayaan-3 to Moon.

The ""propulsion module"", which had detached from the Vikram lander after ferrying it close to the Moon, had re-entered Earth's orbit after a series of complex manoeuvres.

Together, the hop experiment and the return of the propulsion module to Earth's orbit are crucial for Isro's future plans to bring back samples or return astronauts from Space.

Looking at the Sun

Just days after the Moon landing, India launched Aditya-L1 - its first observation mission to the Sun.

The rocket that took off on 2 September is on a four-month 1.5 million km (932,000 miles)-journey from the Earth and is expected to reach its destination next week.

That destination - called L1 or Lagrange point 1 - is at 1% of the Earth-Sun distance. It's the exact spot between where the gravitational forces of two large objects, such as the Sun and the Earth, cancel each other out, allowing a spacecraft to ""hover"".

Once Aditya - named after the Hindu god of Sun - reaches this ""parking spot"", it would be able to orbit the Sun at the same rate as the Earth. From this vantage point, it will keep an eye on the Sun 24X7 and carry out scientific studies.

The orbiter is carrying seven scientific instruments that will observe and study the solar corona (the outermost layer); the photosphere (the Sun's surface or the part we see from the Earth) and the chromosphere (a thin layer of plasma that lies between the photosphere and the corona).

Isro says the studies will help scientists understand solar activity, such as the solar wind and solar flares, and their effect on Earth and space weather in real time.

The agency has already shared some of the scientific data collected by the orbiter - and images taken by its camera have been watched millions of times on X (formerly Twitter).

Can we return from space?

That's the key question that India's space agency tried to answer when it launched the Gaganyaan spacecraft on 21 October, the first in a series of test flights ahead of its planned mission to take astronauts into space in 2025.

India has said it plans to place three astronauts into low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 400km for three days and the Isro chief has said Gaganyaan is their ""immediate priority"".

""Send an Indian to space and bring them back safely - this is our immediate big-ticket target,"" Mr Somanath said.

Isro

Gaganyaan's crew escape module was fished out from the Bay of Bengal by Indian navy divers

The test flight in October was to demonstrate whether the crew can safely escape the rocket in case it malfunctions.

So, once the rocket had travelled about 12km in the sky, its abort systems were activated and a series of parachutes were deployed which brought it down safely in the waters of Bay of Bengal from where it was fished out by Indian navy divers.

Since the test was successful, Isro has said it will first send a female humanoid - a robot that resembles a human - in an unmanned Gaganyaan spacecraft before finally sending astronauts into space.

Doctors and Men Up's cast hope the show can help end the stigma.

Experts say impotence awareness needs a champion like how Davina McCall has helped women with the menopause.

Erectile dysfunction can affect about half of men over 40, according to the NHS.

But men are warned the condition might be a sign of more deep-rooted health problems so should ""use their penis as a health barometer"" and see a doctor as soon as possible.

""As men, we're not particularly great at talking about our feelings or issues of this kind,"" said Men Up and Game of Thrones star Iwan Rheon.

Iwan Rheon feels Men Up is ""an important story to be told"" as it affects a lot of people's lives - and not just men

""There's a lot of emphasis on men's mental health and it's really important this story is being told now.""

Men Up is a feature-length BBC drama about five ordinary guys who take part in a new impotence drug trial.

""It was extremely brave of these men to open themselves up for a trial like this,"" said Dunkirk actor Aneurin Barnard, who plays pioneering consultant Dr Dylan Pearce in Men Up.

""Especially in society at this point in time where men held their cards very close to their chest and any mention of sexual dysfunctional or impotence was no-no.

""But they were all seeking to find something they'd lost - that's the powerful thing.

""It's about normal people trying to gain back their manhood, their confidence as it was like having their mojo taken away from you - and that caused huge problems within their relationships.""

Even though erectile disfunction is a common condition among older men, patients are reluctant to talk about their problems - even with medical experts - and that can could risk the health further.

So with half over 40 likely to have erectile dysfunction at some stage, doctors have joined Men Up's star-studded cast and urged men to open up for the benefit of their health - and their relationships.

""It's very hard for men to realise it isn't about being less of a man if you have erectile dysfunction,"" said leading men's health expert Dr Jeff Foster.

""There could be real medical reasons as 90% of cases have a biological cause, like diabetes, heart disease or low testosterone. That completely dismisses the idea it's just in your head.

""It isn't just a case of buying a Viagra and it'll be fine, that deals with the symptom and not the cause.

""Men need to think of their penis like a barometer of your health and if it's not working, you need to see a doctor and say I've got a medical problem.""

Dr Jeff Foster

Dr Jeff Foster said many of his erectile dysfunction patients delay seeing him hoping the issue will go away

Dr Foster runs a specialist sexual dysfunction clinic in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and, on average, his 1,000 erectile dysfunction patients took three years to see him.

""Erectile dysfunction and issues around sexual function in men are an enormously stigmatised in the UK,"" added Dr Foster, a member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.

""If you had most medical conditions, you probably wouldn't wait three years before you go to see a doctor. If you leave it, relationships suffer and the risk of underlying more serious medical conditions gets worse.""

TV presenter Davina McCall has campaigned to increase awareness of the menopause and its affect on women and now there are calls for an equivalent male champion for erectile dysfunction to help end the stigma.

""Like what Davina McCall has done for women and the menopause, I can't tell you how much I we had a super-famous man to do that for erectile dysfunction and normalise it because it's a very normal condition,"" said andrology specialist Dr Janine David.

Dr Foster agrees, adding: ""It'll take a brave bloke to say I've got a erectile dysfunction but it won't take much for one or two others who are gutsy enough in to say 'yeah, I've had this problem too' and for attitudes to start to change.

""This Men Up drama is really good because even if it doesn't change a population attitude, it will get men thinking - and maybe a couple will go and see their doctor if something is not quite right.""

Five ordinary Welshmen face up to their secrets and lies when they embark on one of the world's first medical trials for the drug that would become Viagra.

Catch Men Up on BBC iPlayer and on BBC One on Friday at 21:00 GMT.

Dr David set up and became medical director of Men's Health Wales to help improve the health of patients in an area she feels is ""often overlooked"".

""Men with erectile dysfunction and diabetes must have a testosterone blood test to rule out it being low because half will have low testosterone,"" said Dr David, secretary of the British Society for Sexual Medicine.

""Testosterone deficiency needs to be checked as it can make men feel depressed, which can cause erectile dysfunction which can, in turn, make them more depressed so its a vicious cycle.

Dr Janine David

Dr Janine David has undertaken clinical research and had papers published in journals about erectile dysfunction

""Erections will not improve without testosterone replacement but also having low testosterone and diabetes doubles your mortality rate so that check is really important.""

It is hoped the drama can help transform the ""sniggering behind closed doors"" taboo attitude to men who cannot get an erection.

""Men's mental health and opening up is the heart of Men Up,"" said Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Gangs of London star Mark Lewis Jones, who plays macho Eddie O'Connor in the drama.

""We've made a bit of progress but we've still a long way to go - and I count myself within that as well as I find it difficult to talk about feelings and identifying them.

""We hope people take away from it that these men's lives changed as a result of an experience they shared.""

Men Up is based on a medical trial in Swansea in 1994 for the pill then known as Sildenafil UK-92,480 by pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and included men with diabetes and heart disease, where erectile dysfunction is a common side effect.

After the study at Morriston Hospital, Viagra went on to become one of the most controversial, profitable and well-known drugs in history that has been used by millions of men across the world.

BBC / Quay Street Productions / Tom Jackson

Welsh actress Joanna Page said she and many of the Welsh cast never knew such a significant Viagra trial happened in Wales

""The story of the men is utterly heart-breaking, it's such a terrible time in their lives and affects their relationships, their mood and their whole family,"" said Gavin and Stacey star Joanna Page, who plays nurse Moira Davies.

Phaldut Sharma, who plays married accountant Pete Shah, said Men Up's humour was a ""wonderful"" and important part for men to engagement in such a serious subject.

""It uses a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down using the comedy to address the issue. Getting men to laugh is probably a good way into it,"" said the former EastEnders actor.

What causes erectile dysfunction?

Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection and this is usually caused by stress, tiredness, drinking too much alcohol or a side effect of some medicine - and is nothing to worry about.

If erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, diabetes, depression or anxiety or hormone problems.

Healthy lifestyle changes, losing weight if you're overweight, eating a healthy diet, exercising daily, stopping smoking and reducing stress can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction.","Health: Can BBC show help men talk about erectile dysfunction?

Rhondda is swapped in for 'Wanda' on this chip shop to play on the 1988 film starring John Cleese

If you're partial to a bag of chips, the chances are you've visited a chip shop with a pun-based name.

From London's relatively straight-forward The Codfather to the more elaborately-named A Fish Called Rhondda in Pentre, Rhondda Cynon Taf, chip shop owners can't resist a play on words.

Others in on the act include London barbers Barber Streisand, Sunderland wine shop Amy's Winehouse and pottery cafe Kilning Me Softly in Milton Keynes.

Florist Rachael Allen owns the flamboyantly-named Dark Side of the Bloom just outside Bangor in Gwynedd, north Wales.

She said naming her business after the Pink Floyd song Dark Side of the Moon turned out to be a shrewd business decision.

""It just took off, we get so many comments, it's unbelievable,"" she said.

Dark Side of the Bloom / Instagram

Rachael Allen (right) wanted the name of her florist to reflect the alternative weddings they work on

""I wanted something that reflected a little bit of an alternative florist rather than just the run of the mill because we do a lot of alternative weddings.

""The dark side represented the black and the funeral work and the bloom was obviously flowers.""

Although she would not consider herself to be a Pink Floyd fan, the name seems to attract people who are.

""I do get a lot of bikers and I've done a lot of bikers' funerals and weddings as well and I think [the name] has attracted them so its really good,"" she said.

Dark Side of the Bloom / Instagram

Naming her shop Dark Side of the Bloom has been good for business, says Rachael

Rachel's business has been shortlisted for a competition aiming to find the shop name with the best - or worst, depending on your preference - use of a pun.

A list of what will be to some hilarious and to others groan-inducing names has been put together by language learning platform Babbel, which has analysed TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Facebook to find the 120 most popular.

A public poll will decide an overall winner who will be named in the new year.

Damsel in this dress

Kathryn Robson said having a memorable name did not make much of a difference to her business

Also shortlisted is fellow north Wales business owner Kathryn Robson with her shop named Damsel In This Dress.

""The shop at the time was next door to the castle and the building that the shop was in used to be an armoury so we wanted it to be something to do with women and castles,"" she explained.

But she does not attribute the success of her shop in Harlech, Gwynedd, to the memorable name.

""It's fun to have a fun name... but I'm not sure it makes a difference to our business other than that the staff and locals find it fun,"" she said.

In fact, she has changed the name of the business' Facebook page to Wool & Gifts Harlech after finding people searching online were more likely to use the location of the shop than the name.

What is it about shopkeepers and puns?

""The pun undeniably holds a special place in British hearts,"" said Babbel's linguistic and cultural expert Noel Wolf.

""The beauty of a pun lies in its ability to exploit the versatile vocabulary and multiplicity of meanings of English - the prevalence of the pun in Britain is testament to the flexibility and richness of the English language.""

By Tom Gerken Technology reporter

US news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

The lawsuit, which also names Microsoft as a defendant, says the firms should be held responsible for ""billions of dollars"" in damages.

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) ""learn"" by analysing a massive amount of data often sourced online.

The BBC has approached OpenAI and Microsoft for comment.

The lawsuit claims ""millions"" of articles published by the New York Times were used without its permission to make ChatGPT smarter, and claims the tool is now competing with the newspaper as a trustworthy information source.

It alleges that when asked about current events, ChatGPT will sometimes generate ""verbatim excerpts"" from New York Times articles, which cannot be accessed without paying for a subscription.

According to the lawsuit, this means readers can get New York Times content without paying for it - meaning it is losing out on subscription revenue as well as advertising clicks from people visiting the website.

It also gave the example of the Bing search engine - which has some features powered by ChatGPT - producing results taken from a New York Times-owned website, without linking to the article or including referral links it uses to generate income.

Watch: Expert: AI ‘hurts ability to keep democracy alive’

Microsoft has invested more than $10 billion (£7.8 billion) in OpenAI.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court, reveals the New York Times unsuccessfully approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to seek ""an amicable resolution"" over its copyright.

Multiple lawsuits

It comes a month after a period of chaos at OpenAI where co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was sacked - and then rehired - over the course of a few days.

His sacking shocked industry insiders and led to staff threatening mass resignations unless he was reinstated.

But as well as the internal issues, the firm is now facing multiple lawsuits filed in 2023.

In September a similar copyright infringement case was brought by a group of US authors including Game of Thrones novelist George RR Martin and John Grisham.

That followed legal action brought by comedian Sarah Silverman in July, as well as an open letter signed by authors Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman that same month calling for AI companies to compensate them for using their work.

And OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit alongside Microsoft - and programming site GitHub - from a group of computing experts who argue their code was used without their permission to train an AI called Copilot.

As well as these actions, there have been many cases brought against developers of so-called generative AI - that is, artificial intelligence that can create media based on text prompts - with artists suing text-to-image generators Stability AI and Midjourney in January, claiming they only function by being trained on copyrighted artwork.","New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI for ‘billions’By Tom Gerken Technology reporterGetty ImagesUS news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

By Nomsa Maseko BBC News, Johannesburg

Mbongeni Ngema's works reflected the ""spirit of resistance"" against white-minority rule, his family said

Tributes are being paid to the South African playwright Mbongeni Ngema after he died in a car crash aged 68.

He rose to international prominence in the 1980s with plays that depicted the lives of black people under the racist system of apartheid.

His works ""reflected the spirit of resistance"" during white minority rule, his family said.

Ngema was best-known for his musical Sarafina!, which was later adapted into a film starring Whoopi Goldberg.

President Cyril Ramaphosa led tributes to the playwright, composer and theatrical director.

Ngema's ""masterfully creative narration of our liberation struggle honoured the humanity of oppressed South Africans"" and ""exposed the inhumanity"" of the apartheid regime, the South African leader said.

He died in a head-on collision on Wednesday evening while returning from a funeral in the town of Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape province.

More than 700 people have been killed in car accidents in South Africa since the beginning of December.

Born in 1955, Ngema began his career as a backing guitarist before taking to the stage in local theatre productions in the 1970s,.

He went on to co-write the 1981 play Woza Albert! (meaning Rise Up Albert! in Zulu), which imagines the second coming of Jesus Christ during the apartheid era.

The satirical work became the benchmark of South African protest theatre at home and on the stages of London and New York.

He followed up with the musical Asinimali! (Zulu for We don't have money!), which showed off his exceptional technical abilities as a producer.

And then came his 1987 triumph Sarafina!, set during the Soweto Uprising and carrying to audiences worldwide the revolutionary ardour of South Africa's youth. It was adapted into a blockbuster movie in 1992.

South African actress Sophie Ndaba said that Ngema would be remembered for generations to come.

""Thank you for inspiring us with your creative work and music,"" she said in a her tribute posted on Instagram.

Some of Ngema's plays after apartheid, which ended in 1994, courted controversy.

He produced Sarafina 2 in 1995 to raise awareness about the scourge of HIV/Aids, which had largely been ignored during apartheid.

It was commissioned by the new government at a cost of 14m rand ($750,000; £590,000) - an amount seen as exorbitant and which triggered an investigation by South Africa's anti-corruption watchdog, the public protector.

The probe found that the health department's funding for the play was an ""unauthorised expenditure"" and its message about HIV/Aids was inadequate.

Ngema also found himself at the centre of controversy in 2002 with his song AmaNdiya (meaning Indians in Zulu), which accused South Africa's Indian community of racism and exploitation.

It was banned from the airwaves by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa, which said that it incited hatred.

Anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, who served as South Africa's first democratically elected president from 1994-1999, urged Ngema to apologise.

By James Gregory BBC News

AFP

Fighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border earlier this week

Israel will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned.

Benny Gantz said the Israeli military would intervene if militants do not stop firing on northern Israel.

Time for a diplomatic solution was running out, he added.

Meanwhile, the head of the Israel Defense Forces said troops were in ""very high readiness"" for more fighting in the north.

""Our first task is to restore security and the sense of security to the residents in the north, and this will take time,"" Chief of the General Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said, after conducting a ""situational assessment"".

Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel.

On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched its highest number of cross-border attacks in a day since 8 October, security sources told Reuters.

It has led to concerns the conflict in Gaza could become wider across the region.

""The situation on Israel's northern border demands change,"" Mr Gantz told a news conference on Wednesday night.

""The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it.""

But the Lebanese ambassador in the UK, Rami Mortada, said his country was on the receiving end of attacks and ""the party that should hold back is Israel"".

""We are not interested in escalation - all sides need to de-escalate,"" he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on a visit to troops near the border that Israel would ""single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis"" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.

Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim organisation - is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.

Funded by Iran, it is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world.

In 2006, a full-blown war between Hezbollah and Israel was triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid, with Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon.

At the border, there has been an increase in rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah this week, with Israeli war planes quick to respond.

On Thursday, Israeli forces said they intercepted a drone crossing into their territory from Lebanon.

And on Wednesday, state media in Lebanon reported that a Hezbollah fighter and two of his relatives had been killed in an Israeli air strike.

The attack reportedly hit a house in Bint Jbeil, a town about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel.

A Hezbollah statement said one of the victims, Ibrahim Bazzi, was an Australian citizen visiting his family.

More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon since October - most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists, are also among the dead.

On the Israeli side, at least four civilians and nine soldiers are known to have died on the Lebanon border since hostilities began. Thousands of civilians living in dozens of communities in the area have been evacuated by the army.

Meanwhile, Unifil - the UN peacekeeping force that has operated in southern Lebanon since 1978 - called on Lebanese authorities to investigate after one of its troops was wounded in the country's south.

Unifil said a patrol was attacked ""by a group of young men"" in Taybeh, with a vehicle also damaged.

Hezbollah's leadership praised the unprecedented cross-border attack launched by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others were taken hostage.

More than 21,100 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","Israel Gaza war: Israel warns Hezbollah and Lebanon over border fightingBy James Gregory BBC NewsAFPFighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border earlier this weekIsrael will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned.

Talks are still going on to end checks like these on the Bulgarian border with Greece

Romania and Bulgaria are to join Europe's Schengen border-free zone by air and sea by March, officials from the two countries have announced.

Austria had objected to expanding the zone, fearing more illegal immigration, but later agreed the two Balkan states could enter the zone in stages.

Talks will continue next year on opening land borders.

There are currently 27 countries in the Schengen area, which allows 400 million people to move freely between them.

Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 and have been trying to enter Schengen for more than 10 years.

Their full entry to the zone would leave Ireland and Cyprus as the only EU countries outside it.

Romania's Interior Ministry said in a statement released late on Wednesday that agreement was reached on 23 December.

And Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Facebook: ""After 13 years, finally Romania will join Schengen! We have a political agreement on this!""

Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov also confirmed the deal at a year-end government meeting.

Austrian officials have said only that negotiations are continuing.

Vienna vetoed Schengen's expansion in 2022 but earlier this month relaxed its position, putting forward the idea of ""Air Schengen"" as a precursor to the opening of land borders.

By Max Matza BBC News

Watch: Maine's top election official on why she removed Trump from ballot

Maine's top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Mr Trump was not eligible because of his actions leading up to the US Capitol riot in 2021.

Maine now joins Colorado as the two states to ban Mr Trump from the ballot.

The decisions increase pressure on the Supreme Court to weigh in.

Colorado votes reliably Democratic, however, Maine is more politically competitive and would be more significant for Mr Trump - the Republican frontrunner - to lose.

The 34-page ruling says that Mr Trump must be removed from the Maine ballot because of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution - which bans anyone from holding office that has ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"".

In her order, Mrs Bellows says that Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6, 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"".

She added that his ""occasional requests that rioters be peaceful and support law enforcement do not immunize his actions"".

Speaking with BBC News, Mrs Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the ""Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide"".

""I'm mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment. But I'm also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection.""

Mr Trump's campaign had previously called for Mrs Bellows to recuse herself from the process, and on Thursday swiftly criticised her decision.

Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called Mrs Bellows ""a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat"" and claimed she was engaging in ""election interference"".

He added that the campaign will ""quickly file a legal objection in state court to prevent this atrocious decision in Maine from taking effect"".

Mr Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy has been challenged in multiple states, on the grounds that the 14th Amendment bans him from holding office.

The 14th amendment was ratified after the American Civil War in order to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power after southern states re-joined the Union.

Colorado's ban was the first instance of the Constitution being used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

Watch: Trump says indictments are ""badge of honour"" at campaign event following his removal from Colorado ballot

But legal experts say the Colorado ruling will have a tough time standing up when it reaches the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court.

And state courts in Michigan and Minnesota have also recently dismissed efforts to block Mr Trump from the ballot.

The case to remove him in the New England state was brought by a handful of former Maine lawmakers who argued that the former president had violated his oath of office.

Former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno told BBC News he believed there was ""no way this holds up"".

""It's breathtakingly arrogant for her to unilaterally decide that someone has committed insurrection,"" Moreno said about Mrs Bellows' ruling.

""This will create a political furore… that's the unfortunate outcome here,"" he said, adding he found Maine and Colorado to be ""very shaky legal decisions"".

It all leads to a Supreme Court showdown - which Mr Moreno said should take place ""rapidly"" to stop more states from individually determining Trump's eligibility.

Thursday's ruling is the latest in a growing list of legal woes Mr Trump faces.

He also has upcoming trials in federal court and in the state of Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.","Trump blocked from Maine presidential ballot in 2024By Max Matza BBC NewsWatch: Maine's top election official on why she removed Trump from ballotMaine's top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause.

By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney

The average price of a home in Sydney is over A$1m (£535,000, $678,000)

At the age of 31, Justin Dowswell never imagined he'd be living in a shared room in his childhood home.

He had a full-time, well-paying job in Sydney, and had rented for a decade before an unprecedented housing crisis forced him to upend his life and move back in with his parents, two hours away.

""It's humbling,"" he says. But the alternative was homelessness: ""So I'm one of the lucky ones"".

It's a far cry from the promise of the Great Australian Dream.

Where the American Dream is a more abstract belief that anyone can achieve success if they work hard enough, the Australian version is tangible.

For generations, owning a house on a modest block of land has been idealised as both the ultimate marker of success and a gateway to a better life.

It's an aspiration that has wormed its way into the country's identity, helping to shape modern Australia.

From the so-called ""Ten Pound Poms"" in the 1950s to the current boom in skilled workers moving from India, waves of migrants have arrived on Australia's shores in search of its promise. And many found it.

But for current generations the dreams proffered to their parents and grandparents are out of reach.

After decades of government policies that treat housing as an investment not a right, many say they would be lucky to even find a stable, affordable place to rent.

""The Australian Dream… it's a big lie,"" Mr Dowswell says.

A perfect storm

Almost everything that could go wrong with housing in Australia has gone wrong, says Michael Fotheringham.

""The only thing that could make it worse is if banks started collapsing,"" the head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute tells the BBC.

Underpinning it all is that buying a house is astronomically expensive - the average property now costs about nine times an ordinary household's income, triple what it was 25 years ago.

It's particularly dire for the three quarters of Australians who live in major cities. Sydney, for example, is the second least affordable city on Earth to buy a property, trailing only Hong Kong, according to the 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.

Australia has made home ownership virtually unattainable for almost anyone without family wealth. Last month the boss of a major bank, ANZ, said home loans had become ""the preserve of the rich"".

That's left people like Chelsea Hickman questioning their future. The 28-year-old fashion designer always imagined she'd become both a homeowner and a mother, but now worries that may be impossible.

""Financially, how could I ever afford both? The numbers just do not add up,"" she says.

She tells the BBC from her Melbourne shared house that despite working full-time for almost a decade, she can't even afford to rent an apartment by herself. Her friends are in a similar boat.

""Where did it go wrong?"" she says.

""We did everything that everyone said we should do, and we're still not reaching this point where we're going to have financial independence and housing security.""

Tarek Bieganski, a 26-year-old IT manager, laughs when asked if he thinks he'll ever own property.

""It's just so obviously out of reach that it's not really even a thought anymore,"" he says. ""And this is coming from someone that, really, has got it pretty good.""

But with interest rates rising faster than at any time in Australia's history, even many of those who have scraped their way on to the property ladder now live in fear of falling off it.

Foodbanks are being overwhelmed by mortgage holders struggling to keep their heads above water. Hordes of people are picking up extra jobs. Many pensioners have been forced back into work.

It's not doom and gloom for everyone though.

Many existing homeowners do not want to see house prices stabilise

The level of home ownership across the nation - while significantly dropping for young people - has overall stayed around two-thirds.

And those Australians are quite content to see house prices climb and their wealth grow.

That's difficult to stomach, Ms Hickman says, especially given how many households - one in three - now own a property other than the one they live in.

""I understand that people are like 'Well, I worked hard to get these millions of houses' and blah, blah, blah, and I'm like, 'Okay, well, good for you. I work hard too and I just want one house'.""

'Grapes of Wrath stuff'

As a result, millions of people are trapped in the rental market, seeking to create a watered-down version of the Australian Dream as tenants.

But that's no paradise either.

Vacancies are at unprecedented, prolonged lows - to the point that councils across the country are begging people with empty holiday homes and short-term rentals to move them on to the long-term market.

And, with the greater demand, rents are skyrocketing.

Australian news has been awash with stories of massive rent increases and images of desperate people queuing to inspect properties riddled with defects and - in some cases - obviously covered in mould.

""It's Grapes of Wrath stuff,"" Dr Fotheringham says, referring to the famous Great Depression-era novel about a family struggling to build a life.

Social or subsidised housing - once a safety net for those on low or moderate incomes - is not an option for most Australians either. The number of homes available is less than half of what is needed to meet immediate demand and wait lists are years long.

And all of this is happening at a time when natural disasters and climate effects are wiping out swathes of housing stock, making even more parts of the vast Australian continent effectively unliveable.

The crisis is tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions. Demand for housing support is so high that some charities say they've been handing out tents.

One Tasmanian woman told the BBC she and her four kids spent over six months crammed into her mother's spare room after the family was knocked back for more than 35 properties while languishing on the social housing wait list.

Melbourne woman Hayley Van Ree told us her rental prospects were so bleak that her mother raided her own retirement fund to buy an apartment and is now Ms Van Ree's landlord - eliciting what she describes as a confusing mix of relief, embarrassment and guilt.

""Friends who have parents who are in property have this kind of morbid knowledge that when their parents die, they might be ok,"" Ms Van Ree says. ""I hate that it's my reality.""

Ms Van Ree says she knows plenty of people with ""just fine"" jobs who can't secure a home

Mr Dowswell is now back in Sydney, having finally secured an apartment after six months, but says the ordeal has been a massive tax on his finances and mental health.

""It was just demoralising… the more you think about it, the angrier you get,"" he says.

Investment or right?

In 2023, the national conversation shifted from how expensive it is to buy a home, to how difficult it is to secure any kind of affordable home at all.

An end to pandemic-era rent and eviction freezes, record migration, rapidly escalating interest rates and construction delays conspired to leave housing in Australia in the worst state it has ever been, experts warn.

But the crisis is the result of ""50 years of government policy failure, financialisation and greed"", wrote leading finance journalist Alan Kohler in a recent Quarterly Essay.

Particularly critical was what happened at the turn of the millennium, he argues. Until that point house prices in Australia had kept pace with income growth and the size of the economy - but this began to shift when the federal government introduced tax changes which incentivised the buying and selling of homes for profit.

A sharp spike in immigration and government grants pushed up house prices in that era too, but Mr Kohler says it was these tax breaks that forever changed the way Australia thinks about housing.

""It will be impossible to return the price of housing to something less destructive... without purging the idea that housing is a means to create wealth as opposed to simply a place to live,"" he wrote.

Doing so will upset a large class of voters, which will take courage and innovation from policymakers, he adds.

And that's something critics say successive governments at federal, state and local levels have struggled to muster.

Some point to decades of neglect for social housing, or the persistence with grants for first homebuyers, which are popular but don't work as they should and actually drive up prices further.

Others argue planning and heritage laws have been too easily abused to limit developments, often by existing residents reluctant to see changes to their suburbs and investments.

Then there's the fear of overhauling those lucrative tax incentives for property investors - with the most recent promise of reform rejected at an election in 2019 and now abandoned.

""Housing needs to be seen as an essential service and right before an investment,"" Mr Dowswell says. ""There is definitely a moral imperative to act… [but] selfishness will get in the way.""

Getty Images

People have rallied in cities across the country

National Housing Minister Julie Collins told the BBC there are ""challenges"" to tackle, but that her government - elected 18 months ago - is delivering ""the most significant housing reforms in a generation"".

It has created or expanded schemes to help prospective buyers, though they have strict requirements and limited places. It has also promised to build thousands of new social and affordable houses - a small dent in the waiting list - and set up an investment fund to support future projects. Alongside state governments, it has pledged to create a National Housing and Homelessness Plan and beef up protections for renters.

The government is pulling other levers too: it announced earlier this month that it would halve Australia's immigration intake and triple the fees for foreign homebuyers, both things they argue should help ease the strain.

Advocates support these changes but say they are just more tinkering around the edges of a system that needs heavy reform.

Those the BBC spoke to say that the Australian Dream has been demolished, eroding the foundations of the nation's identity.

Australia has long thought itself the land of a fair go.

""[But] education and hard work are no longer the main determinants of how wealthy you are; now it comes down to where you live and what sort of house you inherit from your parents,"" Mr Kohler says.

""It means Australia is less of an egalitarian meritocracy.""","It's a far cry from the promise of the Great Australian Dream.
""The Australian Dream… it's a big lie,"" Mr Dowswell says.
""The only thing that could make it worse is if banks started collapsing,"" the head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute tells the BBC.

Visitors are required to stay on boardwalks at the Yellowstone's Mammoth Hot Springs

US National Park Service rangers have charged former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan with trespassing in Yellowstone National Park.

Mr Brosnan, 70, was charged with going off trail near the Mammoth Hot Springs and has been ordered to appear in court in Wyoming on 23 January.

The hot springs are part of the park's thermal features that include geysers, steam vents and scalding mud pools.

More than 20 people have been killed after falling into the park's springs.

The Irish actor, who played James Bond from 1995 to 2002, had entered an off-limits area near the Mammoth Terraces on 1 November, according to charging documents obtained by BBC News.

He allegedly left the boardwalk to enter the ecologically sensitive ground.

Mr Brosnan has not commented on the charges.

Leaving the trail can be very dangerous, as the ground is brittle and can easily give way to the boiling hot acid pools beneath, according to the park's website.

In August, a Michigan man sustained thermal burns after leaving the official trail in Yellowstone, the world's oldest national park.

In 2021, a 20-year-old woman suffered severe burns after trying to rescue her dog from a Yellowstone hot spring.

In 2016, a 23-year-old man died in the Lower Geyser Basin after leaving the boardwalk trail with his sister.

Authorities later determined it was too unsafe to recover his body, which had dissolved almost entirely by the following day.

Mr Brosnan - who also starred in the volcano blockbuster Dante's Peak, Mamma Mia, Mrs Doubtfire and The Thomas Crown Affair - had been in the area to film Unholy Trinity.","Pierce Brosnan accused of trespassing in Yellowstone National ParkBy Max Matza BBC NewsGetty ImagesVisitors are required to stay on boardwalks at the Yellowstone's Mammoth Hot SpringsUS National Park Service rangers have charged former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan with trespassing in Yellowstone National Park.

Donald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was made

Donald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The former president made a brief appearance in the 1992 film in a scene filmed at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time.

Director Chris Columbus said Mr Trump insisted on appearing in the film if they used the hotel as a location.

But Mr Trump said the filmmakers were ""begging"" him to appear.

""I was very busy, and didn't want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.

""I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time,"" he said. ""People call me whenever it is aired.""

""If they felt bullied, or didn't want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years?"" Mr Trump added. ""Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that's why!""

The initial comments from Mr Columbus were made in a 2020 interview with Business Insider, although they received renewed attention on social media over Christmas.

The director said Mr Trump sought a cameo appearance in addition to the customary fee to film in the hotel.

""We paid the fee, but he also said 'the only way you can use the Plaza is if I'm in the movie',"" Mr Columbus said. ""So we agreed to put him in the movie.""

He also said people ""cheered"" when Mr Trump was shown in screenings and that it became a ""moment"" for the audience.

But he added that he ""did bully his way into the movie"".

Mr Trump, however, said ""nothing could be further from the truth"".

In the film, protagonist Kevin McCallister - played by Macaulay Culkin - uses his father's credit card to check into the Plaza where Mr Trump helpfully gives him directions to the lobby.

Mr Trump has made dozens of cameo appearances in television series and films including Sex and the City, Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and Two Weeks Notice.","Trump denies bullying his way into Home Alone 2By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, WashingtonAlamyDonald Trump owned the Plaza Hotel in New York at the time the film was madeDonald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

Getty Images

The conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year. The front lines have hardly moved in the last few months but could the course of the war change in 2024?

President Volodomyr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped. Russia still controls about 18% of Ukraine.

We asked three military analysts how they think events may unfold in the coming 12 months.

War will drag on but not indefinitely

Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London

The prospects for an end of the war in Ukraine remain bleak. Compared with this time last year, Vladimir Putin is stronger, politically more than militarily.

The situation on the battleground remains uncertain. Recently, Ukraine's winter offensive seems to have come to a halt. But there is no Russian breakthrough, either. More than ever, the outcome depends on political decisions made miles away from the centre of the conflict - in Washington and in Brussels.

The West's impressive show of unity displayed in 2022, and that endured throughout 2023, is starting to vacillate.

The US defence aid package is held hostage by what President Biden rightly labelled ""petty politics"" in Washington. And the future of the EU's economic aid is seemingly dependent on Hungary's incongruous stance.

Hesitation in the West's capitals has emboldened Putin. His recent public appearances and defiant statements demonstrate that as far as he is concerned, Russia is in this for the long haul.

Getty Images

So, will the West have the strength and stamina to continue to oppose him and all that he represents?

The EU's decision to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova is more than just symbolic. It implicitly means continued backing for Kyiv, as a future in the EU for Ukraine would be impossible with a full-blown victory for Russia.

In Washington, a complete reversal of policy is unlikely.

While it is tempting to depict doomsday scenarios for US assistance as Trump's ratings rise in the polls, the former president, amid all the theatrics, did not walk out from Nato in 2016. And he would not singlehandedly be able to revolutionise America's 75-year-long transatlantic partnership.

This is not to say that the recent cracks in the Western camp are meaningless. For the West, and therefore for Ukraine, 2024 will be more difficult.

For democracies, long-term consensus in support for war has always been more complicated than for autocrats with no accountability.

While it is likely that the war will drag on throughout 2024, it cannot drag on indefinitely.

With Western hesitancy bolstering Russia, and in the absence of either a coup or a health-related issue leading to Putin's demise, the only foreseeable outcome will be a negotiated settlement that for now both sides continue to refuse.

The course of war in 2024 will be determined elsewhere

Michael Clarke, former director general of the Royal United Services Institute

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the return of major war to the European continent. The course of the conflict in 2023 marked the fact that industrial-age warfare had returned too.

Industrial-age warfare bends significant parts, or in some cases whole economies, towards the production of war materials as matters of priority. Russia's defence budget has tripled since 2021 and will consume 30% of government spending next year.

This will make the war in Ukraine a longer and more traumatic enterprise than anything Europe has known since the middle of the last century. The coming year will demonstrate whether Russia - and its suppliers in North Korea and Iran - or Ukraine - and its Western backers - are able and prepared to meet the voracious demands of industrial-age warfare.

It would be wrong to say that the front lines in Ukraine are stalemated, but both sides are capable of fighting each other to a standstill as they each try to take strategic initiatives.

Russian forces may try to push again along the entire front, at least to secure all of the Donbas region. Ukraine will probably try to exploit the success it has had in re-establishing its control over the western Black Sea and its vital trade corridor to the Bosphorus.

And Kyiv will likely also try to spring more military surprises on the Russian invaders to knock them off-balance in some areas.

But in essence, 2024 looks like being a year of consolidation for both Kyiv and Moscow.

Russia lacks the equipment and trained manpower to launch a strategic offensive until spring 2025, at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Ukraine needs Western finance and military support to keep it in the war during next year while it, too, builds up its intrinsic strengths to create the conditions for a series of liberating offensives in the future.

Industrial-age warfare is a struggle between societies. What happens on the battlefield becomes ultimately only the symptom of that struggle.

The military course of this war in 2024 will be determined in Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang more than in Avdiivka, Tokmak, Kramatorsk or any of the devastated battlefields along the frontlines.

US fighter jets could make a difference

Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe

Russia lacks a decisive, breakthrough capability to overrun Ukraine and will do what it can to hold on to what it currently occupies, using the time to strengthen its defences while it hopes for the West to lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.

But Ukraine will not stop. It is in a fight for its survival and understands what Russia will do if it stops. More European nations are now talking about the need to step up aid in light of concerns that the US is weakening in its resolve.

Getty Images

Presidents Biden and Zelensky during the G7 summit in Hiroshima in May

I do, however, anticipate that early in the new year the US will rediscover its strategic backbone and pass the aid package that was delayed in Congress in December.

Therefore, I anticipate Ukraine will do the following in the coming months as it prepares to regain the initiative:

reconstitute units which have been worn down from months of fighting, which will be necessary for a renewed offensive

improve the recruiting system within Ukraine to maximise available manpower

increase production of ammunition and weapons

improve its ability to operate against strong Russian electronic warfare capabilities - jamming, intercepting, locating.

By early summer Ukraine will be able to use US-made F16 fighter jets for the first time, which it hopes will improve its ability to counter Russian aircraft and strengthen its own air defences.

The most strategically important part of Ukraine that remains occupied by Russia is Crimea, which is what we call the ""decisive terrain"".

Ukraine will do all it can to keep pressure on the Russians there to make it untenable for the Russian navy in Sevastopol, the handful of air force bases there and their logistics base at Dzankoy.

They have already proven the concept. With just three UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles, they have forced the commander of the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw a third of his fleet from Sevastopol.

The Ukrainians do not have unlimited resources of course, especially artillery ammunition and long-range precision weapons.","Ukraine war: Three ways the conflict could go in 2024Getty ImagesA Ukrainian soldier looks out from a tank near Bakhmut, eastern UkraineThe conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year.

A woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard, 32, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Dee Dee Blanchard in Missouri in 2015.

She plotted with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother following years of abuse.

He stabbed Dee Dee Blanchard to death with a knife her daughter gave him and the pair fled the scene.

They were then arrested hundreds of miles away in Wisconsin where Godejohn lived. He is serving a life sentence without parole.

The case sparked intense media interest and spawned a number of documentary series and TV shows.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard walked out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri at 03:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Thursday having served seven years of a 10-year sentence.

While in prison, she gave a number of interviews detailing her mother's abusive behaviour and a memoir she wrote while behind bars is due to be published in January.

In a recent interview with People Magazine she said: ""Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.""

Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly abused her daughter for years by convincing her that she was disabled and required medical support.

She told people that Blanchard had multiple conditions including epilepsy, vision impairments and muscular dystrophy.

She received support from charities and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, often portraying her daughter as younger than she actually was and subjecting her to unneeded medical treatments.

Blanchard used a wheelchair, feeding tube and an oxygen tank even though she could walk and had no health issues.

She later said her mother kept her weak and isolated. Blanchard soon became more interested in the outside world, making a dating profile and meeting Godejohn.

""I wanted to be free of her hold on me,"" she said during Godejohn's trial. ""I talked him into it.""

She reached a plea deal with prosecutors due to the abuse she had suffered, which meant a 10-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty.","Gypsy Rose Blanchard released early from US prisonBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsBlanchard familyGypsy Rose Blanchard with her mother Dee Dee BlanchardA woman who conspired to kill her abusive mother in a case that gripped the US has been released early from prison.

Venezuela has ordered the armed forces to hold military exercises in response to the UK's decision to send a warship to support neighbouring Guyana.

Military leaders said 5,600 soldiers would take part in ""defensive"" exercises on Venezuela's eastern Caribbean and Atlantic coasts.

Earlier this month, Venezuelan voters backed the creation of a new state in oil-rich Essequibo.

Guyana has administered the area for decades.

In a television address on Thursday, President Nicolás Maduro said the exercises were being launched ""in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country"".

He added that the move was ""practically a military threat from London"" and broke the ""spirit"" of a recent agreement reached between Venezuela and Guyana not to use force to settle their dispute.

Guyanese Vice-President Bharrat Jagdeo said the ship's presence was ""routine"" and part of building a ""defensive capability"".

""We don't plan on invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and he need not have any worry about that,"" he told a press conference.

On Sunday, the UK confirmed HMS Trent would take part in joint exercises with Guyana after Christmas.

It had been deployed to the Caribbean to search for drug smugglers, but was re-tasked after Venezuela's government threatened to annex the Essequibo region of Guyana.

Venezuela has long claimed ownership of Essequibo, a 61,000 sq-mile region which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana.

Watch: Haley leaves out slavery as a cause of US Civil War

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says the US Civil War was about slavery after facing criticism for not mentioning it as a cause during a town hall event.

A voter in New Hampshire on Wednesday asked her what caused the war.

Appearing startled by the question, she did not name slavery in her response.

""I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do,"" she said.

Her remarks were quickly criticised by the voter who asked the question. He said that it was ""astonishing"" that she answered without mentioning the word slavery in the year 2023.

""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" Ms Haley responded.

But after facing a blowback on social media, the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor acknowledged it as a cause on Thursday.

""Of course the Civil War was about slavery,"" she told CNN.

""We know that. That's the easy part of it. What I was saying was what does it mean to us today? What it means to us today is about freedom. That's what that was all about.""

Speaking to radio station The Pulse of NH on Thursday, Ms Haley also claimed the voter was a ""Democrat plant"".

The Wednesday event in Berlin, New Hampshire was a part of Ms Haley's push to win over voters before the early upcoming Republican primary election in the state.

Ms Haley has risen in opinion polls in recent weeks.

She faces her first test at the Iowa caucuses in early January. While she trails behind former President Donald Trump by a wide margin, she is neck-and-neck with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another high-profile challenger.

President Joe Biden was among the dozens of Democrats who criticised Ms Haley after her comments in New Hampshire. He posted a video of her exchange on X, formerly Twitter, with the caption: ""It was about slavery.""

Her Republican political opponents also seized on the controversy. A campaign account for Mr DeSantis shared a video of her comments with one word: ""Yikes"".

A number of civil rights scholars weighed in as well, saying the fight over slavery was a central cause of the Civil War.

South Carolina was the first state to secede during the Civil War and as a former state governor Ms Haley has faced questions about the issue before.

L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers

L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers has become the first woman to amass a $100bn (£78.5bn; €90.1bn) fortune, according to a ranking of the richest people in the world.

The French beauty empire founded by her grandfather is on track for its best stock market performance in decades.

L'Oréal shares rose to a record high in Paris on Thursday.

The firm has seen its sales rebound after the pandemic, when people under lockdown used less makeup.

The net worth of Ms Bettencourt Meyers, aged 70, crossed $100bn on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making her the 12th richest person in the world.

She is still a distance away from French counterpart Bernard Arnault, who was second on the list with a net worth of $179bn. Mr Arnault is the founder of LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, which owns a portfolio of high-end brands including Fendi and Louis Vuitton.

L'Oréal did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

Ms Bettencourt Meyers is the vice-chairperson of the company's board. She and her family are the single biggest shareholders of L'Oréal with a stake of around 35%.

Liliane, who was regularly named France's richest person, had maintained close ties with French leaders and embraced the media limelight.

During her later years, she was embroiled in a public fight with Françoise, her only child, who had accused a photographer and socialite of taking advantage of her mother's mental frailty.

""My daughter could have waited patiently for my death instead of doing all she can to precipitate it,"" she said in a TV interview.

In 2011, a French court ruled that Liliane had a form of dementia, and awarded François control over her wealth and income. Another family member was tasked to look after Liliane's health and physical well-being.

The fish can grow to four metres in length and weigh 200kg or more

Guillermo Otta Parum has been fishing in the Bolivian Amazon his whole life, for more than 50 years.

At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

But then a giant freshwater fish arrived, known locally as paiche or Arapaima gigas, to give it its scientific name.

""I thought this creature was a water snake, that it would attack everything, that eating it would be bad for you, that it might be poisonous,"" he recalls.

In fact, it is one of the biggest freshwater fishes in the world, growing up to 4m in length and weighing 200kg (440lb) or more.

Guillermo Otta Parum has been a fisherman for 50 years

It is estimated that every year, the paiche spreads another 40km deeper into the rivers of the Amazon basin.

Federico Moreno, director of the Beni Autonomous University's Centre for Aquatic Resources Research, says its size and appetite make it a serious threat to native fish stocks.

""It is a territorial fish, it takes over a body of water and scares off the native species. [That] is one of the serious problems. The other species flee from the predator and enter other bodies of water much further away, more remote and difficult to access.""

No one really knows the exact year that the paiche first appeared in Bolivia.

It is generally believed its arrival was the result of a breach of a paiche fish farm in Peru, where the fish are native. From there, they spread into Bolivia's rivers.

Biologist Fernando Carvajal has spent years studying the Paiche

Fernando Carvajal is a biologist and expert on the paiche. He says they are a ravenous species.

""During the first years of life, the paiche grows at the rate of 10kg a year. That means the paiche is eating a lot of fish.""

Unlike other predatory fish like piranha, it only has small, not particularly sharp teeth.

But its lack of impressive teeth does not stop it from eating piranha and a host of other fish, along with plants, molluscs and birds, all of which it hoovers up like a giant vacuum cleaner.

It also frightens off any fish which tries to eat the paiche's young.

Fernando Carvajal says there is no firm data about the impact of the paiche, but he says that anecdotally, fishermen are reporting that the numbers of some native species are dwindling.

""In the next one or two decades, the paiche is going to spread to all the potential areas where this species can live,"" he warns.

""We know that around the world, most invasive cases are bad for nature. Invasive species are considered the second-biggest reason for the loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction.""

However, for local fishermen, the arrival of the paiche has been a boon. Having been initially afraid of it, it did not take long for fishermen to realize its potential, says Guillermo Otta Parum.

Paiche fishing boat on the Yata River in the Bolivian Amazon

""When I brought the first fish, I would give the customers small pieces as a gift for them to try so they would get a taste for it.""

Some fishermen even pretended it was a type of catfish to overcome people's suspicions about eating such a huge specimen.

Now paiche are eaten across Bolivia.

Edson Suzano runs a paiche-processing plant in Riberalta, a town in north-east Bolivia close to the Brazilian border.

Edson Suzano (left) says the paiche is affordable

""We sell it everywhere - supermarkets, markets. There are different cuts, so it is affordable. We buy and process around 30,000kg per month,"" he says.

The challenge for the fishermen is trying to find the paiche in the huge expanse of the Amazon.

The fish has a lung-like organ and has to come up for air regularly to breathe and so likes calmer water. It prefers to live in lakes and lagoons, but migrates when it feels it is in danger.

The paiche migrates when it feels it is in danger

Most of the fish Edson Silvano processes used to arrive by boat.

Now the fishermen travel to ever more remote areas to catch the paiche and have to transfer from boats to canoes, on journeys of up to two weeks. This is putting them in conflict with indigenous communities.

These communities have been given land titles to many of the remote lagoons where paiche are now to be found and have themselves started fishing for and selling the fish.

Now commercial fishermen have to obtain special licences to work in these areas. But fishermen like Guillermo Otta Parum say that even when they have the correct paperwork, they are often turned away.

The indigenous communities argue that they are only trying to protect the resources which the Bolivian government has recognised they have a right to control.

Juan Carlos Ortiz Chavez is a paiche fisherman who belongs to the Alto Ivon Tco Chacobo indigenous community:

He says that in the past, indigenous people were scared of commercial fishermen. ""But this new generation of young people has changed, because we have made our rules so that people can't come and take from us any more,"" he explains.

Scientists such as Federico Moreno hope that fishing generally, whoever is doing it, will keep paiche numbers in check.

""Keep hunting them, keep fishing for them all the time and that could keep a balance between the different species.""","At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.

The Starship spacecraft's fiery end soon after launch – not once but twice – was a major moment in a year filled with landmark space missions.

""Failure is not an option"" was once the most famous phrase uttered in any of the world's mission control rooms. In 2023, it was ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" – after Elon Musk's new Starship spacecraft exploded. Twice, as it turned out.

Containing the most powerful rocket ever built, Starship is being developed by Musk's company SpaceX. It stands 121m (397ft) high, 9m (29.5ft) wide and has a total of 39 engines. The two-stage launch vehicle is designed to carry some 150 tonnes, or up to 100 people, into space before returning to Earth. SpaceX plans to use Starship to launch multiple satellites at once, Nasa has commissioned a version of the spacecraft to land astronauts on the Moon, and it may one day carry the first settlers to Mars.

""The idea of a fully reusable launch vehicle is hugely ambitious, and on that scale as well, is just tremendous,"" says David Wade, underwriter at the Atrium Space Consortium in London, which insures commercial satellites and launchers.

The first Starship launch from Texas in April lasted four minutes before the rocket exploded, showering debris over the Gulf of Mexico and partially destroying the launch pad. Following thousands of modifications, the second flight in November lasted about eight minutes and – despite another ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" – SpaceX declared the mission a success. (Find out whether Starship is the loudest space rocket ever launched.)

""Quite frankly, they've gone further than I was expecting on the second flight,"" says Wade. ""They are doing incredibly well.""

SpaceX has every reason to be optimistic. When the company was conceived by Musk in the early 2000s it promised to shake-up the rocket business. But the first flight of its Falcon-1 also ended in failure and many people were sceptical of its plans to reuse launchers. Now, 20 years on, some of its rockets have been flown 18 times and SpaceX completely dominates the launcher market and regularly flies astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) in its Dragon spacecraft.

""Ten years ago this place, the Space Coast, was basically dead and, after the Shuttle retired, well over 10,000 people got laid off,"" says Ken Kremer, managing editor of the website Space UpClose, who covers launches from Florida. ""But in the last four or five years, it's started to rebound and aerospace companies are coming back – it's really a boomtown here right now and that's almost all due to SpaceX.""

It's going to take a tremendous amount of work, it's incredibly complicated – Ken Kremer

Today, launches from Cape Canaveral are as frequent as one a week. But despite SpaceX's success and ambition, Kremer is sceptical about Nasa's plans to use Starship as a giant lunar lander.

""It's going to take a tremendous amount of work, it's incredibly complicated,"" he says. ""They will have to land upright or the astronauts will die it if it tumbles over – it's going to take about 16 launches before they can land one Starship on the Moon.""

And 51 years after Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan left the last footprint, the Moon is once again the place to be. What is perhaps surprising is that the most ambitious mission in decades was led, not by the traditional space superpowers, but India. On 23 August, Chandrayann-3 made history when it became the first mission to touch down at the lunar south pole.

""It was a globally significant,"" says Mila Mitra, former Nasa scientist and Delhi-based co-founder of education company Stem and Space. ""Landing at the Moon's south pole was much more difficult because it's got more craters, so India has proved that technology, and it was also able to build this mission at a much-reduced cost.""

Live coverage of the landing was laden with patriotism, cutting to India's President Narendra Modi waving the nation's flag as the lander touched down. The mission rover even had the Indian space agency's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels, which left an imprint in the lunar regolith.

The engineers and scientists behind Chandraayn-3 are right to be proud. Despite having only 14 days of power, the rover managed some significant science: finding sulphur, registering a likely moonquake and discovering a temperature difference of around 60C (140F) between the surface and just a few centimetres down.

""This possibly indicates that the topsoil of the Moon may be a very good insulator,"" says Mitra. ""That's promising in terms of finding water underground that might be in the form of ice.""

Confirming the presence of readily available ice would enable future missions to use water for survival and to extract oxygen for air and hydrogen for fuel. It's one of the reasons why the lunar south pole is the destination for Nasa's mission to return humans to the Moon, Artemis III. (Read more about the mysteries of the Moon's south pole.)

Nasa's Osiris-Rex mission could find clues about the origins of life

Unlike the space race of the 1960s, Russia is largely out of the running. Its attempt to beat India to the lunar south pole, Luna 25, crashed into the Moon and its Soyuz spacecraft is a relic from the dawn of the space age. But China is fast catching up with the US. In May, China had six astronauts on board its Tiangong space station (on 30 May, with 11 astronauts on the ISS, there were 17 people in orbit at once – a new record) and it is quietly developing its next generation rockets and spacecraft.

""If [lawmakers] continue to cut Nasa's budget, it is going to delay Project Artemis, it'll delay Starship and the Blue Origin lander too,"" Kremer warns. ""The Chinese could beat us to the Moon, they could beat us to the [lunar] south pole, and that would be really terrible, really terrible.""

But while the race to plant the next flag on the Moon heats-up, some questions in space exploration are so fundamental that they cut through geopolitics. Nasa's Osiris-Rex mission, for example, could find clues about the origins of life. The space probe collected samples of rock from asteroid Bennu and, in September, returned a capsule of material to Earth. Scientists hope the 500m-wide (1,650ft) asteroid will provide new insights into the formation of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago and possibly even how we got here.

Why visit the 'God of Chaos' asteroid? During it's close encounter with the Earth in 2029, the asteroid Apophis will be visible with the naked eye in the Eastern Hemisphere. Nasa's Osiris-Rex spacecraft will then spend 18 months alongside the asteroid – which is named after the Egyptian god of Chaos – so scientists can study how the encounter with Earth has changed it. The spacecraft will repeat a dramatic manoeuvre it performed at Bennu - flying within 5m (16ft) of the asteroid's surface and firing its thrusters downwards to stir up rocks and dust on the surface to give a glimpse of what lies beneath.

In the final days of 2023, Nasa announced it is to redirect the Osiris-Rex spacecraft on a new mission to study the asteroid Apophis shortly after the 340m (1,115ft) wide lump of silicate and nickel iron passes within 20,000 miles (32,000km) of the Earth in 2029.

The European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope, meanwhile, is probing the very nature of the Universe. The first images from Euclid were released in November and cover a vast area of the sky in extraordinary detail. But cosmologists using the telescope are less interested in what they can see than what they can't.

Only 5% of the Universe is made of atoms – that's the stuff we can detect. The rest is known as ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"". Dark matter is theorised to be the scaffolding that holds everything in place and dark energy is the mysterious component that drives the expansion of the Universe.

""It's one of the biggest problems in physics,"" says Isobel Hook, professor of astrophysics at Lancaster University in the north of England. ""It's extremely frustrating that we don't know what it is and there's no real convincing theoretical explanation, certainly for dark energy.

""If you just look at the number of people involved in a mission like Euclid, you can see how important it is. There are thousands of people around the world involved in this, wanting to get to the answer.""

Euclid will observe billions of galaxies to build up a map of at least a third of the visible Universe

In April, scientists using the, now dismantled, Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile produced a new map of the distribution of dark matter. Over the next six years, Euclid will observe billions of galaxies to build up a map of at least a third of the visible Universe. Although it will not be able to see the missing matter, Euclid can detect its influence by observing how its gravity bends and distorts light, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.

""For dark matter, it will tell us where it is and map it out,"" says Hook. ""In terms of what dark matter and dark energy are, we'll be narrowing down the possibilities by seeing the effects.""

As for 2024, we can look forward to further robotic lunar missions, the launch of Europa Clipper to Jupiter's ice-covered moon and the maiden flight of Europe's (much delayed) new rocket Ariane 6. It should also see the most exciting human space mission in decades: Nasa's Artemis II. The first crewed launch of the SLS rocket and Orion capsule, the Artemis II mission will send four astronauts on a 21-day flight into deep space around the Moon.

If successful, Artemis II will set the stage for the first Moon landing since 1972. But that currently depends on Starship; third time lucky?

Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come.

February: TikTok bans go global

Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly.

In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.

In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions.

In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections.

March and May: Three US banks fail

The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"".

By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future.

May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America

Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape.

Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing.

The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter.

Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis.

The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.

May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap

There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap.

It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom.

July: Twitter becomes X

In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next.

Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.

Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.

Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content.

September: Rupert Murdoch steps down

After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair.

In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's.

October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial

Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.

Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.

One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more.

October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard

Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.

In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal.

November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection

Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning.

Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand.

December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court

At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward.

If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024.","Ten major events that shaped business in 2023By Meredith Turits Features correspondent @meredithturitsAlamySam Bankman-Fried's fall cast a shadow over crypto's legitimacy and future (Credit: Alamy)Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Meatballs are a classic comfort food beloved by all three Scandinavian nations (Credit: Columbus Leth)

The meatball in its myriad forms is well loved across Scandinavia. And in her book, Simply Scandinavian, Trine Hahnemann shares her secrets for a light and crispy version.

At this time of year in Scandinavia, as nights grow colder and darker and people gather around fires and cosy tables, the meatball really shines. A classic comfort food beloved by all three Scandinavian nations – Denmark, Sweden and Norway – meatballs are simultaneously an easy weeknight meal for busy families and the kind of dish you'd see on the menu for a large gathering or celebration.

The origin of the meatball is more than a little unclear. According to food historian Nina Bauer, like the pancake, the meatball was invented simultaneously in many countries worldwide, so no one country can lay claim to it. It remains, however, a classic food across Scandinavia, though not without its differences.

""We all have different words for them,"" Bauer said. ""In Denmark, we call a ball of meat that is pan-fried a frikadelle.""

The Danish meatball is a little rugged in texture and can be served in multiple ways – with a lightly spiced curry sauce, for example, or a rich gravy. A Swedish meatball, in comparison to the crispy, pan-fried Danish version, is often a little smaller, with a very smooth, even texture and a rounder shape. You shouldn't be able to spot any of the individual ingredients in a Swedish meatball, such as diced onions, plus it's eaten with lingonberry jam. In Norway, the meatball is larger and flatter and more like a meat patty, served with a brown gravy.

""In Denmark, we trace the roots of the frikadelle back to the 1600s, with a recipe, maybe German in origin, written for a sausage without a casing seasoned with saffron and ginger. This sausage without a casing becomes a meatball eaten in a soup and stew,"" said Bauer.

When meat grinders and cast-iron stove tops became common in Denmark in the mid-19th Century, everything changed for the meatball and its role in society.

""Before then, it was an aristocratic food because you needed a servant to work on the meat with a knife all morning,"" said Bauer. ""The arrival of the meat grinder democratises it all and a kind of euphoria takes place, where people start to think about what to do with it.""

Columbus Leth

Today, the modern-day Danish meatball comes in different guises. Trine Hahnemann, cook and author of the recently published cookbook Simply Scandinavian, said this is partly because there is a lot of minced meat available in Denmark, thanks to the many milking cows on its farms.

""When they get slaughtered, you have to make mincemeat out of them,"" she said. ""You can't use the meat in any other way. So, we have many traditional meals that stem from this minced meat, including frikadeller (plural) and meatballs in curry sauce. I grew up eating meatballs in a celeriac sauce, and we always ate the leftovers the next day on rye bread.""

Food waste is a big focus for Hahnemann, who notes that the meatball is so important that she has never written a cookbook without a frikadelle recipe in it. ""It is a good way to get use out of your leftovers,"" she said. ""You can put vegetables in them and stretch out the meat.""

Hahnemann's meatball is quintessentially Danish, but she acknowledges that the addition of courgette and sparkling water is a little unusual. If you don't eat red meat, you can use minced chicken instead of pork and beef, advises Hahnemann. Or, for a vegetarian version, grate a variety of root vegetables to replace the minced meat.

Her best advice for making a light fried Danish meatball is to do something her family has been doing for generations. ""If you want them to be not too heavy, go easy on the flour,"" she advised. ""Don't use milk because that makes them heavy – use sparkling water. That's a piece of advice my grandmother passed on to me. It feels counter intuitive, but it makes the meatball lighter and fluffier.""

Frikadeller with sweet and sour cucumber salad recipe by Trine Hahnemann

Serves 4

Ingredients For the salad: 250ml (1 cup) distilled vinegar (5% acid) 50ml (¼ cup) water 125g (4½oz) caster (superfine) sugar 1 tsp flaked sea salt (or kosher salt) freshly ground black pepper 1 tsp mustard seeds 1 tsp black peppercorns 2 large cucumbers For the meatballs: 250g (9oz) minced (ground) pork 250g (9oz) minced (ground) beef 1 courgette (zucchini), grated (shredded) 1 onion, grated (shredded) 2 garlic cloves, grated (shredded) 1 tbsp chopped thyme leaves 3 eggs, lightly beaten 50g (1¾oz) breadcrumbs 3 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour 50ml (¼ cup) sparkling water 50g (½ stick) salted butter 2 tbsp neutral-tasting vegetable oil

Method

Step 1 Start with the cucumber salad because it needs to pickle for 30 minutes. Whisk together the vinegar, water and sugar. When all the sugar has dissolved, add the salt and some ground black pepper, along with the mustard seeds and peppercorns. Halve the cucumbers lengthways, scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon, then cut into half-moons 5mm (¼in) thick. Place the cucumbers in the brine, gently folding now and then, until ready to serve.

Step 2 To make the meatballs, mix the minced meats, courgette, onion, garlic, thyme and eggs together and mix well. Fold in the breadcrumbs and flour and mix again. Lastly, mix in the sparkling water and season with salt and pepper.

Step 3 Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4. Melt the butter and oil in a frying pan (skillet). Use a spoon and your free hand to shape the meat mixture into medium-sized oval balls. Place in the butter and oil and fry on all sides until golden brown.

Step 4 Transfer to an ovenproof dish and bake in the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking. Take the cucumber out of the brine (you can reuse the brine, so don't throw it away), and serve it in a bowl alongside the frikadeller.

Britain's most famous steam locomotive turned 100 this year, and along the way it has inspired poets, Hitchcock, Harry Potter and Royalty. What makes it such an enduring icon?

Some grow misty-eyed with nostalgia at the mere mention of them, waiting for hours on a windy platform just to get a glimpse or a photo of these stars of a bygone age. Others find them smelly, dirty, and their hooting and screeching too much to bear. We're talking about steam engines, and although travelling by locomotive may be a rare treat for most, the golden age of steam is being kept alive at the many heritage railways around the world, with more than 30 still running in the UK alone.

More like this:

Firmly in the steam-age fan camp is presenter and author Michael Palin – a self-confessed train spotter who, in a 1980 BBC documentary, reflected: ""I suppose true railway buffs love all engines – short, fat, squat, long. Rumbling smelly diesels or swiftly silent electrics. But most of all, they love steam… And the most famous steam engine of them all is the Flying Scotsman.""

The locomotive's history has had many highs and lows

Today, the Flying Scotsman is still arguably the most famous steam locomotive on the planet, drawing huge crowds whenever it makes an appearance. Since it turned 100 in February, there have been celebrations and steam-related events to mark its grand old age, including a visit by the King in June; culminating in a Christmas programme of excursions at the National Rail Museum, which owns it. Not to mention an illustrated children's book on the steam age by Michael Morpurgo; a tribute poem by Simon Armitage; and a new film featuring those whose lives have been touched by it.

What is it about the Flying Scotsman that has led to its enduring fame and popularity above all other steam engines? Why has it earned a place in the hearts of many nations, but especially the Brits? The locomotive's history has had many highs and lows, and a moment when it seemed destined for the scrapheap, only to be saved for the modern age.

Completed in February 1923, at a cost of almost £8,000, the Flying Scotsman was originally built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), to a design by its chief engineer, Sir Nigel Gresley. It weighed 97 tonnes, was 70ft in length, and was one of the Pacific type (class A1) express tender locomotives – the most powerful used by the railway.

It was not, in fact, built in Scotland, as many believe, but in Doncaster in the north of England; and the story behind its naming holds a clue to its early fame, says Andrew Mclean, chief curator at the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York. ""The locomotive was deliberately named by the LNER after the 'Flying Scotsman', which was the unofficial name of its famous flagship service, the Special Scotch Express; launched in 1852, it ran daily from London's King's Cross to Edinburgh,"" he says. LNER advertised that service as ""The Most Famous Train in the World""; that, coupled with the public's confusion over the difference between a locomotive and a train, boosted its fame no end. (To clarify, Scotsman is a locomotive or engine, and pulls the carriages of a train.)

""Scotsman was not revolutionary in the way George and Robert Stephenson's Rocket was,"" says Mclean, referring to the 1829 steam locomotive considered the greatest innovation of the Victorian era. ""Nor was it the largest, most powerful or fastest.""

Steve Morgan/ Science Museum Group

The steam age was a golden era for locomotives, and in its early days, the Flying Scotsman was the epitome of stylish travel (Credit: Steve Morgan/ Science Museum Group)

Being selected for the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley in 1924 kickstarted its fame, and since then it has broken numerous records. In 1928, it hauled the first nonstop run of the northbound Flying Scotsman train service; in 1934 it set the world steam speed record of 100mph (though it was beaten a year later by Papyrus, a sister loco); in Australia it made the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive at 422 miles in 1989; on the way back to England the next year, it became the first steam locomotive to circumnavigate the globe (with the aid of a ship, of course).

But it's not all been about piston-pumping strength – or as Poet Laureate Armitage puts it in his paean to the engine: ""its vast steel circumferences, straining, hissing, the rippling bodywork pouring with sweat, skirts trimmed with petticoats of steam"". Scotsman has been sprinkled with glamour and media innovation too, pulling trains on which cinema, radio and television were trialled, as well as a Louis XV-style restaurant and even a cocktail bar.

Charisma and drama

If an engine can have charisma and drama, it was first realised in the eponymously titled 1930 film, one of Britain's first ""Talkies"". It's astonishing now to imagine that actress Pauline Johnson was allowed to do her own stunts for it, clinging to the outside of the speeding loco. Director Alfred Hitchcock gave it a key role in his 1935 spy suspense film, The 39 Steps, as Robert Donat's character flees from assassins by boarding a Scotsman-led train from London to Edinburgh. As this century dawned, it was the role model for Harry Potter's Hogwarts Express, it has been claimed, famously arriving on platform 9¾ at King's Cross, and now on public show at Warner Bros studio tour London.

Hogwarts' engine is red – not a Scotsman hue. Its original colour was apple green, and in World War Two it was repainted wartime black, like all railway stock, returning to green after the war. It was all change again in 1948, when British Railways (BR) was formed, and UK rail travel was nationalised; the Scotsman was painted blue for a time, then BR Green, and numbered 60103 (its sixth and current number).

BR's modernisation in 1955 sounded a death knell for the steam age, and 1962 was the Scotsman's last full year of service. BR's last mainline steam-hauled passenger train ran on 11 August 1968. That evening, a documentary commemorated the end of the steam age, and among passengers travelling on Scotsman's non-stop from London to Edinburgh was the Reverend W Awdrey, who mourned the end of steam in one of his celebrated Thomas the Tank Engine stories, illustrated by John T Kenney.

Scotsman could have been consigned to the great loco scrapyard in the sky, but for a programme on its plight in 1966 on Blue Peter, the popular BBC children's series, that was prompted by thousands of children writing in protest. That, coupled with a growing interest in national heritage, led to it being rescued and restored by steam-loving businessmen, including Alan Pegler, Sir William McAlpine, and later pop music producer Pete Waterman. In 2004 it was acquired by the NRM, its future safe for now.

The Scotsman may be a national treasure, but it's not without competition. ""There's one locomotive that may draw a higher appeal and that would be Mallard,"" says Mclean referring to the fastest steam locomotive in the world. That doesn't seem to dent the Scotsman's appeal to enthusiastic crowds who cheer it on whenever it appears on tours of the US, Canada and Australia. When not on exhibit at the NMR in York, England, it can be found pulling excursions along the mainline or on British tourist railroads.

There is a degree of nostalgia attached to it, and harking back to a bygone age – but what's remarkable is that Scotsman still does its thing – Steve Morgan

Steve Morgan was the official photographer who documented Scotsman's centenary, and witnessed first-hand the excitement it can generate: ""I was amazed by its popularity,"" he says, ""and by the people who love it, from traditional steam engine freaks to young girls and women. They all seem to have a very personal attachment to it.""

Besides photographing the King with Scotsman and its crew, Morgan captured it being restored and maintained, giving an idea of its great size; and the women train drivers who took charge of it as part of International Women's Day. In the name of research, he even managed to squeeze into the engine's firebox, into which the fireman has the hard physical task of shovelling tonnes of coal. ""It was smelly and dirty, as you'd imagine, but fascinating too."" The coal used was once supplied by British mines until they shut down, and until recent years came from Russia; now it mostly comes from Poland and Czechia. The use of bio coal is being considered, says Mclean.

Morgan adds: ""Yes, there is a degree of nostalgia attached to it, and harking back to a bygone age. But what's remarkable is that Scotsman still does its thing. It has a life and an energy about it that a lot of other machines just don't.""

Mclean mulls over what Scotsman might mean to the Scottish people. Its name is perhaps confusing, since ""it only ran in service to Scotland for 10 years, from 1925 to 1935 – and then didn't make it over the border again until well into the 1960s"". He says in recent years, images of the Flying Scotsman puffing across the Forth Bridge have ""probably reinforced the idea that it's a Scottish icon, and the fact its designer, Gresley, was born in Edinburgh"".

Steve Morgan/ Science Museum Group

On the other hand, he adds: ""When it toured north America in the 1960s, it was billed as a British Trade Mission and was seen as symbolic of Britishness. [It toured] along with some mixed stereotypes including a butler hired from Fortnum and Mason, a Pipe Major, a man dressed in a suit of armour and, bizarrely, a Winston Churchill impersonator played by Churchill's own nephew."" Perhaps one of the iconic steam engine's greatest achievements is being a survivor, and its most recent record is as the oldest locomotive to travel on British railway tracks. It shows no sign of stopping doing what it does best.

""When you think about it, we've got these great symbols of British engineering and innovation, like Concorde and the Queen Mary,"" says Mclean. ""But while you can no longer travel in either of those, you can still travel by Flying Scotsman, which is pretty incredible.""","But most of all, they love steam… And the most famous steam engine of them all is the Flying Scotsman.""

From new artificial islands to the environmental devastation caused by the breach of Ukraine's Kakhovka Dam – this is how humanity has changed the face of our planet throughout the past year.

There are few places on the Earth where humans have not left a mark of some kind. An estimated 95% of our planet's landmass – not including Antarctica, even though humanity has left its imprint there, too – now show some signs of human activity. About 16% of that land has been heavily modified, according to one recent analysis.

Urban development, large-scale engineering works and mining projects are reshaping entire landscapes, while deforestation and agriculture are altering entire ecosystems. Pollution produced by humans can be found in almost every corner of our planet.

Earth's reshaping continued apace during 2023 – for better and for worse. Here are some of the most dramatic ways our species has changed the planet's surface this year.

Just two years ago, Pearson Reef in the South China Sea was little more than a tiny atoll among more than 100 reefs and specks of sand-covered coral – when viewed from space – that make up the Spratly Islands (see the image below to see how it looked in 2021). But Vietnam, which has occupied the island since the late 1970s, embarked on a major enlargement project towards the end of 2021. By dredging and landfilling, the country has added 163 acres (66ha) of land to the island, and created a sheltered harbour in the middle of the reef, which can be seen in this satellite image above taken in August 2023.

The growth in electric vehicles and other battery-powered devices, demand for lithium has soared in recent years. But warnings of an impending shortage of this critical metal in years to come has prompted a scrabble to open new mines to extract it. Among those to begin operations in 2023 was the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina's Jujuy Province. The bright-green evaporation ponds are clearly visible in this satellite image from Maxar Technologies. The lithium is extracted from the salt of the South American salars – salt flats – by turning it into a brine that is then evaporated to concentrate the lithium.

In the Shan Mountains of eastern Myanmar, shifting agricultural practices have transformed the surface of Inle Lake. Recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site, the lake is famous for floating gardens created by the villagers who live along its shores, as well as fishermen who row with their legs. But a growth in the large scale aquaculture of tomatoes has dramatically decreased the surface area of the lake.

Water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir in Ukraine have fallen drastically after its dam was destroyed, causing widespread ecological damage (Credit: Getty Images)

On 6 June 2023, a series of early morning blasts cracked open the Kakhovka Dam, causing water to surge into the Dnipro River and leading to severe flooding downstream in the days that followed. Ukraine's military accused Russia of deliberately blowing up the dam, while Russia blamed the Ukrainians. Without the dam to hold back the water, the landscape both above and below the dam was transformed over the months that followed. A network of canals that were fed by the reservoir ran dry during the summer and leaving those working in the surrounding farmland struggling to irrigate their crops.

Before the explosions, the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir were the highest they had been in a number of years, but after the dam was breached, it almost dried up. An assessment by the UN Environment Programme described the damage as a ""far-reaching environmental disaster"" that would stretch far beyond Ukraine's borders. The reservoir itself had been a fully functioning ecosystem that was decimated, while flooding downstream caused considerable damage to natural habitats and plant communities. The organisation warned that the damage caused by the breach of the dam was likely to be ""irreversible"".

Construction work on the project – which Saudi Arabia has been keen to promote as a high-tech eco-city that will be the ""blueprint for tomorrow"" – can be seen at one end of a road stretching between Gayal and Ras Al Sheikh Al Hamid. Some critics have also ⁠questioned the planned city's green credentials.

Workers faced both existential crises and found competitive advantages in AI this year (Credit: Alamy)

Heralded and decried in equal measure, artificial intelligence has already changed how we work now, and how we will in the future.

It has been just more than a year since OpenAI launched its chatbot, ChatGPT, yet the technology is already top of mind for most workers. In many cases, it's become a part of their daily routines.

AI has gone from feeling like an abstract idea to a familiar tool that can streamline workflows and generate new ideas. But not everyone has welcomed the technology, and instead see it as a threat to their very careers. It's a push-and-pull that's defined this year.

The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it. They also give us a peek into how AI might shape 2024, as the technology continues to evolve at lightning pace.

Workers are already depending on AI

Many employees have grown accustomed to using AI in their daily jobs for time-saving administrative tasks, particularly rudimentary writing and basic ideation. This is especially the case in knowledge-work positions, where AI shows potential to free up workers to do creative, more sophisticated tasks. (Some workers are even using the technology to write resumes and cover letters to get those jobs in the first place.)

But as more workers utilise AI, some employers are responding by curbing the technology's use in the workplace. This has included tacitly suppressing or outright banning access to tools like ChatGPT, with organisations worried about potential misuse or data leaks, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US.

Yet some employees who've come to heavily rely on the tools, whether for increased productivity or to get a leg up on colleagues, have had to backchannel to retain access. Social-media communities have even offered tips on how to secretly access the technology at work.

Some skilled jobs workers considered shielded from generative AI are now facing threats with evolving technology (Credit: Alamy)

AI is evolving to target some office jobs

Many people assumed AI would most likely replace humans in roles that are easily automated: think the customer service chatbots and grocery-delivering robots already busy at work.

But as it has evolved in the past year, it's clear that it could impact more complex knowledge work roles once considered ""safe"". Some creative jobs are already being threatened. For example, text-to-image generative AI programs like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create dazzling illustrations and photorealistic renders in moments – work that's typically reserved for highly skilled commercial art teams.

Data shows there's validity to workers' worries. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans – equating to 300 million jobs lost across Europe and the US.

""This isn't somebody else's problem now. It's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at US economic think tank organisation the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC. ""We don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""

But some jobs won't be replaced – yet

For all the fear, however, there are many roles and tasks that AI won't be capable of performing in the near future. That's particularly the case with jobs that demand soft skills, such as emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking.

Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, believes workers whose job it is to come up with new business strategies may be relatively safe from automation. He also predicts roles that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships – for example, nurses and business consultants – are hard for machines to replace. These are jobs, he says, that require ""a very deep understanding of people. I think it'll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships"".

Additionally, trade jobs that far pre-date digital work environments – such as electricians, plumbers and welders – are among the ""hardest of anything to automate"", says Ford. These jobs are less reliant on language-based tasks and typically require greater problem-solving ability, mobility and dexterity in unpredictable environments that machines cannot currently mimic.

We're also going to work with AI

As AI becomes more ubiquitous, some experts believe the technology is actually more likely to augment – rather than replace – human talent. Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, cites medical diagnoses as an example. While a robot may be able to detect cancer, for instance, most patients would prefer a qualified medical professional to break the news.

Workers are already utilising ChatGPT as a personal assistant, using it to draft emails, plan itineraries and project costs and timelines. More broadly, professionals are already using AI to help eliminate bias in decision making – some large corporations are already employing data-driven recruitment to test candidates' qualities, with behavioural insights matching them with the right vacancy.

And while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones; for example, data engineers, governance specialists and a host of ""training"" roles.

Alongside much fear and uncertainty, there's optimism

AI may be the technology of the day, but it's far from the first to disrupt the workforce. Technology has advanced exponentially over the decades, from the rise of automation in mechanics, to office computers and wireless internet.

""Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, it has the potential to automate or streamline work processes,"" says Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at PwC, based in Austin, US. ""However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements.""","The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it.

From Toronto to Tokyo, these five cities remain surprisingly affordable compared to their more costly neighbours.

Prices have been rising rapidly in cities across the world, driving the cost of living higher than ever before. In fact, the average price of goods and services rose 7.4% year over year, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) recently released 2023 Worldwide Cost of Living Report. That's marked a huge jump from the 2.9% average over the past five years.

But not everywhere has been impacted equally. The report ranks 173 cities based on prices of food, clothing, rent and transportation and other costs of 200+ goods and services. When compared to the report's global index, some cities remain relatively low-cost compared to places like Singapore and Zurich, both of which tied for the most expensive place to live. Many cities in Asia, for instance, became relatively less expensive, with 46 out of 58 cities slipping down the rankings due to a more sluggish economic recovery.

Some cities also remain surprisingly affordable compared to their more-costly neighbours. For travellers or digital nomads, these places can offer the same big-city amenities at a much lower cost of living. We spoke to residents and recent travellers to the cities that ranked as less expensive on the annual EIU index when compared to their continent's other cities, and heard their advice on what makes living more affordable – and how to make the travel cash go even further.

Lisbon, Portugal

As the least-expensive city in Western Europe, according to the EIU rankings, Lisbon has been a hotspot for digital nomads in recent years, especially due to its 2022 digital nomad visa that lets freelancers and remote workers stay for one to two years. Its relatively lower costs (56% lower than other cities in Western Europe, according to travel cost site Expatistan) also make it an attractive destination for travellers.

""Lisbon was one of the top cities on my bucket list, and this summer, I was finally able to see this vibrant destination for myself,"" said Mercedes Zach of Asaptickets. ""It is not only beautiful, welcoming and fun, but also full of budget-friendly things to do.""

Zach recommends exploring the bohemian Bairro Alto neighbourhood to uncover street art, city views and sunset gatherings with locals. She also enjoyed exploring the free Parque Eduardo VII central park, which features estufas (greenhouses) that showcase exotic plants from Portugal and the tropics. The free Museu do Teatro Romano gives a peek into the city's Roman past, with preserved theatre ruins.

To experience authentic fado music, Zach suggests heading to the affordable Tasca do Chico. ""The old, cosy tavern is adorned with photos, posters and clippings of the soulful fado singers and performers and the atmosphere there is genuinely authentic,"" she said. ""It also offers amazing live fado shows without any entrance fees."" She recommends going on Mondays or Wednesdays, when there's local singers and fewer crowds.

Buenos Aires, Argentina

With the worst inflation rates in the world and plummeting currency valuations, Buenos Aires made the bottom 10 cities of the index – ranking 163 out of 173. The currency destabilisation has brought more strength than ever to the US dollar, which is sought after by residents as a way to preserve their savings. Known as the dólar blue or ""blue dollar rate"", this exchange rate is often taken advantage of by travellers on the ground via Western Union.

Money here goes much further than it did even five years ago, but it helps to be savvy about it. ""One thing I picked up is that it's way better to pay in cash rather than using a foreign credit card,"" said Josephine Remo Finderup, a writer and a digital nomad. ""It's one of those little tricks that really makes a difference in how far your money goes."" Because rent and food are so much more affordable here, she's planning to stay six months before heading back to Europe.

The right neighbourhood can also lower costs. Alex Trembath, travel blogger at Career Gappers, recently stayed in the historic San Telmo neighbourhood, which he found was an ideal base for budget activities. ""There's a lively weekly market on Sundays, many affordable places to eat and drink, and some fantastic free walking tours to explore the art and culture of the area and the nearby Boca neighbourhood,"" he said.

He also went to a milonganight, where visitors can learn how to tango with locals. ""It's a lot cheaper than going to one of the touristy tango shows,"" he said. ""And a more authentic experience.""

Travellers find Toronto to be an affordable and welcoming destination, especially for families (Credit: Istvan Kadar Photography/Getty Images)

Toronto, Canada

While North American inflation has slowed, big US cities like New York and Los Angeles still rank within the top-10 most-expensive places in the world. Meanwhile, Canadian cities to the north continue to remain lower in the cost-of-living rankings. Of all the Canadian cities ranked, Toronto ranks the most affordable, coming in at number 27.

Combined with being one of the world's most liveable cities, travellers find Toronto to be an affordable and welcoming destination, especially for families.

Toronto resident Stephanie Ciccarelli, co-founder of vacation rental platform Lake, recommends city sightseeing via boat cruise on Lake Ontario, visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame, or ascending the iconic CN Tower. ""A fan favourite is going up the tower in its high-speed elevator to walk the iconic observation deck for a panoramic view of the cityscape and waterfront,"" said Ciccarelli.

Toronto is also known as ""the City within a Park"", with plenty of green space available for time in nature. ""I love being able to leave my apartment and go on a nice walk or hike and enjoy the outdoors,"" said Toronto resident Natalia Buia. Her favourites include High Park, Trinity Bellwoods and Toronto Island Park.

And while she says inflation can definitely still be felt here, you can find a diverse array of food at every price point. ""Whether you want to grab a bite at a local dive or spoil yourself with fine dining, you can find literally any type of food you want at any time of day,"" said Buia. ""Much like in New York, there's no shortage of exquisite restaurant options – but I argue it's a tad bit more affordable here!""

Tokyo, Japan

Moving three down the index this year and ranking 60 overall, Tokyo continues to be Japan's most expensive city yet is now more affordable than fellow Asian cities like Singapore and Hong Kong. While other countries battle inflation, Japan has been in a multi-year battle with deflation, trying to maintain the monetary strength of the yen. This combined with Japan only recently completely reopening to tourism post-Covid makes it an especially affordable time for travellers to visit.

""The cost of living in Tokyo ranks well behind cities like New York City, London and Singapore,"" said Tokyo resident Masa Yamamoto, senior manager of corporate communications at real-estate developer Mori. That makes the urban attractions and big-city experiences much more accessible here, and the plentiful nature opportunities within the city itself can keep costs low.

Yamamoto encourages tourists to stroll the 24,000 sq m of urban gardens and public art installations at the newly developed Azabudai Hills neighbourhood for free. ""Visitors will be surrounded by 320 species of plants and can enjoy an orchard with 11 types of fruit trees, including mandarin oranges, blueberries, lemons, apples, peaches and plums,"" he said.

For a new perspective on the city, he recommends the contemporary art Mori Art Museum and its connected Tokyo City View, which offers a view of the city from 250m above sea level for just 2,000 yen.

Perth, Australia

Ranking as much more affordable than its eastern neighbours Sydney and Melbourne, Perth offers residents a laid-back lifestyle that's made even easier with its temperate climate, beautiful beaches and abundant nature. Since Perth has a high number of employees in the mining sector, salaries also tend to be higher here, which gives locals more spending power.

""Perth's affordability lets me live a more relaxed lifestyle. My rent would double or even triple for a comparable apartment in Sydney,"" said Nadia Cuthbertson, Perth resident and founder of Perth Weekend. ""I've got more disposable income to get out and about and enjoy activities like cocktails at rooftop bars and seafood dinners overlooking the ocean.""

Her favourite rooftop spots include the Rooftop at QT for its spectacular view, and Mechanics Institute for its more laid-back atmosphere, but she also recommends fish and chips at the iconic Cottesloe Beach as the sun sets over the ocean. For those looking to explore nature, she recommends renting a catamaran from South Perth Foreshore to sail the Swan River, or trying snorkelling at Mettams Pool, a naturally formed lagoon featuring starfish and molluscs.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67782971,Arsenal 0-2 West Ham: Hammers stun Gunners who miss chance to go top of league,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Tomas Soucek scored West Ham's 300th goal in Premier League London derbies

West Ham stunned Arsenal to record a third successive Premier League victory, denting the Gunners' title challenge in the process.

It was a ruthless display by West Ham, who converted two of their three shots on target, while Arsenal squandered a host of opportunities as they missed the chance to move top of the league.

Tomas Soucek fired in Jarrod Bowen's cutback and, while the ball had potentially gone out of play in the build-up, there was not enough evidence for the video assistant referee to overturn the goal.

That gave West Ham a first-half lead which was doubled when former Arsenal centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos expertly headed in a corner in the 55th minute.

Despite plenty of possession and pressure, Arsenal could not find a response.

And their woeful night was nearly made worse when Declan Rice gave away a penalty in the final minute of injury time, but Said Benrahma's effort was saved by David Raya.

The result leaves Mikel Arteta's Gunners second in the table, two points behind league leaders Liverpool, while West Ham end the year with 33 points - their highest total at the halfway stage in a Premier League campaign.

Missed opportunity for Gunners

Declan Rice left West Ham for a fee rising to £105m in the summer to join Arsenal

Arsenal's undoing was their inability to convert dominance and possession into goals.

As the match wore on, their failure to capitalise only led to frustration - not only on the pitch but also in the stands, as fans grew weary and the atmosphere drained at Emirates Stadium.

Opportunities were spurned as Bukayo Saka struck the post in the first half, Gabriel Martinelli fired wide and Gabriel Jesus headed high.

Ex-West Ham captain Rice later fizzed an effort over the bar, before Hammers goalkeeper Alphonse Areola denied Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard.

It was a stark contrast to West Ham's fortunes and the visitors were able to brilliantly fend off countless attacks with selfless defending.

Arsenal's lack of ruthlessness could prove costly with five teams sitting within six points of each other at the top of the Premier League. There is little room for error.

Season's greetings for Hammers

West Ham's results in December have been a festive treat with Moyes' side backing up an impressive win over Manchester United with this stunning result at the Emirates.

It means they sit sixth in the table, well in the mix for European qualification, following four wins, one draw and one defeat in the league this month.

Despite losing England midfielder Rice in the summer, who lined up for Arsenal against his former club for the first time, West Ham have shown maturity and growth in the first part of the campaign and have been rewarded with their highest points tally.

But there will be an anxious wait to learn the extent of Lucas Paqueta's injury - the Brazilian midfielder had ice strapped to his left leg after being forced off in the 31st minute, having pulled up in the warm-up before being risked anyway.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67782972,Brighton 4-2 Tottenham: Joao Pedro scores two penalties in win for Seagulls,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Eight of Joao Pedro's 13 goals for Brighton this season have come from the penalty spot

A superb display saw Brighton overcome Tottenham in the Premier League at the Amex Stadium.

Spurs dominated the early possession but the hosts took control when teenager Jack Hinshelwood fired into the roof of the net after Joao Pedro was allowed to drift across the length of the 18-yard line.

Pedro doubled the Seagulls' lead from the penalty spot after Dejan Kulusevski had pulled back Danny Welbeck in the area.

Brighton continued to press, with James Milner hitting the post and Facundo Buonanotte having a goal disallowed for offside, before Richarlison also clipped the woodwork for the visitors.

Spurs failed to have a shot on target in the first half but improved in the second period, with Richarlison twice seeing efforts ruled out for offside.

However, Brighton made sure of the three points less than a minute after the second of those when Pervis Estupinan fired a brilliant 25-yard dipping effort into the top corner.

Pedro added a fourth goal when he sent Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way from the spot again after Evan Ferguson was bundled over in the area.

Tottenham threatened an unlikely comeback after Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled two back, but Spurs could not convert a string of other late chances.

""We played fantastic football for 80 minutes and then we were unlucky in the first goal we conceded,"" Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day.

""I think this season it was the best performance. Not just for Joao Pedro and Billy Gilmour, I am speaking in general for Brighton.""

The win sees Brighton climb above Newcastle into eighth, while Spurs stay fifth, a point behind fourth-placed Manchester City.

Fired-up Brighton deliver

A week without a game has been a rare luxury in Brighton's season as they experience European football for the first time, but they used the break to their advantage.

After allowing Spurs to have the ball early on, they were soon all over them, launching attack after attack.

De Zerbi has bemoaned Brighton's reliance on youth recently, but 18-year-old Hinshelwood was superb at right-back and took his goal with aplomb.

His strike was Brighton's 19th by a teenager in the Premier League in 2023 - Manchester United have the second most with four. Brighton's tally has only been bettered twice in Premier League history by Liverpool in 1998 (25) and 1994 (22).

Pedro was a constant handful, looking to exploit Spurs' high defensive line, and took both of his penalties clinically.

Estupinan's excellent strike put the gloss on the win, with the Ecuador left-back featuring for the first time since 30 September.

There will be disappointment they were unable to keep a clean sheet - they have now conceded in 23 straight league games - and that they had to weather a late storm, with De Zerbi throwing a water bottle in frustration during stoppage time.

All in all, this was a display that served as a reminder of what Brighton can do as we reach the halfway mark of the season.

""I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players. I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything,"" added De Zerbi.

""You can't forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.""

Reinforcements needed for threadbare Spurs

For much of the game, this felt like one game too many for Spurs' threadbare squad.

Boss Ange Postecoglou was forced into two changes, with centre-back Christian Romero ruled out for more than a month with a hamstring injury and midfielder Oliver Skipp out with a knock.

For the majority of the match, Spurs' defence was run ragged and the midfield was simply outclassed and outfought by Brighton.

Postecoglou has made no secret of his desire to add defensive reinforcements in the January transfer window and this will only intensify that search, with full-back Emerson Royal struggling centrally and Eric Dier, who was an unused substitute, clearly not fancied.

Spurs did look a threat going forward throughout, but Richarlison was ill-disciplined as he led the line, with the run for his second disallowed goal particularly poorly judged.

Postecoglou will be happy with the late spirit his side showed as Veliz scored his first goal for the club and Davies powered home a back-post header.

They then laid siege to Brighton's goal, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post and Pedro Porro's follow-up being blocked behind, but ultimately they left themselves too much to do.

""It is fair to say we looked like a tired team today,"" Postecoglou told Match of the Day.

""We've asked a lot of these players for a very long time and we lacked a little bit of energy today. They are a good team and we struggled to cope with them.

""We hung in there and that's all you can ask for, they left everything out there.""

Virat Kohli's defiant 76 failed to save India from being thrashed by an innings and 32 runs by South Africa in the first Test at Centurion.

India lost seven second-innings wickets in the evening session as they were bowled out for just 131 in 34.1 overs.

Kohli and Shubman Gill (26) were the only India batters into double figures as Nandre Burger (4-33) and Marco Jansen (3-36) did the damage.

The second and final Test starts on 3 January at Newlands in Cape Town.

India captain Rohit Sharma said his side's performance after a defeat inside three days was ""not good enough"" and they ""failed"" to ""come together collectively"".

""Guys have come here before, we understand what to expect from the conditions. Every individual has his own plan,"" Rohit said.

""Our batters were challenged at different times. We didn't adapt well. We didn't bat well both times which is why we stand here.""

Earlier in the day, South Africa had posted a commanding 408 in response to India's first-innings total of 245.

Dean Elgar, who announced he would retire from international cricket after the series against India, played freely to make a classy 185 while Jansen hit an unbeaten 84.

India were 62-3 at tea with Kagiso Rabada, who took 5-59 in the first innings, capturing the key wicket of India skipper Rohit.

However, the tourists lost seven wickets for just 59 runs in the evening session as South Africa's seamers ran through their middle order.

Kohli made a determined 76 from 82 balls but he was last man out - caught brilliant by Rabada off Jansen - as extras third top-scored for India with eight runs.

Player of the match Elgar said: ""You need fast bowlers and a spinner, potentially, to take 20 wickets. You need guys firing.

""Kagiso Rabada was amazing, and a guy like Nandre just came to the fore. It was a really great team performance.""

Manu Tuilagi played six matches for England at the 2023 Rugby World Cup

Centre Manu Tuilagi is expected to miss the start of England's Six Nations campaign with a groin injury.

Tuilagi suffered a grade three tear in the second half of Sale's 22-20 Premiership win over Saracens at the Salford Community Stadium last Friday.

The 32-year-old, capped 60 times by England, was plagued by a long-term groin problem earlier in his career.

Tuilagi is likely to miss England's opening Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on 3 February.

They will then face Wales at Twickenham the following week.

Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson said Tuilagi's injury would not require surgery and that the player himself was determined to get fit as soon as possible.

""Manu has pulled his groin and we think he's going to be back during the Six Nations, but not for the first week,"" Sanderson said.

""Six weeks is the recommended time for the injury and Manu is saying four. I spoke to him and he's like, 'I need to play and if I'm good to play it's up to England regarding selection'.

""He was in the frame before and I've stated before his intent to keep playing international rugby.""

Hugo Lloris began his career at Nice before joining Lyon in 2008 and then Tottenham in 2012

Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is in talks to join Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC on a free transfer, ending 11 years in north London.

Lloris came close to leaving Spurs in the summer and was in talks with Lazio, but a deal was not completed.

The 37-year-old has been behind Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster and has not played since a 6-1 loss to Newcastle in April.

He has made 447 appearances for Spurs since signing from Lyon in 2012.

The former France international, who is about to enter the final six months of his contract, expressed a desire to leave Tottenham in the summer and was also left out of the club's pre-season tour of Australia and the Far East.

Lloris has kept 151 clean sheets during his time in north London and was part of the Tottenham side that reached the 2019 Champions League final under former boss Mauricio Pochettino.

The former Nice goalkeeper was appointed club captain by Pochettino in 2015 before being replaced by forward Son Heung-min in August.

He was also part of the France side that won the World Cup in 2018 and retired from international football in January having become the country's most-capped player, with 145 international appearances.","Last updated on .From the section TottenhamHugo Lloris began his career at Nice before joining Lyon in 2008 and then Tottenham in 2012Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is in talks to join Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC on a free transfer, ending 11 years in north London.

Today, it is just Little Nicky on The Hill.

In seven months or so, it will be teeming with spectators, sunbathing, sipping and soaking up Wimbledon's atmosphere and giant-screen action.

But now, as autumn turns towards winter, they are gone. The screen is too. And Little Nicky - as the All England Club groundstaff have dubbed their small GPS-guided robotic mower - is alone, trundling up and down the slope, trimming back any new growth.

Little Nicky is not the only difference. Wimbledon has one of sport and summer's most recognisable palettes; sun-bleached whites, electric blue skies, two-tone lawn green and the occasional pop of scarlet strawberry.

In the drizzle and gloom, with the courts stripped back to bare postage stamps of turf and the seats hooded in tarpaulin, it is a more muted colour scheme. Ivy, that blends into the background in the summer, takes centre stage, wrapping Centre Court in a burnt orange.

It feels quiet, but, out of sight, plenty of work is under way.

""For me, it is probably as busy as any time of year,"" says Neil Stubley, head of courts and horticulture.

He has just been at a meeting reviewing July's championships. It was the 28th Wimbledon that Stubley (below) has worked on since his first, as a student, in 1995.

While he also has responsibility for areas like the Hill and Wimbledon Park golf course, which the All England Club bought in 2018, Stubley's primary focus is the same as most fans; the courts.

""Centre Court is probably one of the most scrutinised pieces of turf in the world,"" he says.

""We all come in with eyes wide open, we know what the challenge is.""

By now, he will know more about the challenge for 2024. A 200-page document was set to land in his in-tray shortly before Christmas, postmarked from Bingley, West Yorkshire.

It will contain tens of thousands of data points collected by a team of three specialists from the town's Sports Turf Research Institute. The trio travel down the week before the Championship and test the courts, every morning and evening for the following three.

One test involves dropping a ball in select spots and measuring height of its bounce. In another, they insert a probe to different depths in the soil to collect moisture content readings. One analyst will get on their hands and knees to count the living blades within a wooden quadrant.

Hidden in the data, Stubley and his team will search for clues as to how they might make the grass last a little longer or the ball bounce a bit more consistently next year.

A lot depends on the weather. The key is keeping the surface hard enough for play, while locking in enough moisture lower down for the grass to stay alive.

But other factors are even harder to predict. London's foxes prowl the premises at night and their urine, high in nitrates, can scorch the summer grass.

""If you get a rogue patch going off colour, you can stick your trusty knife in there, give it a sniff, and you will know exactly if a fox has weed on there,"" says Stubley.

""Then you try to dilute it with a load of water, but sometimes the grass will die. Then it is a case of putting down what we call 'groundman's paint' - grass clippings.

""That doesn't affect the play, because the characteristics of the court are in the soil, not the turf.""

Such last-minute touch-ups are far from the mind of Will Brierley, the senior groundsperson who looks after the Championship courts, at the moment.

His task for autumn is the renovation of the courts. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam played on a living surface, and also the only one hosted by a members' club.

The All England Club regulars, who total about 500, play on the outside courts from mid-May though to mid-September.

When the Championships are over, Brierley and his team have to juggle keeping courts available to members while getting the necessary repairs done. Now that the entire season is finished, sunlamps bathe baselines in UV light. But, regardless, nature still holds sway.

""Everything in my day-to-day is dictated by the weather,"" says Brierley, who admits that his lawn at home is ""one quarter artificial turf, three quarters ruined by dogs"".

""Tennis is played on a clay soil so when it rains hard it really restricts what we can do.

""When it is hammering down it is a case of getting on top of tidying the storeroom, auditing machinery, training staff and checking tools.

""It can get a bit tedious and frustrating. This year we had a very wet October and start of November.

""We could have done with another week or so of dry weather. Then I think we would have been exactly where I want us to be.""

Martyn Falconer has a little more freedom from the forecast. As head gardener, he is in charge of the 50,000 plants that decorate the 42-acre site, fulfilling Wimbledon's promise of staging ""tennis in an English garden"".

Whatever the weather, there are hedges to trim, weeds to pull or compost to dig in. Ten thousand bulbs have just been planted. They will emerge, bloom and die back, all unseen by the half a million or more spectators who arrive later in the year during the Championship fortnight.

Weekly deliveries of plants in anticipation of the tournament, all logged in a master spreadsheet by Falconer, begin in early May and continue right up to the start of the Championships in July. The questions - from suppliers and others - start long before.

""The pressure slowly ramps up,"" he says. ""Everyone comes back from Christmas and realises we have got a Championship!

""I have been here long enough to realise what is coming. It feels quite quiet, but it is just brewing…""

Falconer is attempting to stay in front of another trend - the warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers caused by climate change.

""The hotter summers mean we are looking at plants that will work well with less water,"" he says.

""It has certainly got hotter in the 24 years since I started here.

""In previous autumns I would be out on the tools, cutting hedges or tidying leaves and it was really cold. I would be all wrapped up. Now you can get away with just a jacket, you are more worried about staying dry than staying warm.""

However the conditions fluctuate, for many of its fans, Wimbledon is a constant; a manicured corner of England which they can depend on summer after summer, year after year.

""There was a letter a few years ago that sticks in my mind,"" Falconer says.

""It was from someone who comes back every year. She used to enjoy the rose arbour with her husband. He has since died but she still comes back and sits there every year and enjoys it. She just said how it amazing it always looks.

""Little things like that are so nice.""","Wimbledon has one of sport and summer's most recognisable palettes; sun-bleached whites, electric blue skies, two-tone lawn green and the occasional pop of scarlet strawberry.
