Most states run primary contests to nominate a presidential candidate but caucuses have a different process.

Caucuses require party members to attend a location, in person, at a specific time. At schools, community centres and churches across the state, representatives for the candidates make speeches before those present cast their votes by writing down a name.

Most states have moved away from caucuses in favour of primaries, but the Iowa Republican Party - along with those in Nevada, Idaho, Missouri, North Dakota, Hawaii, Wyoming and Kentucky - have all stuck to the system.

The actual prize Republicans are fighting for in Iowa is minimal. Candidates will split a measly 40 delegates, a little more than 1% of the total number in play at the Republican National Convention in July.

But a win for any candidate in Iowa can help energise their campaign at a crucial early stage and potentially propel them to victory in the primaries.

It also marks the first time the country can see how a candidate fares in an actual election, and can generate significant attention in the media.

Watch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 seconds

It was perhaps the least surprising victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.

Donald Trump won by a landslide in the first contest in the Republican race for a presidential nominee, the margin in the end as comfortable as the polls had predicted for months.

But dominating the vote count was just one reason why the former president was celebrating on Monday night after his supporters braved extreme cold weather to deliver him the win.

Neither of Mr Trump's main rivals, Nikki Haley nor Ron DeSantis, emerged as a lead challenger - so the not-Trump vote remains divided. Meanwhile, his most ideologically similar rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, announced he was dropping out - and will endorse Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

Here is a closer look at why the results in Iowa were so significant in the race for the White House.

This is still Donald Trump's party

Mr Trump's victory in Iowa was historically massive. He won the most votes in all but one of Iowa's 99 counties (he lost the other by a single vote).

No one had prevailed in an Iowa contest by more than 12 points before - Mr Trump's margin will approach 30% and he could end up winning an outright majority of the Republicans who turned out.

With almost all the votes counted, Mr Trump had won 51%, with Mr DeSantis on 21% and Ms Haley on 19%.

A survey of Iowans entering caucus sites on Monday night helps explain exactly why his bid for an electoral encore has been successful so far.

About half of Republican caucus-goers consider themselves part of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" movement, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.

Mr Trump's victory was a broad one as well. He won the young and old, men and women. He also won over the evangelical and hard-right conservative voters he had difficulty winning in 2016.

Typically, defeated presidential candidates fade from memory, never able to shake the taint of the loss. Mr Trump, however, has managed to convince Republicans - here in Iowa and nationally - that he didn't lose.

A large majority of caucus-goers in Iowa told CBS they believed Mr Trump was the actual winner of the 2020 presidential election - a number that increased to 90% among Trump supporters.

Trump victory is a remarkable turnaround

Mr Trump's dominant position within the Republican Party has been irrefutable - but his win here, in the larger context of modern American politics, is extraordinary.

Three years ago, he ended his first presidential term under a cloud of controversy, his campaign to challenge his loss to Democrat Joe Biden culminating in the January 6 Capitol riot. He faces two criminal trials stemming from those actions.

Now, as the winner of the Iowa caucuses, he has taken the first significant step toward becoming the Republican Party's nominee in November's presidential election.

Trump still has work to do to become the Republican standard-bearer. He will face a more formidable challenge from Ms Haley in New Hampshire next week, where polls show his once dominating lead has been whittled to near single digits.

But he is still the overwhelming favourite in the race, endorsed in his first test by actual Republican voters.

No clear rival emerged from Iowa

Entering Monday's Iowa caucuses, most of the electoral intrigue involved which candidate would take second place behind Mr Trump. In the end, it was Mr DeSantis who walked away with the runner-up prize.

It's not much of an achievement, however, given the narrowness with which the Florida governor finished ahead of Ms Haley, after investing so much time and resources in Iowa.

The result, and Mr DeSantis's pledge to press on with his campaign, won't provide the kind of clear result that would set up a one-on-one face-off with Trump in the days ahead.

Trump supporters were jubilant

In fact, the result may make Trump's victory all the more potent, as his divide-and-conquer strategy is still fully in place as the Republican primary process kicks into gear.

The one candidate who did drop out, Mr Ramaswamy, will further clear the field for the former president, as public opinion surveys show that his supporters have Mr Trump as their second choice. While he only garnered about 8% in Iowa, every bit of backing counts, and Mr Ramaswamy's endorsement will offer Mr Trump yet another headline to boost him into New Hampshire.

The Iowa result will also let the former president further focus his fire on President Biden, something he eagerly did during his victory speech on Monday night. For their part, the Democrats seem to be welcoming the showdown and the opportunity to exploit what they see as Mr Trump's vulnerabilities.

A series of dominating wins, starting in Iowa, will give the former president momentum, however - and the air of a winner. By the time the autumn general election rolls around, Mr Trump may prove to be a more formidable adversary than they expected - or hoped.","Iowa caucuses: What Trump's dominant win means for his rivalsBy Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent in Des Moines, IowaWatch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 secondsIt was perhaps the least surprising victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.

Watch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 seconds

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has snatched second place in Iowa's caucuses, edging former UN ambassador Nikki Haley into third in a Republican contest dominated by Donald Trump.

Mr DeSantis had campaigned relentlessly in the state but he finished a long way behind the former president.

With nearly all the votes counted, Mr Trump has 51% of the vote, with Mr DeSantis on 21% and Ms Haley on 19%.

Iowa was the first state for Republican voters to make their White House pick.

Their election is called a caucus because people have to show up in person at a certain time in order to cast their vote.

The party's eventual nominee will challenge the Democratic choice, almost certainly President Joe Biden, in November's election.

In a victory party at the state capital Des Moines, Mr Trump hailed a special night and urged Americans to come together to ""straighten out the world"".

Registered Republicans braved sub-zero temperatures to gather on Monday evening across Iowa to cast ballots at churches, schools, gyms and community centres.

Mr Trump had been the overwhelming favourite to win Iowa and Glenn Jacobs, a former WWE wrestler who is campaigning for Mr Trump, had predicted the big win.

Speaking to the BBC an hour before voting began in Des Moines, he said the country was heading in the wrong direction, citing the border crisis and US intervention in the Middle East.

At the same time, across the city, Mr Trump's son Eric told the BBC he hoped his father would wrap up the nomination by Super Tuesday on 3 March, when more than a dozen states will vote.

""We've [the country] become a laughing stock and it's got to stop,"" he said. ""Hopefully it stops in Iowa.""

At a high school in Davenport, in the eastern part of the state, Trump supporter Brian Romer gave an impassioned speech to his fellow Republicans in favour of the former president.

Ron DeSantis said he was happy with second

""The things that happen in this country are things that happen in communist countries,"" he said, referring to Mr Trump's criminal indictments. ""We don't live in a free country anymore.""

But both Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and US ambassador to the UN under President Trump, claimed on Monday night that the political wind was in their sails.

""They threw everything but the kitchen sink at us,"" Mr DeSantis said. ""The media was against us. They were writing our obituary months ago.

""In spite of all of that… we've got our ticket punched out of Iowa.""

Kyle Brock rallied support for Mr DeSantis at a primary school in the Des Moines suburbs, arguing it was time for Republicans to move on from Mr Trump.

""I like his [the Florida governor's] integrity, and the way he presents himself and - really - what he got done in Florida,"" he said.

Mr DeSantis spent most of his time and resources in Iowa, campaigning in all 99 counties and courting the rural state's influential bloc of evangelical voters.

But the conservative Florida governor could face tougher terrain in the more moderate state of New Hampshire, which holds its primary next week.

Ms Haley, who has an outside chance of beating Mr Trump in the state, claimed she had the momentum.

But her third-place finish seemed a disappointment for a candidate who was said to be surging ahead of the caucuses.

Nikki Haley at caucus party

Hallie Still-Caris, at a caucus at a Des Moines high school, said Ms Haley had the best chance to win in November.

""I look at the other Republican candidates and President Biden,"" she said, ""and I think she's electable. That's what we need - less drama and less chaos.""

Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy suspended his presidential campaign after a distant fourth-place finish. He endorsed Mr Trump.

In a post on X, Mr Biden noted that he seemed to be heading for a rematch with Mr Trump.

""But here's the thing: this election was always going to be you and me vs extreme Maga Republicans,"" the Democratic president wrote. ""It was true yesterday and it'll be true tomorrow.""

More on the US election

According to the entrance poll data, Mr Trump won strong support from white evangelicals and very conservative voters.

He also won more broadly among men, women, older voters and younger voters, improving on his 2016 performance with all of these groups.

Mr Trump has consolidated his lead among Republicans in national opinion polls even as he faces four separate criminal trials and two civil trials.","Iowa caucuses: DeSantis edges out Haley as both trail Trump in IowaBy Mike Wendling, Bernd Debusmann Jr & Holly Honderich BBC News, IowaWatch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 secondsFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has snatched second place in Iowa's caucuses, edging former UN ambassador Nikki Haley into third in a Republican contest dominated by Donald Trump.

By Max Matza BBC News

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has dropped out of the presidential race after a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.

""There is no path for me to be the next president absent things that we don't want to see happen in this country,"" he told supporters in Iowa on Monday.

He added that he had spoken to Mr Trump and planned to campaign for him.

His departure further narrows down the field dominated by the ex-president.

On Monday night, Donald Trump finished with an overwhelming lead in Iowa, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in second and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley in third.

Mr Ramaswamy, who finished in the fourth place, was the only candidate of the night to announce his departure from the race after Iowa held its first-in-the-nation vote.

He pledged to put ""an America first candidate in the White House"" and said that he planned to appear at a Trump campaign rally in New Hampshire in the coming days.

""Now, going forward, he will have my full endorsement for the presidency. And I think we're going to do the right thing for this country,"" he said.

""And so I'm going to ask you, to follow me in taking our America First movement to the next level.""

The Harvard and Yale-educated son of Indian immigrants entered the race after making his fortune in the pharmaceutical industry.

The 38-year-old has never held political office and his campaign has at times courted controversy for its endorsement of conspiracy theories.

He promised to end birth-right citizenship and affirmative action and said he would close the Education Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies.

He positioned himself as an outsider willing to develop former President Trump's ""America First"" agenda with his own personal spin. But his campaign was unable to pull much support away from Mr Trump.

Just before Iowa's caucus, Mr Trump offered a rare criticism of Mr Ramaswamy, calling him a ""fraud"" and telling Republicans that a vote for him would be a vote for the ""other side"".

Mr Trump had previously praised the Ohio-native, posting after the fourth Republican debate in December: ""Vivek WINS because he thinks l'm great.""

Mr Ramaswamy has been a steadfast defender of Mr Trump's record on the campaign trail, including after Mr Trump's pre-Iowa attack.","Iowa caucuses 2024: Vivek Ramaswamy suspends campaign and endorses TrumpBy Max Matza BBC NewsReutersEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has dropped out of the presidential race after a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.

Dozens of vessels have been targeted by the Houthis in the Red Sea since November

A Malta-flagged, Greek-owned vessel has been hit with a missile in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, maritime security firm Ambrey has said.

It is thought to be the third incident involving the bulk carrier, believed to be named Zografia, in 24 hours.

Tuesday's incident comes as the US military announced it had seized Iranian-supplied weapons bound for the Houthis during an operation last week.

Meanwhile, the US has hit more targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

An official told CBS, the BBC's American partner, that the US conducted further strikes on Houthi positions overnight.

The US and UK launched a wave of airstrikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January following attacks by the Iran-backed group on shipping in the Red Sea.

It is not yet known what was attacked in the latest US operation.

The Houthis have vowed to retaliate and on Sunday the US said it had shot down a missile fired towards one of its warships from a Houthi area of Yemen.

Several vessels have been targeted by the movement's fighters since November in protest at Israel's war with Hamas.

The Houthis say they are targeting vessels which are Israeli-owned, flagged or operated, or are heading to Israeli ports. However, many have no connections with Israel.

The Red Sea connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal but several shipping lines have announced they are now diverting round the Cape of Good Hope to reach Europe instead.

US Central Command

The US said on Tuesday that analysis from the weapons it seized from a ship near the Yemen coast suggested the Houthis had been using the same kind of weapons in their Red Sea attacks.

The seizure took place on 11 January near the coast of Somalia - the same day as the first US-UK airstrikes.

Cruise and ballistic missile components were among the items found on a ship, as well as parts for air defence equipment.

""This is the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons (ACW) to the Houthis since the beginning of Houthi attacks against merchant ships in November 2023,"" US Central Command said in a statement.

It also said a search is continuing for two Navy Seals who were lost overboard during the operation.","Red Sea attacks: Greek vessel hit by missile - reportsBy Kathryn Armstrong BBC NewsGetty ImagesDozens of vessels have been targeted by the Houthis in the Red Sea since NovemberA Malta-flagged, Greek-owned vessel has been hit with a missile in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, maritime security firm Ambrey has said.

By George Wright & David Gritten BBC News

AFP

Authorities in Iraq's Kurdistan Region said four people were killed in the overnight strikes

The US has condemned Iran over ballistic missile strikes on Iraq's northern city of Irbil on Monday night, calling them ""reckless and imprecise"".

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they struck what they claimed were an Israeli ""spy headquarters"" in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region.

Four civilians were killed and six hurt in the attack, local authorities said.

Iraq recalled its ambassador from Tehran, condemning the strikes as a ""blatant violation"" of sovereignty.

There has been no comment from Israel.

The Revolutionary Guards also said they carried out missile strikes on ""terrorist bases"" in Syria in response to a recent suicide bombing in Iran claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.

In a separate development on Tuesday morning, Kurdish counter-terrorism forces said they had shot three armed drones flying over Irbil's airport, where US and international forces are stationed, Reuters news agency reported.

There was no immediate claim, but an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has said it was behind similar attacks.

The Iranian strikes come amid heightened tensions across the Middle East since the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas began on 7 October.

Iran has declared that it does not want to get involved in a wider conflict, but groups in its so-called ""Axis of Resistance"" have been carrying out attacks on Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians.

Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has exchanged cross-border fire with Israeli forces; Shia militias have launched drones and missiles at US forces in Iraq and Syria; and Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked ships in the Red Sea.

Israel has reportedly carried out strikes that killed a Hamas leader in Lebanon and a Revolutionary Guards commander in Syria, while the US has killed an Iraqi militia leader in an air strike in Iraq and bombed Houthi targets in Yemen.

Iraq's government condemned Iran's ""aggression"" on Irbil

The Kurdistan Region Security Council said multiple ballistic missiles launched by the Revolutionary Guards struck civilian-populated areas of Irbil around 23:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday.

Local news outlet Rudaw reported that loud explosions shook the city and that several residential buildings on the road between Irbil and the north-eastern suburb of Pirmam were damaged heavily.

Peshraw Dizayee, a multimillionaire real estate magnate, was killed when a missile hit his home, the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party said.

An 11-month-old baby was also among the dead, according to Rudaw.

The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that the missile strikes were a ""response to the recent evil acts of the Zionist regime in martyring [Revolutionary Guards] and resistance commanders"".

The missiles ""destroyed one of the main headquarters of Israel's spy agency Mossad in Iraq's Kurdistan Region"", which had been used to ""develop espionage operations and plan acts of terrorism"", they claimed.

However, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said it categorically rejected ""this unfounded pretext"" and accused the Revolutionary Guards of frequently employing ""baseless pretexts for assaulting Irbil"" when it posed no threat.

The Kurdistan Region's Prime Minister, Masrour Barzani, condemned the ""cowardly attack"" and urged the federal government in Baghdad to ""to take a principled position against the flagrant violation of Iraq's and the Kurdistan Region's sovereignty"".

The Iraqi foreign ministry said the government ""strongly denounced the Iranian aggression on Irbil"" and would ""take all legal measures against it"", including filing a complaint to the UN Security Council. It also announced the formation of an investigative committee to ""prove the falsity"" of Iran's claims.

Later, the ministry recalled the Iraqi ambassador from Tehran for consultations and summoned Iran's charge d'affaires in Baghdad to protest.

""We will continue to assess the situation, but initial indications are that this was a reckless and imprecise set of strikes,"" Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement.

""The United States supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq,"" she said, adding that no US personnel or facilities were targeted.

The UN mission in Iraq said: ""Attacks, by any side, violating Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity must stop. Security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.""

The Iranian foreign ministry said it respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries but was using its ""legitimate and legal right to deter national security threats"".

In 2022, the Revolutionary Guards carried out a similar missile attack on what it claimed was an Israeli ""strategic centre"" in Irbil following an air strike in Syria that killed two senior Iranian officers. Later in the year, they hit what they said were the bases of Iranian Kurdish opposition groups in the region.

The Revolutionary Guards also said they had targeted the positions of IS and other ""terrorist groups"" in Syria's opposition-controlled Idlib province on Monday night.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said it was not clear where the missiles landed. Four explosions were heard south-east of the city of Aleppo, within areas controlled by Iran-backed militias, and one blast was heard near the city of Idlib, it added.

White Helmets first responders said a non-functioning medical clinic in the village of Taltita in Idlib province had been destroyed by explosions of unknown origin. Two people suffered minor injuries, they added.

The Revolutionary Guards said the strikes in Syria were in retaliation for this month's suicide bombing that targeted crowds marking the fourth anniversary of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's assassination by the US.","US condemns Iran for 'reckless' missile strikes on northern IraqBy George Wright & David Gritten BBC NewsAFPAuthorities in Iraq's Kurdistan Region said four people were killed in the overnight strikesThe US has condemned Iran over ballistic missile strikes on Iraq's northern city of Irbil on Monday night, calling them ""reckless and imprecise"".

Watch: Top moments from this year's Emmy Awards ceremony

Succession, Beef and The Bear were the big winners at the Emmy Awards, which took place on Monday in Los Angeles.

Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen all took home acting prizes for Succession, while the show also won best drama series overall.

Creator Jesse Armstrong said it was ""a great sadness to end the show, but it was a great pleasure to do it"".

Also at the ceremony, Sir Elton John won his first Emmy Award, finally giving him EGOT status.

That means he has joined an exclusive club of performers who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award.

Sir Elton missed the ceremony because he has recently had knee surgery

Elton Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium won best live variety special, marking the British singer-songwriter's first Emmy nomination and award.

However, Sir Elton could not pick up the honour after having a knee operation. He wrote on Instagram that he was ""on cloud nine"" after the win and joked that his knee problem was ""a gentle reminder, perhaps, of a lifetime spent jumping off pianos"".

He added: ""Honoured to have joined the hallowed ranks of EGOT winners, here's to the joy of music and the magic it brings to our lives!""

Other winners on the night included The White Lotus and Abbott Elementary.

Succession, the critically acclaimed drama about a media mogul and the power struggles between his dysfunctional family, concluded last year after four seasons.

It was rewarded generously at the Emmys, winning best drama series and prizes for writing and directing, while Snook and Culkin won best leading drama actress and actor for playing Shiv and Roman Roy respectively.

""The bar was set so high and that was what spurred us on,"" Snook said of Succession's success.

She also thanked her parents, telling them: ""Mum and dad - thank you for having a dress-up box when I was a kid, this is where it gets you!""

Snook dedicated the award to her daughter, commenting: ""The biggest thank you I think though is to someone who won't understand anything that I'm saying at the moment, but I carried her with me in this last season and really it was her who carried me.

""It's very easy to act when you're pregnant because you've got hormones raging and it was more that the proximity of her life growing inside me gave me the strength to do this and this performance.""

Co-star Culkin paid tribute to Armstrong ""for being a brilliant writer, showrunner and gentleman"".

Culkin also thanked his two children and wife, before addressing her from the stage: ""And Jazz, I want more [children]. You said maybe, if I won!""

He beat fellow Succession stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, who had also been nominated in the best drama actor category.

In his own acceptance speech, British actor Macfadyen, who played Shiv's husband Tom, joked: ""I must make special mention to my on-screen wife Sarah Snook, and my other on-screen wife Nicholas Braun.""

Braun, a fellow nominee, plays Cousin Greg in Succession, and the two characters' relationship was a favourite with viewers.

""Acting with you has been one of the most wonderful things in my career, so thank you Nick, thank you Sarah,"" Macfadyen added.

Armstrong, the Shropshire-born screenwriter who created the series, also scooped the top prize for best writing in a drama series.

In his speech, Armstrong referred back to the show's main plotline, joking: ""For some reason, the name of a certain Australia-born media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, springs to mind.""

He added: ""I come from the UK and the show is about things that are close to the centre of American life and politics, and we've always been met with generosity and good faith and that's part of America's tradition of being very welcoming to outsiders.""

Elsewhere, The Bear - a comedy-drama series about a chef who returns home to run his family's sandwich shop - won three acting prizes, for its star Jeremy Allen White, and supporting actors Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.

Accepting his award, White said: ""I am so full of gratitude to be standing in front of you all - I love this show so much, it filled me up, set a fire in me.""

Edebiri told the audience: ""This is a show about found family and real family, and my parents are here tonight - thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and black and proud of all of that.""

Succession and The Bear won six prizes each in the drama and comedy categories respectively, while Netflix's road rage-inspired series Beef dominated the limited series categories.

Josef Fritzl kept his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her

Josef Fritzl, the Austrian sex offender who locked his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her, could be moved from a high-security prison, local media reports.

Fritzl, now 88, was jailed for life in 2009 in a case that shocked the world.

Austrian public broadcaster ORF reports that a new psychiatric report on Fritzl, who has dementia, says he no longer poses a danger to the public.

It means a court may now decide whether to move him to a normal prison.

Fritzl is being held in a high-security institution for mentally disturbed offenders in Stein Prison, in the town of Krems an der Donau.

In Austria, those sentenced to life in prison can apply for conditional release after serving 15 years - under this law, Fritzl is eligible for parole this year.

Legal experts say conditional release is also a possibility, which means Fritzl, who has since changed his name, could be moved into a care home.

It is ""quite obvious that a dismissal will be announced"", Alois Birklbauer, professor of criminal law at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, told ORF.

In 2022, a regional court ruled Fritzl was ""no longer a danger"" and could be moved to a standard jail - but the Higher Regional Court in Vienna later blocked the decision.

The Fritzl case, which emerged in the town of Amstetten in 2008, has been described as one of the worst in Austria's criminal history.

He was convicted of murdering one of his children through neglect, as well as rape, incest, and enslaving his daughter.","Josef Fritzl could be moved to care home - reportsBy Bethany Bell BBC News in ViennaGetty ImagesJosef Fritzl kept his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with herJosef Fritzl, the Austrian sex offender who locked his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her, could be moved from a high-security prison, local media reports.

By Kathryn Armstrong BBC News

Golriz Ghahraman is a former United Nations human rights lawyer

A New Zealand MP has resigned following multiple allegations of shoplifting, which police are investigating.

Golriz Ghahraman, of the Green Party, is alleged to have stolen three times from two clothing stores - one in Auckland and the other in Wellington.

The former UN human rights lawyer made history in 2017 as the first refugee in the country's government. She once held her party's justice portfolio.

Work-related stress made her behave completely out of character, she said.

""I have let down a lot of people and I am very sorry,"" she added.

Ms Ghahraman fled Iran as a child with her family, who were all granted political asylum in New Zealand.

Her resignation on Tuesday comes after CCTV footage emerged showing her allegedly taking a designer handbag from an Auckland boutique.

The 42-year-old, who has not been charged with any crime, said in a statement her actions had ""fallen short"" of the high standards of behaviour the public expected from elected representatives.

""It's not a behaviour I can explain because it's not rational in any way, and after medical evaluation, I understand I'm not well,"" she said, adding that she did not want to make excuses for herself.

""The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma.""

Responding to her resignation, Green Party co-leader James Shaw said that Ms Ghahraman had been subject to ""pretty much continuous threats of sexual violence, physical violence, death threats since the day she was elected to Parliament"".

""That has added a higher level of stress than is experienced by most members of parliament,"" he said.

""There have been police investigations into those threats almost the entire time that she has been a member of parliament, and so obviously if you're living with that level of threat in what is already quite a stressful situation then there are going to be consequences for that"".

Ms Ghahraman has spoken out in the past about the abuse she has received both online and in person based on her Iranian heritage, her gender and the public stances she has taken on various issues.

""Eventually some of the online threats I faced got to the point where I had to carry a security alarm and have security escorts back and forth from Parliament,"" she told national broadcaster TVNZ in 2021.

In 2017, Ms Ghahraman was given an escort following threats by white supremacists.

More recently, she has been criticised for taking part in pro-Palestinian protests and for being critical of Israel's military actions in its war against Hamas in Gaza in her role as the Green Party's foreign affairs and human rights spokesperson.

Fellow Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said it was right that Ms Ghahraman had resigned but that it was clear she was in distress and would continue to receive their support.","Golriz Ghahraman: New Zealand MP resigns following shoplifting allegationsBy Kathryn Armstrong BBC NewsGetty ImagesGolriz Ghahraman is a former United Nations human rights lawyerA New Zealand MP has resigned following multiple allegations of shoplifting, which police are investigating.

By Lora Jones Business reporter, BBC News

Uniqlo's nylon cross-body bag has been a huge hit online

Uniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast fashion giant is selling copycats of its viral ""Mary Poppins"" shoulder bag.

The legal case filed in Tokyo alleges that some Shein bags ""closely resemble"" Uniqlo's own and could dent customer confidence in the brand.

Uniqlo's cross-body bag has been a huge hit online, with TikTokkers showing off how many items they can fit in it.

Shein did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Uniqlo is demanding that Shein stops selling its version of the bag immediately, as well as asking for ""compensation for damages incurred"".

Uniqlo's owner, Fast Retailing, said on Tuesday that a petition had been filed in the Tokyo District Court against Shein Japan and two subsidiaries in late December.

Videos of the bag have generated millions of ""likes"" online over the past year, with one jokey post showing a user taking out a laptop, water bottle, candle and even a robot vacuum and toolkit.

It has been likened to the magical carpet bag carried by Mary Poppins who, in the eponymous 1964 musical, pulls a hat stand and lampshade out of her holdall.

The nylon ""round mini shoulder bag"", costing £14.90 in the UK, has reportedly become the brand's best-selling bag ever.

Shein, founded in 2008 in China, saw sales surge during the pandemic, fuelled by a jump in online shopping and its social media-focussed marketing strategy.

According to its website, the company employs nearly 10,000 people worldwide and sells to more than 150 countries.

It is now based in Singapore and reports have been circulating that it is considering a stock exchange listing in New York.

It has, however, attracted controversy. Low prices have raised questions about the company's environmental footprint and employment practices, but Shein says it produces clothes in small batches, which is more efficient and means little goes to waste, and that it has zero tolerance policy on forced labour.

It has also seen accusations made online by smaller business owners over claims that their products have been copied by the fashion giant, although it has said that it ""respects designers and artists, and the intellectual property rights of others"".

Fast Retailing, Japan's biggest clothing seller, opened the first Uniqlo store in 1984 and now operates some 2,500 around the world, many of them in China.

Uniqlo has gained a reputation for practical clothes offered up in a number of different colours, with a focus on thermals and coats in particular.

In its latest financial update, Uniqlo's owner reported profits of 146.7 billion yen (£791m) in the three months to the end of November, compared with 117.1bn yen a year before which has been fuelled by overseas sales.","Uniqlo sues Shein over claims firm copied viral shoulder bagBy Lora Jones Business reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesUniqlo's nylon cross-body bag has been a huge hit onlineUniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast fashion giant is selling copycats of its viral ""Mary Poppins"" shoulder bag.

Rees-Zammit move 'a bit of a rollercoaster' - Wales boss Gatland

Wales and Gloucester winger Louis Rees-Zammit is to leave rugby union with immediate effect to pursue a career in the NFL.

The 22-year-old, who has been capped 32 times by his country, described the decision to join the NFL international player pathway (IPP) as ""painstaking"".

Rees-Zammit is aiming to secure a place on an American football team for 2024.

""I am extremely excited to take up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue a new challenge,"" he said.

Rees-Zammit said the move did not necessarily mean he was retiring from rugby.

""Rather at this age and stage of my life I am excited to explore a unique challenge that has the potential to diversify my skillset,"" he said.

Rees-Zammit broke into the Gloucester team as a teenager before making his debut for Wales in October 2020.

He has since become one of the team's star players, scoring five tries at last autumn's World Cup as Wales reached the quarter-finals.

But he will now travel to Florida this week to start on the IPP - a 10-week programme which gives athletes from around the world the chance to earn a spot on an NFL roster. The 2024 NFL season is due to begin in early September.

Rees-Zammit will not now be part of the Wales squad for the Six Nations, which was named soon after his announcement.

He also steps away from Gloucester, who have been his only professional club and he said were ""extremely close to my heart"".

Rees-Zammit said he had ""immense gratitude"" towards Gloucester - particularly head coach George Skivington and chief executive Alex Brown.

""My best wishes go to Wales for the upcoming Six Nations and the year ahead, while I will continue to closely follow the continued progress of Gloucester from afar,"" he added.

News 'a bit of a shock' for Gatland

Wales head coach Warren Gatland said he learned of the news only an hour before it was announced.

""It's a little bit of a shock,"" said Gatland. ""He rang me to let me know and give me that information, say thanks very much for his time at the World Cup and how he enjoyed it.

""I wished him all the best. I honestly hope it all works out for him.""

Rees-Zammit has made eight appearances for Gloucester this season, scoring four tries, including a stunning effort in their European Challenge Cup win at Edinburgh last weekend.

He had been linked with a move to a French Top 14 club for next season.

""We understand the size of the opportunity before Zam and his lifelong ambition to play in the NFL,"" said Brown.

""Whilst we are naturally sad to see him leave, ultimately, we are not able to dissuade him from taking an opportunity of this magnitude with the NFL.""

Rees Zammit became Gloucester's youngest-ever player in the Premiership when he made his debut for them aged 18

'Now is the perfect time'

Rees-Zammit has been considered one of Welsh rugby's brightest young prospects since he burst onto the scene and scored his first international try against Georgia in November 2020, with his pace helping to make him one of the game's most exciting wingers.

He has played in the past three Six Nations for Wales before appearing in his first World Cup in France in September.

In 2021, he was a member of the British and Irish Lions' squad for their tour of South Africa and played in four matches.

He became Gloucester's youngest player in Premiership history when he made his first appearance aged 18, going on to feature 77 times for the side.

""I'm only 22 now and I've done quite a bit in rugby,"" Rees-Zammit said in an interview with Gloucester.

""The international player pathway is in January and it just so happens the Six Nations is in February, and I think now is the perfect time with my age and having to pick up a new sport.

""It's nothing about rugby, it's about my ambition to make my dream come true and play in the NFL.

""As a little boy my dad has always brought me up to be a big NFL fan and growing up he used to play American football, so it's kind of to continue his legacy and hopefully go beyond and make him proud.""

Can Rees-Zammit succeed in NFL where others have failed?

Rees-Zammit is not the first player to move from the Premiership to the NFL - but so far nobody has managed to make an impact on the game.

Former England and Wasps winger Christian Wade joined the Buffalo Bills under the IPP programme in 2019.

He scored a a 65-yard touchdown on his debut for the Bills in pre-season but never made a regular season appearance.

He was third on the all-time Premiership try-scoring list with 82 tries when he was cut by the Bills in 2022.

Lock Christian Scotland-Williamson left Worcester in 2017 to go down a similar route - with the aim of being a tight end.

But after three years trying to make the Pittsburgh Steelers' roster, he too returned having not played a regular season match.

He joined Harlequins in 2021 and featured in two Premiership Rugby Cup ties.

Team GB discus thrower Lawrence Okoye had a bit more time in the NFL - but no more regular season minutes.

Having been crowned European Under-23 champion in 2011 and reaching the final at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, he took part in the 2013 NFL Combine and entered that year's draft.

Despite not being drafted he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers, where he spent two years.

He went on to have spells on the practice squads at the Arizona Cardinals, the New York Jets, the Dallas Cowboys, the Chicago Bears and the Miami Dolphins between 2015 and 2017.

He returned to athletics and won silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

'Turbulence' continues for Welsh rugby

Analysis - BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones

This news has come out of absolutely nowhere, with Wales boss Warren Gatland only hearing about it minutes before naming his Six Nations squad.

Having won 32 Wales caps by the age of 22, Rees-Zammit was one of the hottest properties in the game - and his shock departure from the sport is a major blow.

However, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and by switching at such a young age he has given himself both the option to return to rugby later on, as well as a better chance of cracking the NFL, which is such a daunting prospect.

After a rollercoaster 2023 for Welsh rugby, the turbulence shows no sign of letting up in 2024.","Last updated on .From the section Rugby UnionRees-Zammit move 'a bit of a rollercoaster' - Wales boss GatlandWales and Gloucester winger Louis Rees-Zammit is to leave rugby union with immediate effect to pursue a career in the NFL.

The world's most popular YouTuber, MrBeast, has shared a full video on X for the first time, having previously said even a ""billion views"" would not make it worth his while.

The star has previously only made his material available to his 231 million subscribers on YouTube.

MrBeast said he is now trying X because he is ""super curious"" how much advertising revenue it will make.

His U-turn is a boost for the struggling social media platform.

Owner Elon Musk has tried various strategies to boost the business - previously known as Twitter - since buying it in October 2022.

These include sharing advertising revenue with high profile creators, something that other sites, including YouTube, already do.

The amount so-called influencers can make varies from person to person. The terms of individual deals are kept confidential though it is thought the biggest names may be able to negotiate special rates.

MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, said he would publicly reveal the money he made from the X video, which picked up 33 million views in just 10 hours, in a week's time.

However, it has some way to go to beat the total audience it gained on the previous platform, where it has been viewed 211 million times since it was posted in September 2023.

Regardless, it amounts to a significant change of heart for MrBeast, who previously said it was not worth his time to post videos to X, as ""even if they got a billion views"" it wouldn't cover the cost.

MrBeast has claimed that his YouTube videos cost millions of dollars to make. But he has also earned a fortune. In November 2022, Forbes estimated that he made $54m (£42.5m) in a year from YouTube.

Since then, he has gained 120 million more subscribers on his main channel.

Those kinds of figures mean it is a boon for X to host MrBeast's content.

But there is no guarantee he will replicate his success on YouTube, as demonstrated by the recent deal struck by US celebrity Paris Hilton, which was pulled after just four weeks.

The amount of advertising revenue creators can make may also be affected by Mr Musk's feud with advertisers, some of whom he has a rocky relationship with. Last year, he swore at the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger, during a live event after the entertainment giant pulled its advertising from X.

X has also been marred by accusations that it is allowing hate speech on the platform - which it vociferously denies - and unlike some of the celebrities Mr Musk has previously endorsed on X, MrBeast has a wholesome image.

He is known for his charity work and giving away money, while Kris, a member of his production team who regularly appears in videos, came out as trans in 2023.

Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie has been in custody since April

A suspected Kenyan cult leader is to be charged with murder and terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 people found in mass graves, prosecutors say.

Paul Mackenzie was arrested in April after the discovery of hundreds of bodies, some of whom were said to have starved themselves to death.

Kenyan prosecutors say that he and 94 others will be charged in court in Malindi on Wednesday.

The self-proclaimed pastor has denied responsibility for the deaths.

The bodies of 429 people, including children, have been dug up from grave sites in Shakahola, a remote forest about two hours' drive west of Malindi. Most showed signs of starvation, but some - children among them - may have been assaulted.

Mr Mackenzie is alleged to have encouraged members of his Good News International Church to move there and prepare for the end of the world.

One witness told the BBC that people were given instructions in January last year to begin fasting so that they could ""get to heaven"".

But Mr Mackenzie has said the deaths could not be down to him as he closed his church in 2019.

Several mass grave sites were found in Shakahola forest

Investigators had asked for his time in custody to be extended several times as they continued their investigation.

They said their inquiries had now gathered enough evidence to charge him and the others with offences including murder, assault and ""facilitating the commission of a terrorist act"".

They are also facing a charge of ""subjecting a child to torture"", according to a statement from the director of public prosecutions.

The charges were listed a week after the court gave the prosecutors a fortnight's deadline to make them public or face the possibility that the suspects could be released.

Out of the 95 suspects, 64 had been found in Shakahola and were initially treated as victims and moved to a rescue centre.

However, investigators later found that many of them had children who had died in the forest.

Some of them had given false names and identities and failed to account for their children.","Kenya cult leader Paul Mackenzie faces terror charges over mass deathsGetty ImagesSelf-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie has been in custody since AprilA suspected Kenyan cult leader is to be charged with murder and terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 people found in mass graves, prosecutors say.

Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie has been in custody since April

A suspected Kenyan cult leader is to be charged with murder and terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 people found in mass graves, prosecutors say.

Paul Mackenzie was arrested in April after the discovery of hundreds of bodies, some of whom were said to have starved themselves to death.

Kenyan prosecutors say that he and 94 others will be charged in court in Malindi on Wednesday.

The self-proclaimed pastor has denied responsibility for the deaths.

The bodies of 429 people, including children, have been dug up from grave sites in Shakahola, a remote forest about two hours' drive west of Malindi. Most showed signs of starvation, but some - children among them - may have been assaulted.

Mr Mackenzie is alleged to have encouraged members of his Good News International Church to move there and prepare for the end of the world.

One witness told the BBC that people were given instructions in January last year to begin fasting so that they could ""get to heaven"".

But Mr Mackenzie has said the deaths could not be down to him as he closed his church in 2019.

Several mass grave sites were found in Shakahola forest

Investigators had asked for his time in custody to be extended several times as they continued their investigation.

They said their inquiries had now gathered enough evidence to charge him and the others with offences including murder, assault and ""facilitating the commission of a terrorist act"".

They are also facing a charge of ""subjecting a child to torture"", according to a statement from the director of public prosecutions.

The charges were listed a week after the court gave the prosecutors a fortnight's deadline to make them public or face the possibility that the suspects could be released.

Out of the 95 suspects, 64 had been found in Shakahola and were initially treated as victims and moved to a rescue centre.

However, investigators later found that many of them had children who had died in the forest.

Some of them had given false names and identities and failed to account for their children.","Kenya cult leader Paul Mackenzie faces terror charges over mass deathsGetty ImagesSelf-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie has been in custody since AprilA suspected Kenyan cult leader is to be charged with murder and terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 people found in mass graves, prosecutors say.

By Oliver Slow BBC News

Reuters

Kim Jong Un met Russian leader Vladimir Putin in September

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said unification with the South is no longer possible, and that the constitution should be changed to designate it the ""principal enemy"".

Mr Kim also said three organisations dealing with reunification would shut down, state media KCNA reported.

South Korea's president said it would respond ""multiple times stronger"" to any provocation from the North.

The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953.

They did not sign a peace treaty and therefore have remained technically still at war ever since.

In a speech delivered at the Supreme People's Assembly - North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament - Mr Kim said that the constitution should be amended to educate North Koreans that South Korea is a ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy"".

He also said that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the country's constitution should reflect the issue of ""occupying"", ""recapturing"" and ""incorporating"" the South into its territory.

Mr Kim - who replaced his father, Kim Jong-il, as North Korean leader in 2011 - said the North ""did not want war, but we also have no intention of avoiding it"", according to KCNA.

He said he was taking a ""new stand"" on north-south relations, which included dismantling all organisations tasked with reunification.

Speaking to his cabinet on Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that if the North carried out a provocation, the South ""will retaliate multiple times stronger"", pointing to the South Korean military's ""overwhelming response capabilities"".

Dr John Nilsson-Wright, who heads the Japan and Koreas Programme at Cambridge University's Centre for Geopolitics, described Mr Kim's remarks as ""unprecedented"", and said it was ""highly unusual"" for a North Korean leader to depart from the policy of unification.

""It's not unusual for relations between the North and South to cool, but this has taken the relationship in a different direction,"" he told the BBC.

He added that Mr Kim's anti-Western stance can be traced back to the 2019 summit with then-US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, which ended without an agreement.

""This has been an acute disappointment and loss of face for Kim,"" Dr Nilsson-Wright said.

Heightened tensions

Mr Kim's comments came as relations significantly weakened on the Korean Peninsula in recent months.

In November, North Korea fully suspended a five-year military deal with the South aimed at lowering military tensions. It promised to withdraw all measures ""taken to prevent military conflict in all spheres including ground, sea and air"", and said it would deploy more forces to the border region.

The South had partly suspended the agreement days earlier after Mr Kim claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space.

The rhetoric - and provocative actions - from the North have only escalated since then.

At year-end policy meetings, Mr Kim said he needed to ""newly formulate"" the North's stance towards inter-Korean relations and reunification policy, adding that the stated goal was to ""make a decisive policy change"" related to ""the enemy"".

He also threatened a nuclear attack on the South, and called for a build-up of his country's military arsenal.

The North has also launched missiles in recent weeks, as well as live-fire exercises close to South Korean territory.

In a report published last week for 38 North, a US-based organisation with a focus on North Korea, former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried S Hecker said they saw the situation on the Korean Peninsula as ""more dangerous than it has ever been"" since the start of the Korean War in 1950.

""That may sound overly dramatic, but we believe that, like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" it said.

""We do not know when or how Kim plans to pull the trigger, but the danger is already far beyond the routine warnings in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo about Pyongyang's 'provocations'.""

It added that it did not see the ""war preparation themes"" in North Korean media as ""typical bluster"".

Dr Nilsson-Wright agreed and said the ""risk of escalation should be taken seriously"".

Tendulkar is the latest Indian celebrity to be targeted by deepfakes

Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has criticised a deepfake video in which he seems to be promoting an online gaming app.

The video shows him praising the app as a quick way to make money.

""These videos are fake. It is disturbing to see rampant misuse of technology,"" he posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Tendulkar is the latest Indian celebrity to speak up against deepfake videos.

A few months ago, actress Rashmika Mandanna urged people not to share such material after a deepfake video of hers went viral. The video, which had Mandanna's face morphed onto an Instagram video posted by a British-Indian woman, sparked a conversation in India about the misuse of technology.

The actress, who called the incident ""extremely scary"", had asked girls to speak up if this happened to them.

Other Indian actresses such as Alia Bhatt, Kajol and Katrina Kaif have also been targeted by deepfake videos.

In Tendulkar's case, the video also showed him saying that his daughter used the gaming app regularly.

""Social media platforms need to be alert and responsive to complaints. Swift action from their end is crucial to stopping the spread of misinformation and deepfakes,"" the iconic batsman wrote.

Tendulkar, one of India's most-loved cricketers who retired in 2013, endorses several top brands.

Responding to Tendulkar's post, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India's junior minister for information technology (IT), said that ""deepfakes and misinformation powered by AI"" threatened the safety of internet users.

He added that India will soon notify strict rules to ensure that social media platforms took down deepfake videos immediately.

Under India's IT rules, social media platforms have to ensure that ""no misinformation is posted by any user"". Platforms that do not comply could be taken to court under Indian law.

Mr Chandrasekhar and federal IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw have spoken up against deepfakes earlier.

In November, Mr Vaishnaw had chaired a meeting with social media platforms and artificial intelligence companies where he said the government would soon come up with a ""clear, actionable plan"" to tackle deepfakes.

A court artist's sketch of the two brothers appearing at the Palais de Justice in Geneva

Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.

At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.

On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.

They will be sentenced on Tuesday.

Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.

He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.

""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.

""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""

Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.

A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.

The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.

A Doucai-style wine cup stolen from the museum remains missing

Around 3.5m Swiss francs (£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.

On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.

Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.

The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.

""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""

Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.

The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".

She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.

The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.","Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heistBy Thomas Mackintosh BBC News, in GenevaPatrick TondeuxA court artist's sketch of the two brothers appearing at the Palais de Justice in GenevaProsecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.

By Jonathan Amos Science correspondent

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Richard Sidey

Wave action is cutting caves and arches in the walls of A23a

Erosion is sculpting dramatic features into the world's biggest iceberg in what's likely to be the final months of its existence.

A ship run by the Eyos expeditions company arrived at the frozen behemoth, A23a, on Sunday to find huge caves and arches cut into its frozen walls.

The berg is being ground down by the warmer air and surface waters it's encountering as it drifts slowly away from the White Continent.

Ultimately, it will melt and disappear.

""We saw waves, a good 3m or 4m high, smashing into the berg,"" said expedition leader Ian Strachan.

""These were creating cascades of ice - a constant state of erosion,"" he told BBC News.

Copernicus Data/Esa/Sentinel-3

Pictured from space: A23a is about 200km west of the South Orkney Islands, partially covered here by cloud

A23a broke away from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but it's only recently begun a big migration.

For more than 30 years, it was stuck rigidly in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea, like a static ""ice island"" measuring some 4,000 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in area. That's more than twice the size of Greater London.

The colossus is presently drifting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the great sweep of water that circles the continent in a clockwise direction.

This current, together with the prevailing westerlies, is pushing A23a in the general direction of the South Orkney Islands, which are about 600km (370 miles) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

The berg has entered what scientists refer to as ""iceberg alley"", a track that passes South Georgia

It is firmly in the track of what scientists refer to as ""iceberg alley"" - the major route for the export of ice from the continent.

The interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine its precise course over the coming weeks, but many of these giant flat-topped, or tabular, bergs end up passing by the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.

Their destiny is to fragment and wither to nothing. Their legacy is the ocean life they seed by dropping entrained mineral nutrients. From plankton up to great whales - all benefit from the melting bergs' fertilisation effect.

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Richard Sidey

A submerged terrace develops as the walls crumble. Buoyancy will force this terrace upwards

On Sunday, the Eyos team got close enough to A23a to put up a drone. The berg's 30m-high cliffs were topped by a dense mist. Icebergs on this scale create their own weather.

""It was dramatic and beautiful to photograph,"" said Eyos videographer Richard Sidey.

""It's mind-bogglingly big. I actually don't think we can fathom just how big it is; we can only know how big it is from science. It's certainly too big to photograph. It stretches as far as you can see in both directions.""

Satellite observations can monitor its area coverage and gauge its thickness, which is over 300m (980ft) in places. In terms of mass, it's not far off a trillion tonnes, although this will be decreasing day by day.

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Ian Strachan

A dense mist hangs over A23a: It's so big it makes its own weather

The big question is: how long can A23a survive as it moves away from the colder climes of the Antarctic?

Milder air temperatures will create surface melt ponds that drain through the berg, helping to open up fractures. And those spectacular surface catacombs and arches will collapse to leave extensive areas of submerged ice that will then rise up under their own buoyancy to gnaw away at the berg's edges.

But another large block of ice ahead of A23a on the highway may be instructive in understanding its potential longevity.

BBC

Shukur Shermatov teaches repatriated women of suspected IS recruits

""Welcome back to Kyrgyzstan,"" says Shukur Shermatov, addressing a class of 20 women. He is wearing a traditional felt cap, but there is nothing traditional about this school. It sits inside two rings of military security and the students are women who have been brought home from camps in Syria, where they ended up after living with the Islamic State group.

The rehabilitation centre is woven into the mountains of northern Kyrgyzstan, and it is where wives and children of suspected IS recruits spend their first six weeks after being repatriated.

Our BBC World Service team are among the first visitors, and like the residents, everything we say and do is closely monitored by the state intelligence agency.

The women listen to Shukur attentively as he takes them through their first lesson. The course covers citizenship, religious ethics, and anger management. Posters on the wall offer tips on how to control your emotions.

As well as the re-education programme, the families receive medical treatment, psychological support, and - for the first time in years for many - sufficient food, water, and shelter.

Some countries have balked at repatriating women such as these - women who say they followed husbands, fathers and brothers into a war zone unknowingly. What happened to them there - what they did, how much they knew - has been hidden in the wreckage of the so-called caliphate. Decisions on whether they are victim or perpetrator now have to be made by officials, potentially thousands of miles away.

The Kyrgyz government has, at least for now, decided to treat them as the former - albeit, cautiously. Nine out of 10 are under police investigation.

After the lesson, we are led into a simple dormitory with four single beds, where we meet a woman draped in a purple hijab. We are calling her Fatima, not her real name, for her safety. Through a small window, the snowy lakeside landscape could not look more different to the Syrian camp she has left behind.

""The main thing here is that it's calm. Everyone is so grateful for that. The children love it."" She pauses and appreciates the silence. ""The calm.""

Fatima followed her husband to Turkey in 2013 when he said he wanted to work there. The whole family went, including Fatima's two adult sons, her daughter and a grandchild. She says she only realised they were in Syria when she heard the roar of jet planes overhead and saw IS guards.

We asked whether she really had no idea where they were going and, like many of the women we met, she insisted she was unaware and it was normal for a woman to follow her husband.

Within days of their arrival in Syria, she had lost her husband and son. Her husband burned to death after a bomb hit his car, while her son was shot by a sniper. Shortly afterwards, her other son fell ill and died.

Fatima is one of 110 women brought back from Syria in 2023 as part of Kyrgyzstan's rehabilitation programme

Unable to leave, the women spent nearly six years under brutal IS rule in Iraq and Syria, where Fatima's daughter had more children. When IS fighters were driven out, Fatima, her daughter and four grandchildren ended up in al-Hol, Syria's largest detention camp for suspected IS fighters and their families. They spent four years there, desperate to come home.

""Women were sick and children were crying all the time. We were begging them to let us leave,"" she says. ""We barely survived. When people from Kyrgyzstan came to collect the first group, everyone was in shock.""

In October, her daughter and grandchildren were told they were being repatriated, but not Fatima.

""I cried when they told me I wasn't on the list. How wasn't I on the list? I'm their mother!"" she sobs. ""But now that I am here and will soon be back with my family, I am so happy. I'm glad my grandchildren can have an education. I want them to study science, to understand the world better.""

At 57, Fatima is the oldest person in the rehabilitation centre, one of 110 mothers and 229 children Kyrgyzstan brought back from Syria in 2023 as part of a new repatriation operation. Only Iraq repatriated more last year.

Kyrgyzstan plans to bring back at least another 260 women and children, after years of campaigning by relatives of people stuck in Syria. The aim is to give people the government believes may have been victims a second chance.

Even so, the returnees are all interrogated and remain under regular surveillance after finishing the reintegration course. Nine in 10 are facing criminal investigations, the head of the Kyrgyz national security council told us. Potential charges could include assisting terrorism or transporting children to a war zone. As yet, however, no-one has been prosecuted.

The continued surveillance, and potential of criminal proceedings, mean the women are often reluctant to talk about their time in Syria.

After Elmira, who has passed through the rehabilitation centre and is now rebuilding her life in a town outside the capital, Bishkek, agrees to speak to us, we get a glimpse of what this monitoring looks like.

Soon after we arranged to see her, we were phoned by her social worker, notifying us that she would be present at the interview too. When we arrived, two counter-terror police officers, whom the family recognised, were there as well. After some discussion, they agreed to wait outside.

The snowy landscape of Kyrgyzstan is very different to the Syrian camps where many of the women were living

Elmira claims she was tricked into going to Syria by a man she met online. He convinced her to join him in Turkey and, thinking they would be happy together, four days after her 18th birthday she flew out to meet him.

But when she got there, she was greeted by a different man who said he was his friend and took her on a 17-hour drive across the Syrian border. She claims that by the time she realised what was happening, it was too late to turn back.

She married twice. Her first husband died after a couple of months, then she married a man from Dagestan and had his child. She won't say any more about what he was doing in Syria but explains they were looking for a way out before he died in a rocket attack.

Elmira says the hardest moment was when she thought her daughter might be dead. She had gone out, leaving her little girl at home, when rockets hit their neighbourhood. Terrified for her child, Elmira ran home in tears.

""Then someone brought her out, alive, healthy, and she was just afraid. The neighbour's house had been hit and other children who were nearby died.""

Like Fatima, Elmira and her daughter ended up in al-Hol camp.

""I still can't believe it. Sometimes I wake up at night and don't know if I'm dreaming,"" she tells us. ""I'm so grateful to everyone who helped get us out of there and didn't abandon us. We know that not every country does that.""

Elmira, who is now training as a seamstress, asked us not to disclose her real name. After seeing the response to the repatriations from some Kyrgyz people on social media, she has decided not to tell anyone about her past.

""It isn't pleasant,"" she says. ""A lot of us don't understand why they are afraid of us. We are afraid of them! People think we have come back here with machine guns and suicide belts. It's not like that. We are people just like they are. We also have families. We also have children. And we also want to lead peaceful and happy lives.""

""And why tell people, when I myself want to forget?"" Elmira adds. ""I was 18 then. I'm 27 now. I've learned not to be so naïve.""

Many displaced families of Islamic State (IS) foreign fighters are held at al-Hol camp in Syria

Elmira's mother, Hamida Yusupova, spent the past decade pleading with the Kyrgyz authorities to bring back her daughter and granddaughter, and founded a campaign group for parents of girls who went to Syria.

""We know that Syria can be a one-way trip. You start to realise that your child might never make it back home,"" she says.

""I thank God, that she's back home and, finally, I've met my granddaughter. But Elmira has lost nine years of her youth. It's a long time.""

When Hamida came to collect them from the rehabilitation centre, their reunion was filled with more tears than words.

""Elmira had become a mother. She understood how hard it is when you raise a child for 18 years and, one day, they tell you they're 'going to work', shut the door, and disappear to Syria. I wouldn't wish it on any mother,"" Hamida says.

""All Elmira could say was: 'Mum, forgive me, forgive me.' Nothing else. Apart from, then she told me how much I had aged!""

Elmira and Hamida are well aware that not everyone around them will be forgiving.

Like many of its central Asian neighbours, Kyrgyzstan - where 90% of the population identify as Muslim - was a major source of recruits for IS, a UN-designated terrorist group, during its rise to prominence.

Hamida feels her daughter was a victim of manipulative men and guilty only of being gullible. However, we spoke to Kyrgyz women the same age as Elmira who said they felt anxious that the returnees could radicalise others, especially after seeing how the Taliban retook Afghanistan.

""As a mum, I've heard a lot of insults and slurs. I don't want my child to have to hear that. I don't want people to point fingers at my child and call her a terrorist,"" Hamida says.

Hamida Yusupova founded a campaign group for parents of girls who went to Syria

Deputy Prime Minister Edil Baisalov is keen to showcase the repatriation policy as proof that Kyrgyzstan is a tolerant democracy that looks after all of its citizens.

""I believe that the best thing is that they forget the nightmare they have been through, and that nobody in their families and communities remembers this situation. That everyone is just a good citizen of Kyrgyzstan,"" he tells us.

Mr Baisalov knows this is a contentious subject, particularly in some Western countries. A former ambassador to the UK, he was in post shortly after Shamima Begum, one of three London schoolgirls who left to join IS, had her British citizenship revoked.

The deputy prime minister also wanted to send a political message. Human rights groups have questioned Kyrgyzstan's reputation as an island of democracy in central Asia since disputed elections in 2020 and the introduction of new laws.

""For Kyrgyzstan, this was not an easy decision,"" he said. ""Of course, our kind of Islam is not radical. It is a very tolerant Islam, respectful of other religions. We are a small nation that needs to take care of each other. Even of those who commit mistakes.""

The scheme is supported by the UN children's agency Unicef and Sylvi Hill, who lead their repatriation efforts in Kyrgyzstan, describes it as ""commendable"". She says Unicef is calling for ""all governments to facilitate the return, rehabilitation and reintegration of their children affected by conflict"".","Women and children who went to live with IS in Syria are being brought homeBy Eleanora Kulenbekova and Daniel Wittenberg BBC World Service, KyrgyzstanBBCShukur Shermatov teaches repatriated women of suspected IS recruits""Welcome back to Kyrgyzstan,"" says Shukur Shermatov, addressing a class of 20 women.

Later in his professional career, Mandje raced at the World Cross Country Championships and the World Trail Racing Championships.

But the track was his first love, and specifically the 1500m.

Which is handy, because his team's policy, and that of most of the other 14 teams, was little and often.

In essence, the favoured tactic for the fastest way to clock 500km was frequently swapping runners in and out and breaking the distance down into two or three kilometre sections each.

On repeat.

For nearly two days.

In theory, each leg sounded pretty achievable. About half a Parkrun at a time.

But, as Mandje attests, in the middle of the night, without any sleep and with a day's running already in your legs, The Speed Project got serious.

Mandje made his living racing the 1500m at top speed, recovering with ice baths and complex warm-down routines.

In Chile, with recovery taking place while cooped up eating cold pizza in the back of a pick-up truck, he found himself suddenly reduced to walking parts of the TSP route.

""What made it really, really challenging is you're running short intervals and then getting into a van, getting stiff, getting tired, then in another hour you're jumping back out to run again,"" says Mandje.

""After two days that starts to wear and tear on you - especially for those overnight legs when you're out there with your thoughts and accumulated fatigue.

""The hardest point, somewhere on day two, I just hit a 30km stretch where I struggled. Each time I got out of the vehicle I had to start each leg as like a shuffle or a speed walk.

""It was also the point of the journey where you're a long way from the start, so you can sniff the finish but you also know there's a long way, and a lot of climbing, to go.

""But hitting a rough patch was part of the beauty of it.""

Long before Mandje's personal crisis, the race itself was thrown into a wider crisis.

Much more serious than pain in the legs, this was related to the strong arm of the law.","Later in his professional career, Mandje raced at the World Cross Country Championships and the World Trail Racing Championships.

By Adrian Goldberg & Paul Grant File on 4

BBC

A top-venting blank firing gun

Converted handguns - originally designed to fire blanks - are currently responsible for more shooting incidents in the UK than ""real"" handguns.

Police figures reveal there were 64 discharges from converted models in 2023, compared with 42 from real equivalent weapons.

Converted handguns were responsible for four deaths and 17 serious injuries.

A government ballistics expert says the issue is ""a top-line threat priority"".

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) - which provided the provisional figures in response to a Freedom of Information request from BBC's File On 4 - says there were also seven incidents in 2023 in which a converted sub-machine gun was fired.

Blank firing guns are produced for a number of reasons - such as for use in theatre or film, as starting pistols, or at firearms' demonstration events.

Instead of firing bullets, they use cartridges filled with gunpowder, which make a gun-like noise and a spark.

""The issue is that they look like the real thing,"" says Gregg Taylor, who is forensic technical lead at the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Nabis), which analyses firearms discharges for all 45 UK police forces.

""Sometimes they even include genuine parts from genuine weapons,"" he adds. ""Therefore you've got 90% of what you already need to then go on - and do the extra 10% to convert.""

Blank firing guns are categorised by the way they discharge or ""vent"" gunpowder fumes - at the front of the weapon, or, at the top or side.

""Forward-venting"" guns closely resemble authentic firearms, and have been banned in the UK for several years because they are regarded as too easy to convert. They are widely available in some EU countries, and sometimes smuggled into the UK.

""Top-venting"" or ""side-venting"" blank guns are legal to buy in the UK for anyone over the age of 18, as they have solid barrels and are considered more difficult to convert.

However, in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of weapons converted from top- or side-venting blank guns.

""There is a downward trend with original weapons and an upward trend of converted weapons,"" says Taylor. ""And for the first time in a while now, we've seen converted weapons overtake the use of original weapons.""

Ballistics expert Gregg Taylor says the issue of converted weapons is a ""top-line threat priority""

File on 4 bought a top-venting blank firearm - which is based on a real handgun - for £99.99 from an online retailer, which only requested proof of age.

Reformed criminal Sicarius McGrath, who once ran an illegal gun factory in Liverpool, assessed the weapon for the programme, and said that he was surprised - and concerned - at how easy it would be to adapt.

""There's no doubt in my mind that I could convert that within half an hour,"" he said.

McGrath explained that once he got to know the weapon, he would be able to reduce the conversion time to just 15 or 20 minutes, using readily available tools.

Guns that fire blanks are being converted into deadly weapons by criminals. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service says their use currently exceeds the use of real guns.

Forty-five blank firing guns identical to the ones we bought were seized by West Midlands Police in 2021, from an organised crime gang which was converting them into live guns.

Simon West, executive director of the Gun Trade Association, maintains that there are legitimate uses for blank firing guns, such as bird scaring.

He says this is because the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs does not allow farmers to shoot birds unless they have tried other methods of scaring them away from crops.

""That has meant quite a lot of people have had to get hold of blank firers,"" he says.

Blank-firing guns are used in theatre and film - and as starting pistols

However, Prof Peter Squires, a criminologist who works with the National Crime Agency, says he is ""profoundly sceptical"" of the claim. ""The idea that someone has to go out and pull a trigger repeatedly to scare birds is quite farcical,"" he says.

Prof Squires believes that a stop should be put to the the production, manufacture and distribution of guns that ""have no legitimate purpose and are potentially convertible into lethal weapons"".

The Home Office says it is working to ""mitigate the threat of criminally convertible blank-firing firearms entering the UK"".","Converted handguns fired more than 'real' weapons in UK crimesBy Adrian Goldberg & Paul Grant File on 4BBCA top-venting blank firing gunConverted handguns - originally designed to fire blanks - are currently responsible for more shooting incidents in the UK than ""real"" handguns.

By Soutik Biswas India correspondent

Ayodhya Ram Temple: A glittering makeover for a holy Indian city

On a brutally cold morning, Yogendra Guru looked adrift in a maze of traffic after visiting the heavily secured makeshift shrine where Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.

Frenzied construction work provided the backdrop in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya - a vast centre to welcome pilgrims, arched sandstone gates, a broad corridor leading to a grand new $217m (£170m) temple for the Hindu deity. A multi-billion dollar makeover has seen swathes of the city bulldozed to turn it into what some Hindu nationalist leaders are calling a ""Hindu Vatican"".

Mr Guru had endured a gruelling 14-hour bus journey with two dozen family members who made the pilgrimage to Ayodhya from their village in Morena district in central Madhya Pradesh state.

""I am elated that we are finally getting a new temple. It seems like the Hindus have awakened, experiencing a sense of freedom. I believe we were previously suppressed,"" he told me.

Next week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fulfil a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge by opening the temple, which replaces a 16th-Century mosque that once stood here, on one of India's most controversial religious sites. In 1992, Hindu mobs tore down the Babri mosque, claiming it was built by Muslim invaders on the ruins of a Ram temple, sparking nationwide riots that took nearly 2,000 lives.

Stretching across 7.2 acres, the three-storey shrine, clad in sandstone and anchored by granite, boasts of towering pillars

The stormy ownership dispute between Hindus and Muslims ended in 2019 when the Supreme Court granted the site to Hindus, despite explicitly stating that the demolition of the mosque was an ""egregious violation of the rule of law"". (The court gave Muslims another plot of land in Ayodhya to construct a mosque.)

Mr Modi opens the Ayodhya temple months before general elections, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) eyeing a record third consecutive term. He says the new temple will ""unify the nation"". Senior minister Rajnath Singh believes the shrine would mark ""the beginning of India's cultural revival and restore national pride"".

Critics say the timing of the opening leans more towards political strategy than religious significance, building a Hindu nationalist momentum ahead of the polls. After all, they argue, the movement to build a temple was a major factor in propelling the BJP to a prominent position in Indian politics.

""After enduring life in a tent, Lord Ram has now found a rightful abode. It's been a test of patience for all of us,"" said Satyendra Das, the 86-year-old head priest of the makeshift shrine, where a smaller idol of Ram had been placed for the past three decades.

The new temple is as grand as it gets. Stretching across 7.2 acres in a 70-acre complex, the imposing three-storey structure, clad in pink sandstone and anchored by black granite, boasts towering pillars and rests upon 70,000 sq ft (6,503 sq m) of pristine white marble. A 51-inch (4.25-ft) idol of Ram will be placed on a marble pedestal.

When fully complete - Mr Modi will be opening only the ground floor on 22 January - by the end of the year, the temple will expect to greet a staggering 150,000 visitors per day, seven times the current rate.

Ayodhya's makeover includes a shiny new airport...

Getty Images

...and a massive new railway station

To make all this happen, Mr Modi's government is pulling out all the stops to transform Ayodhya, a tranquil pilgrim town on the banks of Saryu, a tributary of the Ganges, to what officials call a ""world class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"".

The $3.85bn (£3.01bn) makeover includes expanded roads, a shiny new airport, a massive railway station, and a multi-level car park. More than 3,000 homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to facilitate the widening of four main roads, including the newly christened 13km (8-mile) Ram Path, leading to the temple. A lighter yellow paint now gives the buildings a uniform, bland look.

Hotel chains like Radisson and Taj are building new properties; up to 50 new hotels and homestays are planned, while scores of grubby guesthouses are receiving facelifts. Not surprisingly, land prices have already trebled.

""You can't recognise the place, it's changed so much now. There's actually a bit of shock and awe that all this has happened,"" said Valay Singh, author of Ayodhya: City of Faith, City of Discord, who has been visiting the the city since 2016.

There are also plans for additional attractions surrounding the new temple, including a heritage walk featuring 162 murals depicting Ram's life, a facility on a Saryu river island offering ""insights into the Vedic civilisation"", and the creation of a wedding city and developing the place as a naturopathy centre.

""We want to create the most beautiful city in the world,"" says Gaurav Dayal, Ayodhya's most senior official.

BIMAL THANKACHAN

More than 3,000 homes and shops have been either completely or partially demolished to widen pilgrim corridors

Bimal Thankachan

Half of Vishal Pandey's ancestral six-room house had been demolished for the road widening of a pilgrim corridor

Faith threads its way through every facet of life in Ayodhya, where temples rise like sentinels in an untidy skyline and monks walk the streets. Tens of thousands of pilgrims circumambulate the city at least twice a year. The ubiquitous monkeys still have a free run. Bazaars teem with hawkers selling religious bric-a-brac: flowers, sandalwood, devotional books, replicas of deities.

Mr Singh describes it as a ""fragile, pilgrim-dependent economy"". On her first visit to the city, Disha Chakraborty, a student of life sciences from Shillong in north-eastern India, told me: ""This place is dilapidated, let's be honest. But it doesn't matter because people are so devoted. So many have put their collective faith in an idol.""

Yet, in this city of both a few thousand temples, large and small, and 45-odd mosques, and festivals and fairs, a transformation is under way, blending the old with the new.

As well as tattoo parlours and takeout food, Ayodhya has a restaurant called Dark Cloud and a salon called Stylish Chand Men's Parlour, offering a variety of style cuts. Laser shows light up the sky after the dark. The place swarms with competing YouTubers and Instagram Reel makers, each trying to make the place ""trend"".

Shakila Bano makes a garland of marigold flowers at her house - Ayodhya's temple economy is dependent on local Muslims

Inspired by faith, tradition and curiosity, millions of devotees and tourists are now expected to descend on Ayodhya after the new temple opens. Yet, even in its peace, there are rumblings of discontent. The road-widening initiative for pilgrims slices through the city, leaving a trail of homes and shops smashed by bulldozers.

Anand Kumar Gupta, who heads an association of local shopkeepers, said around 1,600 of them have ""been displaced and have nowhere to go"". He added that they were paid an average of 100,000 ($1,200) rupees for repairs. ""This rebuilding has disturbed us,"" he said.

On a pilgrim route being widened, some three dozen homes of people who work in the city's temples stand partially demolished. The street is overflowing with sewage from leaky pipes. Wobbly bamboo bridges stretch precariously over muddy trenches that scar the ground outside the doors. Owners of the completely destroyed homes have been given plots at a distance.

Vishal Pandey said that half of his ancestral six-room house had been demolished for the road widening. Despite a compensation close to 700,000 rupees for the affected portion, the toll on their eight-member generational dwelling is irreversible, he added. ""There is anger among the locals,"" Mr Pandey told me. ""But we are also happy that Ram is finally getting a permanent home. He was in a tent for such a long time. Now it's our turn [to suffer].

""Where there is destruction, there is development. Let's see what happens.""

Kanti Devi, who has lost half of her house, is more trenchant. ""We are not happy at all,"" she says. ""Even the officials come and tell us we are giving you a lot of pain. It's good that the temple has been made, but how does it help us? Whatever we built, they have razed to get more pilgrims into the town.""

Officials say residents of the demolished dwellings and shops have been compensated with money and new houses under government schemes. ""All compensation has been given. It is delayed in some cases because of litigation involving family disputes. There's nothing left to be done now,"" says Mr Dayal.

In many ways, people coming in from outside have shaped the destiny of Ayodhya where Hindus and Muslims have for long lived in mixed neighbourhoods. This endured despite the demolition and a subsequent attack on local Muslims in December 1992, allegedly leading to the death of 18 Muslims and the torching of their homes. It was a city that became the flashpoint for religious violence.

""We have moved on. However, the events remain a source of pain for us,"" said Khaliq Ahmed Khan, a social worker.

Mr Khan believes Hindus and Muslims shared warm relations in Ayodhya, rooted in a centuries-old inter-dependence. ""Hindu devotion to Ram is intertwined with the support of Muslims, particularly in the temple economy, where their trade plays a crucial role. The two communities are inseparable.""

This sentiment is echoed by Raghuvansh Mani, a local college professor: ""The sectarian strife originated from outside; the local people have minimal involvement in that."" Some locals share similar sentiments, feeling that outsiders are determining their fate, as the new temple aims to open Ayodhya to the world.

""Only time will tell,"" says Mr Pandey.","A multi-billion dollar makeover has seen swathes of the city bulldozed to turn it into what some Hindu nationalist leaders are calling a ""Hindu Vatican"".

By Daniela Relph Royal correspondent, in Copenhagen

A crowd of 100,000 lined the streets of Copenhagen to celebrate the new king

In the UK, there hadn't been a new monarch for 70 years. In Denmark, it had been 52 years. But I've now been to two 'coronations' in the space of eight months.

I was at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III last May, and at Christansborg Palace, in Copenhagen, for the proclamation of King Frederik X, on Sunday.

In the UK, the centre of the Coronation was a deeply religious ceremony, steeped in ancient tradition, with the anointing of the monarch with holy oil and a crown being placed upon his head.

In Denmark, it was inside a government meeting, the signing of an abdication declaration and a prime minister proclaiming a new king from a palace balcony.

The choreography was different. The ritual was less complicated and extravagant in Denmark. But what was surprising was the two events felt strangely similar.

I joined more than 100,000 people on the streets of Copenhagen over the weekend to witness the first change of sovereign here since 1972. Everyone had told me it would be quite low key.

""Nothing like what you Brits do for a new monarch,"" one person said.

I was ready for an event that reeked of Scandinavian coolness, a casual transfer of royal power as Danes gave it a passing glance on a chilly Sunday afternoon. It was nothing like that at all.

Getty Images

What our correspondent had expected to be a low-key event turned out to be anything but

The abdication of a queen and the proclamation of a new king brought the entire city centre to a standstill for several hours. Media coverage was wall to wall.

The BBC had a camera position in front of the Christiansborg Palace balcony. German TV was on air to my left, Norway's was broadcasting to my right.

The Norwegian presenter arrived with a huge bag from where she assembled her own table and chairs and literally built her own set. She dressed it with a coloured tablecloth that matched the branding of her TV station adorned with the Danish and Norwegian flags.

On reflection, the early signs of a population engaged with this proclamation were obvious.

Crowds poured out of the metro, many of them wearing home-made crowns. I spotted someone who'd come in fancy dress as Queen Margrethe - the ultimate tribute to the outgoing monarch.

Patisseries swapped Margrethe cakes for their new Frederik range, and shop windows showed the official portraits of the incoming king and queen.

Low key? Not a chance.

An interviewee had told me that the Coronation in the UK last May was very ""fussy"" and had been ""drowning in nostalgia"". The Danish way would be very different, I was promised.

On some levels, the two monarchies are definitely different; British royalty is grander, more formal and still a bit distant. It has retained a sense of untouchability.

The UK royal family is bigger and more expensive than the smaller, more compact Danish version, where the royal children go to state schools and the new king and queen have been able to go to the cinema and eat out in Copenhagen without being bothered.

But the two events had much in common.

King Frederik and Queen Mary waved to the crowds from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace

Like Elizabeth II, Margrethe II was the only queen a whole generation of Danes had ever known.

Both women were hugely popular public figures. And there was a desire by tens of thousands of people to be part of an event that the majority had not witnessed before.

""It's cold but it I'm very glad to be here,"" one person in the crowd told me. ""It's very special."" They said they would not describe themselves as a royalist.

Another person, wrapped up against the freezing temperatures but still managing to balance a paper crown on their woolly hat, spoke of ""sharing in something unique"".

In a world where so much is available and easy to reach, a UK coronation and a Danish proclamation were genuinely new experiences for vast swathes of both populations.

The shock Danes felt when the queen abdicated on New Year's Eve really set the mood for the weekend.

Getty Images

A stroke of the pen was all that was needed to transfer the throne from Queen Margrethe to her son, Crown Prince Frederik

Like the UK, a royal changeover in Denmark usually means a monarch has died. Queen Margrethe wore black for her own Proclamation, in 1972, still grieving the death of her father.

But her decision to abdicate allowed a different tone to be set. There has been no period of mourning, no funeral to plan, no grieving family.

The Coronation in the UK last May was designed as a celebration of a new king and queen.

I interviewed dozens of guests as they arrived at Westminster Abbey: friends, charity workers, representatives of their communities - and amid the chat about the new monarch, there was a still a reflective mood.

It was several months since the death of Queen Elizabeth II, but she was on people's minds that day.

The Danish succession to the throne happened without a backdrop of sadness.

The final carriage ride through Copenhagen allowed Queen Margrethe to say her goodbyes.

The balcony moment, with a tearful new King and his family, gave Danish people a chance to formally welcome a new sovereign after 52 years and to celebrate him publicly.

What ties both King Charles III and King Frederik X together is how they now manage the legacy they inherit from their mothers - women who navigated the privilege and pitfalls of royal life while retaining high levels of public support.","I was at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III last May, and at Christansborg Palace, in Copenhagen, for the proclamation of King Frederik X, on Sunday.

Nabeeha also loved to write poetry and read books by the American author Jodi Picoult - and she was days away from graduating with a science degree from Ahmadu Bello University.

""On the day the kidnapping happened, I asked Nabeeha if we were going to the [graduation ceremony] together, and she said yes,"" recalls Ms Adamu. It was the last time she saw her alive.

That evening, on 2 January, Nabeeha was abducted along with her father and sisters from their home in the outskirts of the capital, Abuja.

Nigerian police have not confirmed what happened next. Witnesses say Nabeeha's uncle ran to find help but was ambushed and killed, as were three police officers. It is not known why the family was targeted.

The kidnappers demanded to be paid a huge sum of cash by 12 January, and when they did not get it they killed Nabeeha as a warning, according to a member of the family who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.

Nabeeha's kidnappers handed over her body and, in accordance with Islamic rites, she was swiftly buried by her family on Saturday.

A national reckoning

News of Nabeeha's plight began to circulate over the weekend, prompting widespread grief and indignation that Nigeria's kidnapping crisis rages on despite government promises to bring it to an end.

This moment of reckoning has moved the president's wife to speak out and confirm Nabeeha's death, even though police had not yet officially done so.

Security agencies must ""intensify their efforts"" to end Nigeria's kidnapping and security crisis, said First Lady Remi Tinubu on Monday, demanding a ""swift return of the Al-Kadriyar sisters"".

Their father Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, who was freed days ago in order to fetch the ransom money, now faces an agonising wait for their return. His daughters' captors are demanding a higher sum of 65m naira ($68,000; £53,000), to be paid by Wednesday.

Hundreds of Nigerians have been kidnapped for ransom in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. Close to 20 people were abducted in in the first week of 2024 alone.

No matter how desperate the circumstances, Nigerian law prohibits the payment of ransom money. However, many victims pay up because they do not trust authorities or their track record.

Even a former minister appears to share this scepticism of the Nigerian state's ability to bring the abducted back.

""I am personally not in support of paying ransom to criminals. However... I spoke with a friend who offered to pay the remaining 50 million naira,"" says ex-Digital Economy Minister Isa Ali Pantami, who is now a professor in cybersecurity, and a Muslim cleric.

He was one of the architects of the policy of registering all mobile phone Sim cards, in order to make life harder for kidnappers and extortionists, but says he is ""frustrated"" that it has not been better implemented despite allegedly enduring ""threats to my life"".

Nabeeha's cousin, Asiya Adamu, has also crowdfunded money from well-wishers online to help pay the ransom. She did not respond to the BBC's request to disclose the total raised, saying security officers had advised her not to so.

While she prays for the safe return of the rest of her cousins, Ms Adamu is haunted by the thought that she narrowly avoided the same fate. She tells the BBC she was due to spend time at their house that day but later changed her mind.

""My favourite memories of Nabeeha was mostly when we were in the kitchen together,"" Ms Adamu recalls.

""Losing her has left a void one cannot explain with words. She was a source of comfort and understanding and I've lost that,"" she adds.

""She had plans of going to Morocco for her Masters because she liked the place.

""I guess we make plans and Allah has the last word.""

By Catriona MacPhee & Rachel Coburn BBC Disclosure

Undercover footage shows a surgeon telling a reporter she could qualify for gastric sleeve surgery if she ate more

A Turkish doctor selling weight-loss ""holidays"" abroad told an undercover BBC reporter to gain weight so she could have gastric sleeve surgery.

Dr Ogün Erşen told the reporter to ""eat some snacks"" so she could increase her body mass index (BMI) to qualify for his weight loss surgery.

The BBC reporter had a BMI of 24.4, which is within the healthy weight range.

""You must eat, eat. Eat something and reach 30,"" Dr Ersen said.

The reporter gave the weight-loss clinic information which would have meant her BMI was 29 but she was not weighed and no medical checks were carried out during her consultation.

Instead, Dr Erşen offered to book her in for surgery in three months' time and told her to try to put on weight.

A health expert told the BBC it was completely unethical to push a patient to gain weight to hit the threshold for surgery.

He stressed the risks of this irreversible surgery and said it should not be done if it is not needed.

Bariatric surgery, also known as weight-loss surgery, is used to treat people who are dangerously obese

Referrals to weight management services in Scotland are up 96% compared to pre-pandemic levels and waiting lists for bariatric surgery on the NHS can exceed four years in some areas.

The price to have it done privately in the UK is between £10,000 and £15,000 but it can cost as little as £2,000 to book weight-loss surgery in Turkey.

However, a BBC Disclosure investigation has uncovered the unethical practices used by some companies offering cheap weight-loss ""holidays"" abroad.

Ekol Hospitals is one of the many Turkish companies targeting British customers. It regularly holds sales days in cities across the UK.

Undercover filming at a sales day in Glasgow revealed Ekol accepting patients whose BMI did not meet the criteria for bariatric surgery.

BMI is based on a person's height and weight and it is one of the main factors when assessing for bariatric surgery.

A patient with a BMI of less than 40, and no severe co-morbidities relating to obesity, would typically be rejected for weight-loss surgery in the UK.

Under the international IFSO guidelines the threshold is lower, at 35.

What is bariatric surgery?

Bariatric surgery, also known as weight-loss surgery, is used by the NHS as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese (having a body mass index of 40 or above or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions).

Patients must have tried and failed to achieve clinically-beneficial weight loss by all other appropriate non-surgical methods and be fit for surgery.

The two most common types of weight loss surgery are:

Sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass , where some of the stomach is removed or the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach

, where some of the stomach is removed or the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach Gastric band, where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach so a smaller amount of food is required to make someone feel full

At the Ekol sales day, two undercover journalists falsely presented medical information which should have ruled them out

They said their BMIs were 29 and 33 - and one cited depression, all of which should have raised red flags with the consultant.

An Ekol sales rep also encouraged the reporter to eat more and return for surgery at a later date.

The sales rep said: ""I yo-yo dieted my whole life, for 30 years, and I got my sleeve two years ago.""

She added: ""Do you look into more traditional ways, and risk that yo-yo? Or do you just let it go for a few months and eat like a pig? High fat, high calorie, high everything.""

In a statement, Ekol Hospitals said: ""We completely refute the suggestion that our hospital accepts patients for surgeries who do not meet international guidelines or criteria.

""Whilst at the hospital, a full and extensive health check is completed.""

When later asked for a response, the sales rep said: ""It is unfortunate that our health care, NHS or private, is unable to cope with the obesity epidemic in our country, ideally every person would have access to the health care they need but that is not the case.""

Dr Erşen denied he made the comments encouraging a patient to gain weight.

Omar Khan, a consultant bariatric surgeon, said he had concerns over the consultation

Omar Khan, a consultant bariatric surgeon and chairman of the National Bariatric Surgery Registry, described the consultation as ""utterly indefensible"".

He said: ""I have major concerns. It seems that he's almost pushing the patient to hit the target so that they can do the surgery and that's completely unethical.

""There's no surgery which is risk free. What we have to do is balance those risks against potential benefits of weight loss surgery.

""If you take someone who is thin, there's no point in giving them weight loss surgery, because they'll take all of the risks of surgery, but none of the benefits.""

Gill Baird, who runs a cosmetic surgery business in Glasgow, says she regularly turns people away for weight-loss surgery because they do not meet the criteria.

Gill Baird says she regularly turns people away for weight-loss surgery

She said: ""We check for stones in your pockets when you come to the scales.

""We've had patients come in with anoraks on and you'll find that they've got weights in their pockets trying to make themselves heavier. It happens quite a lot.

""They do it because they're desperate, and I can understand that. But they're not understanding the risks that they're taking with their health.""

For some British patients the consequences of going abroad have been fatal.

""Unfortunately, we recently had a situation with a patient from the UK who had inquired with us about a particular procedure,"" Ms Baird said.

""She didn't meet the criteria. We had advised her of that and she told me on the phone that she was going to see a provider who was based abroad the very next day.

""Unfortunately a few weeks later it was in the headlines that she'd sadly passed away as a result of that surgery abroad, which was difficult to process.""","Weight-loss surgeon told patient to 'eat, eat, eat'By Catriona MacPhee & Rachel Coburn BBC DisclosureUndercover footage shows a surgeon telling a reporter she could qualify for gastric sleeve surgery if she ate moreA Turkish doctor selling weight-loss ""holidays"" abroad told an undercover BBC reporter to gain weight so she could have gastric sleeve surgery.

Zayn Malik's collaboration with popular Pakistani band Aur has given fans much to celebrate - with many psyched that the British singer is fluent in Urdu.

A remake of Aur's breakout hit Tu Hai Kahan features the ex-One Direction singer providing vocals in Urdu.

The original version of the song has more than 95m views though the remake, released last Friday, is fast catching up, with 3m views.

Malik said he was ""incredibly humbled"" when Aur reached out to him.

""I love the song and have brought some of myself to it. I hope people love what we've done,"" he said.

The 31-year-old was born in Bradford, England, but his father is a Pakistani immigrant to the UK.

The song was quick to gain fans online - with some social media users urging Malik to release ""more Urdu songs please"".

""Some languages just make you feel things... I hope [Zayn] does more fully Urdu songs,"" said one user on X.

Many Urdu speaking fans also celebrated the track, with one calling it a ""gift for his fellow Pakistanis"".

""Desi girls, wake up, Zayn Malik's one Urdu verse literally changed our lives,"" another X user chimed in.

Malik's music career began in 2010 as part of One Direction, a boy band formed on British TV music competition, The X Factor. He released his debut album, Mind of Mine, in 2016. A song in his 2021 album, Nobody is Listening, also included Urdu lyrics.

A man has appeared in court charged in relation to plans to disrupt the London Stock Exchange.

Sean Middleborough, 31, of Woodlee Road, Liverpool, appeared at Wirral Magistrates' Court charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.

The defendant, wearing a grey tracksuit, spoke to confirm his name, age and address.

Five others were arrested in London, Liverpool and Brighton on Sunday.

Mr Middleborough was remanded in custody until 12 February, when he will appear at Suffolk Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing.

Activists from the group Palestine Action were allegedly plotting to target the London Stock Exchange on Monday, the Met said.

The force said activists had been planning to stop the exchange from opening for trading by ""locking on"" to the building, and causing damage.

The Met said there was a ""suggestion that this was one part of a planned week of action"".

The arrests were prompted by information shared by the Daily Express.

Speaking on Sunday, Det Supt Sian Thomas described the arrests as ""significant"".

By Annabelle Liang Business reporter

Artificial intelligence is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs, according to a new analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva says ""in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality"".

Ms Georgieva adds that policymakers should address the ""troubling trend"" to ""prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions"".

The proliferation of AI has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight.

The IMF said AI is likely to affect a greater proportion of jobs - put at around 60% - in advanced economies. In half of these instances, workers can expect to benefit from the integration of AI, which will enhance their productivity.

In other instances, AI will have the ability to perform key tasks that are currently executed by humans. This could lower demand for labour, affecting wages and even eradicating jobs.

Meanwhile, the IMF projects that the technology will affect just 26% of jobs in low-income countries.

It echoes a report from Goldman Sachs in 2023, which estimated AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs - but said there may also be new jobs alongside a boom in productivity.

Ms Georgieva said ""many of these countries don't have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality among nations"".

More generally, higher-income and younger workers may see a disproportionate increase in their wages after adopting AI.

Lower-income and older workers could fall behind, the IMF believes.

""It is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programmes for vulnerable workers,"" Ms Georgieva said. ""In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.""

The IMF analysis comes as global business and political leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

AI is a topic of discussion, following the surge in popularity of applications like ChatGPT.

The technology is facing increased regulation around the world. Last month, European Union officials reached a provisional deal on the world's first comprehensive laws to regulate the use of AI.

China has introduced some of the world's first national regulations on AI, which include rules concerning how algorithms can be developed and deployed.

In October, President Biden signed an executive order compelling developers to share safety results relating to AI with the US government.","AI to hit 40% of jobs and worsen inequality, IMF saysBy Annabelle Liang Business reporterGetty ImagesArtificial intelligence is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs, according to a new analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

By Kathryn Armstrong BBC News

Dozens of vessels have been targeted by the Houthis in the Red Sea since November

A Malta-flagged, Greek-owned vessel has been hit with a missile in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, maritime security firm Ambrey has said.

It is thought to be the third incident involving the bulk carrier, believed to be named Zografia, in 24 hours.

Tuesday's incident comes as the US military announced it had seized Iranian-supplied weapons bound for the Houthis during an operation last week.

Meanwhile, the US has hit more targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

An official told CBS, the BBC's American partner, that the US conducted further strikes on Houthi positions overnight.

The US and UK launched a wave of airstrikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January following attacks by the Iran-backed group on shipping in the Red Sea.

It is not yet known what was attacked in the latest US operation.

The Houthis have vowed to retaliate and on Sunday the US said it had shot down a missile fired towards one of its warships from a Houthi area of Yemen.

Several vessels have been targeted by the movement's fighters since November in protest at Israel's war with Hamas.

The Houthis say they are targeting vessels which are Israeli-owned, flagged or operated, or are heading to Israeli ports. However, many have no connections with Israel.

The Red Sea connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal but several shipping lines have announced they are now diverting round the Cape of Good Hope to reach Europe instead.

US Central Command

The US said on Tuesday that analysis from the weapons it seized from a ship near the Yemen coast suggested the Houthis had been using the same kind of weapons in their Red Sea attacks.

The seizure took place on 11 January near the coast of Somalia - the same day as the first US-UK airstrikes.

Cruise and ballistic missile components were among the items found on a ship, as well as parts for air defence equipment.

""This is the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons (ACW) to the Houthis since the beginning of Houthi attacks against merchant ships in November 2023,"" US Central Command said in a statement.

It also said a search is continuing for two Navy Seals who were lost overboard during the operation.","Red Sea attacks: Greek vessel hit by missile - reportsBy Kathryn Armstrong BBC NewsGetty ImagesDozens of vessels have been targeted by the Houthis in the Red Sea since NovemberA Malta-flagged, Greek-owned vessel has been hit with a missile in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, maritime security firm Ambrey has said.

By Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent in Des Moines, Iowa

Watch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 seconds

It was perhaps the least surprising victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.

Donald Trump won by a landslide in the first contest in the Republican race for a presidential nominee, the margin in the end as comfortable as the polls had predicted for months.

But dominating the vote count was just one reason why the former president was celebrating on Monday night after his supporters braved extreme cold weather to deliver him the win.

Neither of Mr Trump's main rivals, Nikki Haley nor Ron DeSantis, emerged as a lead challenger - so the not-Trump vote remains divided. Meanwhile, his most ideologically similar rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, announced he was dropping out - and will endorse Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

Here is a closer look at why the results in Iowa were so significant in the race for the White House.

This is still Donald Trump's party

Mr Trump's victory in Iowa was historically massive. He won the most votes in all but one of Iowa's 99 counties (he lost the other by a single vote).

No one had prevailed in an Iowa contest by more than 12 points before - Mr Trump's margin will approach 30% and he could end up winning an outright majority of the Republicans who turned out.

With almost all the votes counted, Mr Trump had won 51%, with Mr DeSantis on 21% and Ms Haley on 19%.

A survey of Iowans entering caucus sites on Monday night helps explain exactly why his bid for an electoral encore has been successful so far.

About half of Republican caucus-goers consider themselves part of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" movement, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.

Mr Trump's victory was a broad one as well. He won the young and old, men and women. He also won over the evangelical and hard-right conservative voters he had difficulty winning in 2016.

Typically, defeated presidential candidates fade from memory, never able to shake the taint of the loss. Mr Trump, however, has managed to convince Republicans - here in Iowa and nationally - that he didn't lose.

A large majority of caucus-goers in Iowa told CBS they believed Mr Trump was the actual winner of the 2020 presidential election - a number that increased to 90% among Trump supporters.

Trump victory is a remarkable turnaround

Mr Trump's dominant position within the Republican Party has been irrefutable - but his win here, in the larger context of modern American politics, is extraordinary.

Three years ago, he ended his first presidential term under a cloud of controversy, his campaign to challenge his loss to Democrat Joe Biden culminating in the January 6 Capitol riot. He faces two criminal trials stemming from those actions.

Now, as the winner of the Iowa caucuses, he has taken the first significant step toward becoming the Republican Party's nominee in November's presidential election.

Trump still has work to do to become the Republican standard-bearer. He will face a more formidable challenge from Ms Haley in New Hampshire next week, where polls show his once dominating lead has been whittled to near single digits.

But he is still the overwhelming favourite in the race, endorsed in his first test by actual Republican voters.

No clear rival emerged from Iowa

Entering Monday's Iowa caucuses, most of the electoral intrigue involved which candidate would take second place behind Mr Trump. In the end, it was Mr DeSantis who walked away with the runner-up prize.

It's not much of an achievement, however, given the narrowness with which the Florida governor finished ahead of Ms Haley, after investing so much time and resources in Iowa.

The result, and Mr DeSantis's pledge to press on with his campaign, won't provide the kind of clear result that would set up a one-on-one face-off with Trump in the days ahead.

Getty Images

Trump supporters were jubilant

In fact, the result may make Trump's victory all the more potent, as his divide-and-conquer strategy is still fully in place as the Republican primary process kicks into gear.

The one candidate who did drop out, Mr Ramaswamy, will further clear the field for the former president, as public opinion surveys show that his supporters have Mr Trump as their second choice. While he only garnered about 8% in Iowa, every bit of backing counts, and Mr Ramaswamy's endorsement will offer Mr Trump yet another headline to boost him into New Hampshire.

The Iowa result will also let the former president further focus his fire on President Biden, something he eagerly did during his victory speech on Monday night. For their part, the Democrats seem to be welcoming the showdown and the opportunity to exploit what they see as Mr Trump's vulnerabilities.

A series of dominating wins, starting in Iowa, will give the former president momentum, however - and the air of a winner. By the time the autumn general election rolls around, Mr Trump may prove to be a more formidable adversary than they expected - or hoped.","Iowa caucuses: What Trump's dominant win means for his rivalsBy Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent in Des Moines, IowaWatch: The Iowa caucuses... a dramatic night in 82 secondsIt was perhaps the least surprising victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.

By Kathryn Armstrong BBC News

Golriz Ghahraman is a former United Nations human rights lawyer

A New Zealand MP has resigned following multiple allegations of shoplifting, which police are investigating.

Golriz Ghahraman, of the Green Party, is alleged to have stolen three times from two clothing stores - one in Auckland and the other in Wellington.

The former UN human rights lawyer made history in 2017 as the first refugee in the country's government. She once held her party's justice portfolio.

Work-related stress made her behave completely out of character, she said.

""I have let down a lot of people and I am very sorry,"" she added.

Ms Ghahraman fled Iran as a child with her family, who were all granted political asylum in New Zealand.

Her resignation on Tuesday comes after CCTV footage emerged showing her allegedly taking a designer handbag from an Auckland boutique.

The 42-year-old, who has not been charged with any crime, said in a statement her actions had ""fallen short"" of the high standards of behaviour the public expected from elected representatives.

""It's not a behaviour I can explain because it's not rational in any way, and after medical evaluation, I understand I'm not well,"" she said, adding that she did not want to make excuses for herself.

""The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma.""

Responding to her resignation, Green Party co-leader James Shaw said that Ms Ghahraman had been subject to ""pretty much continuous threats of sexual violence, physical violence, death threats since the day she was elected to Parliament"".

""That has added a higher level of stress than is experienced by most members of parliament,"" he said.

""There have been police investigations into those threats almost the entire time that she has been a member of parliament, and so obviously if you're living with that level of threat in what is already quite a stressful situation then there are going to be consequences for that"".

Ms Ghahraman has spoken out in the past about the abuse she has received both online and in person based on her Iranian heritage, her gender and the public stances she has taken on various issues.

""Eventually some of the online threats I faced got to the point where I had to carry a security alarm and have security escorts back and forth from Parliament,"" she told national broadcaster TVNZ in 2021.

In 2017, Ms Ghahraman was given an escort following threats by white supremacists.

More recently, she has been criticised for taking part in pro-Palestinian protests and for being critical of Israel's military actions in its war against Hamas in Gaza in her role as the Green Party's foreign affairs and human rights spokesperson.

Watch: Top moments from this year's Emmy Awards ceremony

Succession, Beef and The Bear were the big winners at the Emmy Awards, which took place on Monday in Los Angeles.

Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen all took home acting prizes for Succession, while the show also won best drama series overall.

Creator Jesse Armstrong said it was ""a great sadness to end the show, but it was a great pleasure to do it"".

Also at the ceremony, Sir Elton John won his first Emmy Award, finally giving him EGOT status.

That means he has joined an exclusive club of performers who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award.

Sir Elton missed the ceremony because he has recently had knee surgery

Elton Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium won best live variety special, marking the British singer-songwriter's first Emmy nomination and award.

However, Sir Elton could not pick up the honour after having a knee operation. He wrote on Instagram that he was ""on cloud nine"" after the win and joked that his knee problem was ""a gentle reminder, perhaps, of a lifetime spent jumping off pianos"".

He added: ""Honoured to have joined the hallowed ranks of EGOT winners, here's to the joy of music and the magic it brings to our lives!""

Other winners on the night included The White Lotus and Abbott Elementary.

Succession, the critically acclaimed drama about a media mogul and the power struggles between his dysfunctional family, concluded last year after four seasons.

It was rewarded generously at the Emmys, winning best drama series and prizes for writing and directing, while Snook and Culkin won best leading drama actress and actor for playing Shiv and Roman Roy respectively.

""The bar was set so high and that was what spurred us on,"" Snook said of Succession's success.

She also thanked her parents, telling them: ""Mum and dad - thank you for having a dress-up box when I was a kid, this is where it gets you!""

Snook dedicated the award to her daughter, commenting: ""The biggest thank you I think though is to someone who won't understand anything that I'm saying at the moment, but I carried her with me in this last season and really it was her who carried me.

""It's very easy to act when you're pregnant because you've got hormones raging and it was more that the proximity of her life growing inside me gave me the strength to do this and this performance.""

Co-star Culkin paid tribute to Armstrong ""for being a brilliant writer, showrunner and gentleman"".

Culkin also thanked his two children and wife, before addressing her from the stage: ""And Jazz, I want more [children]. You said maybe, if I won!""

He beat fellow Succession stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, who had also been nominated in the best drama actor category.

In his own acceptance speech, British actor Macfadyen, who played Shiv's husband Tom, joked: ""I must make special mention to my on-screen wife Sarah Snook, and my other on-screen wife Nicholas Braun.""

Braun, a fellow nominee, plays Cousin Greg in Succession, and the two characters' relationship was a favourite with viewers.

""Acting with you has been one of the most wonderful things in my career, so thank you Nick, thank you Sarah,"" Macfadyen added.

Armstrong, the Shropshire-born screenwriter who created the series, also scooped the top prize for best writing in a drama series.

In his speech, Armstrong referred back to the show's main plotline, joking: ""For some reason, the name of a certain Australia-born media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, springs to mind.""

He added: ""I come from the UK and the show is about things that are close to the centre of American life and politics, and we've always been met with generosity and good faith and that's part of America's tradition of being very welcoming to outsiders.""

Jeremy Allen White was named best comedy actor for his performance in The Bear

Elsewhere, The Bear - a comedy-drama series about a chef who returns home to run his family's sandwich shop - won three acting prizes, for its star Jeremy Allen White, and supporting actors Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.

Accepting his award, White said: ""I am so full of gratitude to be standing in front of you all - I love this show so much, it filled me up, set a fire in me.""

Edebiri told the audience: ""This is a show about found family and real family, and my parents are here tonight - thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and black and proud of all of that.""

Succession and The Bear won six prizes each in the drama and comedy categories respectively, while Netflix's road rage-inspired series Beef dominated the limited series categories.

By Jonathan Amos Science correspondent

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Richard Sidey

Wave action is cutting caves and arches in the walls of A23a

Erosion is sculpting dramatic features into the world's biggest iceberg in what's likely to be the final months of its existence.

A ship run by the Eyos expeditions company arrived at the frozen behemoth, A23a, on Sunday to find huge caves and arches cut into its frozen walls.

The berg is being ground down by the warmer air and surface waters it's encountering as it drifts slowly away from the White Continent.

Ultimately, it will melt and disappear.

""We saw waves, a good 3m or 4m high, smashing into the berg,"" said expedition leader Ian Strachan.

""These were creating cascades of ice - a constant state of erosion,"" he told BBC News.

Copernicus Data/Esa/Sentinel-3

Pictured from space: A23a is about 200km west of the South Orkney Islands, partially covered here by cloud

A23a broke away from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but it's only recently begun a big migration.

For more than 30 years, it was stuck rigidly in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea, like a static ""ice island"" measuring some 4,000 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in area. That's more than twice the size of Greater London.

The colossus is presently drifting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the great sweep of water that circles the continent in a clockwise direction.

This current, together with the prevailing westerlies, is pushing A23a in the general direction of the South Orkney Islands, which are about 600km (370 miles) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

The berg has entered what scientists refer to as ""iceberg alley"", a track that passes South Georgia

It is firmly in the track of what scientists refer to as ""iceberg alley"" - the major route for the export of ice from the continent.

The interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine its precise course over the coming weeks, but many of these giant flat-topped, or tabular, bergs end up passing by the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.

Their destiny is to fragment and wither to nothing. Their legacy is the ocean life they seed by dropping entrained mineral nutrients. From plankton up to great whales - all benefit from the melting bergs' fertilisation effect.

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Richard Sidey

A submerged terrace develops as the walls crumble. Buoyancy will force this terrace upwards

On Sunday, the Eyos team got close enough to A23a to put up a drone. The berg's 30m-high cliffs were topped by a dense mist. Icebergs on this scale create their own weather.

""It was dramatic and beautiful to photograph,"" said Eyos videographer Richard Sidey.

""It's mind-bogglingly big. I actually don't think we can fathom just how big it is; we can only know how big it is from science. It's certainly too big to photograph. It stretches as far as you can see in both directions.""

Satellite observations can monitor its area coverage and gauge its thickness, which is over 300m (980ft) in places. In terms of mass, it's not far off a trillion tonnes, although this will be decreasing day by day.

EYOS EXPEDITIONS/Ian Strachan

A dense mist hangs over A23a: It's so big it makes its own weather

The big question is: how long can A23a survive as it moves away from the colder climes of the Antarctic?

Milder air temperatures will create surface melt ponds that drain through the berg, helping to open up fractures. And those spectacular surface catacombs and arches will collapse to leave extensive areas of submerged ice that will then rise up under their own buoyancy to gnaw away at the berg's edges.

But another large block of ice ahead of A23a on the highway may be instructive in understanding its potential longevity.

Cinema heart-throb Alain Delon has for decades filled the front pages of French newspapers

The last of the male superstars from the golden era of French cinema is back on the front pages, but not for a new film, or a late-in-life marriage.

Once described as the most beautiful man in the movies, at 88 Alain Delon is old, sick and a virtual recluse.

The final tragic act of Delon's life, unfolding in the media before a public torn between horror and fascination, is the breakdown of his family.

His three children are fighting over the traces of memory and paternal love.

""Birds hide away in order to die. Big beasts do it under the full light of the projector,"" runs the first line of a long article in Le Monde newspaper dedicated to the saga.

It is a story, the newspaper says, with all the elements of Greek drama - a divided family, a tumbling mansion that was once the scene of glorious festivities.

And above all, a suffering protagonist confronted by the demons of his own turbulent past.

For the French, Delon is cinema's ultimate grand fauve (big beast) who charmed and seduced his way around Europe in the heady 1960s, appearing in hits like The Leopard and Rocco and his Brothers.

Toni Anne Barson/FilmMagic

Alain Delon, seen here in 2019, has since become a virtual recluse

For decades they have followed the ins and outs of his prolific career and equally prolific love life, via Paris-Match and other ""people"" magazines.

They knew that the actor had three children - two sons and a daughter - by two different women, and a third son unacknowledged and now dead.

But what they have discovered in the last two weeks is the trauma at the heart of the Delon family, as the surviving children laid their mutual grievances before the media in a series of insults, accusations, lawsuits and secret recordings.

First of all Anthony Delon, the 59-year-old son of actor Nathalie Delon, gave an interview to Paris-Match, accusing his younger half-sister Anouchka of ""lying"" and ""manipulation"" for hiding the results of cognitive tests on their father.

REPORTERS ASSOCIES/Gamma-Rapho

Anthony Delon, who was born in 1964, is seen here with Alain Delon's first wife Nathalie

Anouchka, 33 and daughter of Dutch model Rosalie van Breemen, counter-attacked in a communiqué issued by her lawyer, claiming that Delon could ""no longer endure the aggressivity of his son, who is constantly telling him he is senile"".

The pair then insulted each other some more in appearances on French TV, before the third child - Alain-Fabien who is 29 - stepped in on Instagram, taking his half-brother's side and playing a secret recording of Anouchka dripping (he claimed) insinuations into their father's ear.

The latest legal exchanges have been over medical treatment for Delon, who had a stroke in 2019 and is suffering from another serious condition, unnamed in French media. On Saturday a court-sanctioned doctor examined the actor, but his conclusions were immediately disputed by the children.

THOMAS SAMSON/AFP

Anthony Delon, here with his father in 2021, has accused his half-sister of lying and manipulation

And in the background hovers another plaintiff: 66-year-old Hiromi Rollin, Delon's former housekeeper or love-partner, depending on who you talk to. She was ejected in a rare display of unity by the children last year, but has now filed a suit against them for endangering Delon's life by refusing him medicines.

The action is all taking place in the mansion that Delon had built at Douchy, in a wooded estate 120km (75 miles) southeast of Paris. It is there that the ageing star lives with Alain-Fabien, receiving occasional visits from the other children.

Off-limits to the public, the place is - according to Alain-Fabien - a shadow of its former self. ""Everything keeps breaking down and the electricity doesn't work,"" he said.

According to all concerned, Alain Delon - though frail and often confused - is still lucid and grasps the enormity of what is happening to his family.

For Le Monde and other commentators, it is a tragedy whose roots lie deep in the actor's own past.

Patrice PICOT/Gamma-Rapho

Alain Delon and co-star Romy Schneider were together for several years although they never married

Delon's childhood and adolescence were vexatious and troubled, leaving him arguably incapable of establishing relationships with his sons.

Born in the outskirts of Paris in 1935, he was left with a foster family at the age of four when his parents divorced.

As a boy he was a rebellious truant. He joined the navy and saw action in Indochina, but was court-martialled for stealing a jeep. Back in Paris in the late 1950s, he lived among prostitutes and gangsters before his looks brought him to the world of film.

In the words of Le Monde: ""No doubt his ego - as uncertain as it was immense - made him consider his sons as potential rivals who he needed to smash in the egg.""

What is well-documented is that Delon as a father was extremely tough with his two boys, both of whom went on to have brushes with drugs, guns and the law.

VALERY HACHE/AFP

Anouchka Delon has long been Alain Delon's favourite child

With Anouchka, it was different. Of her he said in 2008, ""To no other woman have I so often said 'I love you'.""

His other son, by the German rock-star Nico of the Velvet Underground, also suffered. Born in 1962, Ari Boulogne was never acknowledged by Delon.

But Delon's own mother, believing he was indeed his child, helped bring him up. He died last year in Paris after an apparent overdose.

Delon has arranged his will so that half of his estate goes to Anouchka, and the other half is shared between the two boys.

But everyone seems to agree that the rift among the siblings is not about the money.","Alain Delon: Tragic finale as film great's family is torn apartBy Hugh Schofield BBC News, ParisGilbert TOURTE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesCinema heart-throb Alain Delon has for decades filled the front pages of French newspapersThe last of the male superstars from the golden era of French cinema is back on the front pages, but not for a new film, or a late-in-life marriage.

By Lora Jones Business reporter, BBC News

Uniqlo's nylon cross-body bag has been a huge hit online

Uniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast fashion giant is selling copycats of its viral ""Mary Poppins"" shoulder bag.

The legal case filed in Tokyo alleges that some Shein bags ""closely resemble"" Uniqlo's own and could dent customer confidence in the brand.

Uniqlo's cross-body bag has been a huge hit online, with TikTokkers showing off how many items they can fit in it.

Shein did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Uniqlo is demanding that Shein stops selling its version of the bag immediately, as well as asking for ""compensation for damages incurred"".

Uniqlo's owner, Fast Retailing, said on Tuesday that a petition had been filed in the Tokyo District Court against Shein Japan and two subsidiaries in late December.

Videos of the bag have generated millions of ""likes"" online over the past year, with one jokey post showing a user taking out a laptop, water bottle, candle and even a robot vacuum and toolkit.

It has been likened to the magical carpet bag carried by Mary Poppins who, in the eponymous 1964 musical, pulls a hat stand and lampshade out of her holdall.

The nylon ""round mini shoulder bag"", costing £14.90 in the UK, has reportedly become the brand's best-selling bag ever.

Shein, founded in 2008 in China, saw sales surge during the pandemic, fuelled by a jump in online shopping and its social media-focussed marketing strategy.

According to its website, the company employs nearly 10,000 people worldwide and sells to more than 150 countries.

It is now based in Singapore and reports have been circulating that it is considering a stock exchange listing in New York.

It has, however, attracted controversy. Low prices have raised questions about the company's environmental footprint and employment practices, but Shein says it produces clothes in small batches, which is more efficient and means little goes to waste, and that it has zero tolerance policy on forced labour.

It has also seen accusations made online by smaller business owners over claims that their products have been copied by the fashion giant, although it has said that it ""respects designers and artists, and the intellectual property rights of others"".

Fast Retailing, Japan's biggest clothing seller, opened the first Uniqlo store in 1984 and now operates some 2,500 around the world, many of them in China.

Uniqlo has gained a reputation for practical clothes offered up in a number of different colours, with a focus on thermals and coats in particular.

In its latest financial update, Uniqlo's owner reported profits of 146.7 billion yen (£791m) in the three months to the end of November, compared with 117.1bn yen a year before which has been fuelled by overseas sales.","Uniqlo sues Shein over claims firm copied viral shoulder bagBy Lora Jones Business reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesUniqlo's nylon cross-body bag has been a huge hit onlineUniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast fashion giant is selling copycats of its viral ""Mary Poppins"" shoulder bag.

By George Wright & David Gritten BBC News

AFP

Authorities in Iraq's Kurdistan Region said four people were killed in the overnight strikes

The US has condemned Iran over ballistic missile strikes on Iraq's northern city of Irbil on Monday night, calling them ""reckless and imprecise"".

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they struck what they claimed were an Israeli ""spy headquarters"" in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region.

Four civilians were killed and six hurt in the attack, local authorities said.

Iraq recalled its ambassador from Tehran, condemning the strikes as a ""blatant violation"" of sovereignty.

There has been no comment from Israel.

The Revolutionary Guards also said they carried out missile strikes on ""terrorist bases"" in Syria in response to a recent suicide bombing in Iran claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.

In a separate development on Tuesday morning, Kurdish counter-terrorism forces said they had shot three armed drones flying over Irbil's airport, where US and international forces are stationed, Reuters news agency reported.

There was no immediate claim, but an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has said it was behind similar attacks.

The Iranian strikes come amid heightened tensions across the Middle East since the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas began on 7 October.

Iran has declared that it does not want to get involved in a wider conflict, but groups in its so-called ""Axis of Resistance"" have been carrying out attacks on Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians.

Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has exchanged cross-border fire with Israeli forces; Shia militias have launched drones and missiles at US forces in Iraq and Syria; and Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked ships in the Red Sea.

Israel has reportedly carried out strikes that killed a Hamas leader in Lebanon and a Revolutionary Guards commander in Syria, while the US has killed an Iraqi militia leader in an air strike in Iraq and bombed Houthi targets in Yemen.

Anadolu

Iraq's government condemned Iran's ""aggression"" on Irbil

The Kurdistan Region Security Council said multiple ballistic missiles launched by the Revolutionary Guards struck civilian-populated areas of Irbil around 23:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday.

Local news outlet Rudaw reported that loud explosions shook the city and that several residential buildings on the road between Irbil and the north-eastern suburb of Pirmam were damaged heavily.

Peshraw Dizayee, a multimillionaire real estate magnate, was killed when a missile hit his home, the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party said.

An 11-month-old baby was also among the dead, according to Rudaw.

The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that the missile strikes were a ""response to the recent evil acts of the Zionist regime in martyring [Revolutionary Guards] and resistance commanders"".

The missiles ""destroyed one of the main headquarters of Israel's spy agency Mossad in Iraq's Kurdistan Region"", which had been used to ""develop espionage operations and plan acts of terrorism"", they claimed.

However, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said it categorically rejected ""this unfounded pretext"" and accused the Revolutionary Guards of frequently employing ""baseless pretexts for assaulting Irbil"" when it posed no threat.

The Kurdistan Region's Prime Minister, Masrour Barzani, condemned the ""cowardly attack"" and urged the federal government in Baghdad to ""to take a principled position against the flagrant violation of Iraq's and the Kurdistan Region's sovereignty"".

The Iraqi foreign ministry said the government ""strongly denounced the Iranian aggression on Irbil"" and would ""take all legal measures against it"", including filing a complaint to the UN Security Council. It also announced the formation of an investigative committee to ""prove the falsity"" of Iran's claims.

Later, the ministry recalled the Iraqi ambassador from Tehran for consultations and summoned Iran's charge d'affaires in Baghdad to protest.

""We will continue to assess the situation, but initial indications are that this was a reckless and imprecise set of strikes,"" Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement.

""The United States supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq,"" she said, adding that no US personnel or facilities were targeted.

The UN mission in Iraq said: ""Attacks, by any side, violating Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity must stop. Security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.""

The Iranian foreign ministry said it respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries but was using its ""legitimate and legal right to deter national security threats"".

In 2022, the Revolutionary Guards carried out a similar missile attack on what it claimed was an Israeli ""strategic centre"" in Irbil following an air strike in Syria that killed two senior Iranian officers. Later in the year, they hit what they said were the bases of Iranian Kurdish opposition groups in the region.

The Revolutionary Guards also said they had targeted the positions of IS and other ""terrorist groups"" in Syria's opposition-controlled Idlib province on Monday night.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said it was not clear where the missiles landed. Four explosions were heard south-east of the city of Aleppo, within areas controlled by Iran-backed militias, and one blast was heard near the city of Idlib, it added.

White Helmets first responders said a non-functioning medical clinic in the village of Taltita in Idlib province had been destroyed by explosions of unknown origin. Two people suffered minor injuries, they added.

The Revolutionary Guards said the strikes in Syria were in retaliation for this month's suicide bombing that targeted crowds marking the fourth anniversary of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's assassination by the US.","US condemns Iran for 'reckless' missile strikes on northern IraqBy George Wright & David Gritten BBC NewsAFPAuthorities in Iraq's Kurdistan Region said four people were killed in the overnight strikesThe US has condemned Iran over ballistic missile strikes on Iraq's northern city of Irbil on Monday night, calling them ""reckless and imprecise"".

""Welcome back to Kyrgyzstan,"" says Shukur Shermatov, addressing a class of 20 women. He is wearing a traditional felt cap, but there is nothing traditional about this school. It sits inside two rings of military security and the students are women who have been brought home from camps in Syria, where they ended up after living with the Islamic State group.

The rehabilitation centre is woven into the mountains of northern Kyrgyzstan, and it is where wives and children of suspected IS recruits spend their first six weeks after being repatriated.

Our BBC World Service team are among the first visitors, and like the residents, everything we say and do is closely monitored by the state intelligence agency.

The women listen to Shukur attentively as he takes them through their first lesson. The course covers citizenship, religious ethics, and anger management. Posters on the wall offer tips on how to control your emotions.

As well as the re-education programme, the families receive medical treatment, psychological support, and - for the first time in years for many - sufficient food, water, and shelter.

Some countries have balked at repatriating women such as these - women who say they followed husbands, fathers and brothers into a war zone unknowingly. What happened to them there - what they did, how much they knew - has been hidden in the wreckage of the so-called caliphate. Decisions on whether they are victim or perpetrator now have to be made by officials, potentially thousands of miles away.

The Kyrgyz government has, at least for now, decided to treat them as the former - albeit, cautiously. Nine out of 10 are under police investigation.

After the lesson, we are led into a simple dormitory with four single beds, where we meet a woman draped in a purple hijab. We are calling her Fatima, not her real name, for her safety. Through a small window, the snowy lakeside landscape could not look more different to the Syrian camp she has left behind.

""The main thing here is that it's calm. Everyone is so grateful for that. The children love it."" She pauses and appreciates the silence. ""The calm.""

Fatima followed her husband to Turkey in 2013 when he said he wanted to work there. The whole family went, including Fatima's two adult sons, her daughter and a grandchild. She says she only realised they were in Syria when she heard the roar of jet planes overhead and saw IS guards.

We asked whether she really had no idea where they were going and, like many of the women we met, she insisted she was unaware and it was normal for a woman to follow her husband.

Within days of their arrival in Syria, she had lost her husband and son. Her husband burned to death after a bomb hit his car, while her son was shot by a sniper. Shortly afterwards, her other son fell ill and died.

Fatima is one of 110 women brought back from Syria in 2023 as part of Kyrgyzstan's rehabilitation programme

Unable to leave, the women spent nearly six years under brutal IS rule in Iraq and Syria, where Fatima's daughter had more children. When IS fighters were driven out, Fatima, her daughter and four grandchildren ended up in al-Hol, Syria's largest detention camp for suspected IS fighters and their families. They spent four years there, desperate to come home.

""Women were sick and children were crying all the time. We were begging them to let us leave,"" she says. ""We barely survived. When people from Kyrgyzstan came to collect the first group, everyone was in shock.""

In October, her daughter and grandchildren were told they were being repatriated, but not Fatima.

""I cried when they told me I wasn't on the list. How wasn't I on the list? I'm their mother!"" she sobs. ""But now that I am here and will soon be back with my family, I am so happy. I'm glad my grandchildren can have an education. I want them to study science, to understand the world better.""

At 57, Fatima is the oldest person in the rehabilitation centre, one of 110 mothers and 229 children Kyrgyzstan brought back from Syria in 2023 as part of a new repatriation operation. Only Iraq repatriated more last year.

Kyrgyzstan plans to bring back at least another 260 women and children, after years of campaigning by relatives of people stuck in Syria. The aim is to give people the government believes may have been victims a second chance.

Even so, the returnees are all interrogated and remain under regular surveillance after finishing the reintegration course. Nine in 10 are facing criminal investigations, the head of the Kyrgyz national security council told us. Potential charges could include assisting terrorism or transporting children to a war zone. As yet, however, no-one has been prosecuted.

The continued surveillance, and potential of criminal proceedings, mean the women are often reluctant to talk about their time in Syria.

After Elmira, who has passed through the rehabilitation centre and is now rebuilding her life in a town outside the capital, Bishkek, agrees to speak to us, we get a glimpse of what this monitoring looks like.

Soon after we arranged to see her, we were phoned by her social worker, notifying us that she would be present at the interview too. When we arrived, two counter-terror police officers, whom the family recognised, were there as well. After some discussion, they agreed to wait outside.

The snowy landscape of Kyrgyzstan is very different to the Syrian camps where many of the women were living

Elmira claims she was tricked into going to Syria by a man she met online. He convinced her to join him in Turkey and, thinking they would be happy together, four days after her 18th birthday she flew out to meet him.

But when she got there, she was greeted by a different man who said he was his friend and took her on a 17-hour drive across the Syrian border. She claims that by the time she realised what was happening, it was too late to turn back.

She married twice. Her first husband died after a couple of months, then she married a man from Dagestan and had his child. She won't say any more about what he was doing in Syria but explains they were looking for a way out before he died in a rocket attack.

Elmira says the hardest moment was when she thought her daughter might be dead. She had gone out, leaving her little girl at home, when rockets hit their neighbourhood. Terrified for her child, Elmira ran home in tears.

""Then someone brought her out, alive, healthy, and she was just afraid. The neighbour's house had been hit and other children who were nearby died.""

Like Fatima, Elmira and her daughter ended up in al-Hol camp.

""I still can't believe it. Sometimes I wake up at night and don't know if I'm dreaming,"" she tells us. ""I'm so grateful to everyone who helped get us out of there and didn't abandon us. We know that not every country does that.""

Elmira, who is now training as a seamstress, asked us not to disclose her real name. After seeing the response to the repatriations from some Kyrgyz people on social media, she has decided not to tell anyone about her past.

""It isn't pleasant,"" she says. ""A lot of us don't understand why they are afraid of us. We are afraid of them! People think we have come back here with machine guns and suicide belts. It's not like that. We are people just like they are. We also have families. We also have children. And we also want to lead peaceful and happy lives.""

""And why tell people, when I myself want to forget?"" Elmira adds. ""I was 18 then. I'm 27 now. I've learned not to be so naïve.""

Elmira's mother, Hamida Yusupova, spent the past decade pleading with the Kyrgyz authorities to bring back her daughter and granddaughter, and founded a campaign group for parents of girls who went to Syria.

""We know that Syria can be a one-way trip. You start to realise that your child might never make it back home,"" she says.

""I thank God, that she's back home and, finally, I've met my granddaughter. But Elmira has lost nine years of her youth. It's a long time.""

When Hamida came to collect them from the rehabilitation centre, their reunion was filled with more tears than words.

""Elmira had become a mother. She understood how hard it is when you raise a child for 18 years and, one day, they tell you they're 'going to work', shut the door, and disappear to Syria. I wouldn't wish it on any mother,"" Hamida says.

""All Elmira could say was: 'Mum, forgive me, forgive me.' Nothing else. Apart from, then she told me how much I had aged!""

Elmira and Hamida are well aware that not everyone around them will be forgiving.

Like many of its central Asian neighbours, Kyrgyzstan - where 90% of the population identify as Muslim - was a major source of recruits for IS, a UN-designated terrorist group, during its rise to prominence.

Hamida feels her daughter was a victim of manipulative men and guilty only of being gullible. However, we spoke to Kyrgyz women the same age as Elmira who said they felt anxious that the returnees could radicalise others, especially after seeing how the Taliban retook Afghanistan.

""As a mum, I've heard a lot of insults and slurs. I don't want my child to have to hear that. I don't want people to point fingers at my child and call her a terrorist,"" Hamida says.

Hamida Yusupova founded a campaign group for parents of girls who went to Syria

Deputy Prime Minister Edil Baisalov is keen to showcase the repatriation policy as proof that Kyrgyzstan is a tolerant democracy that looks after all of its citizens.

""I believe that the best thing is that they forget the nightmare they have been through, and that nobody in their families and communities remembers this situation. That everyone is just a good citizen of Kyrgyzstan,"" he tells us.

Mr Baisalov knows this is a contentious subject, particularly in some Western countries. A former ambassador to the UK, he was in post shortly after Shamima Begum, one of three London schoolgirls who left to join IS, had her British citizenship revoked.

The deputy prime minister also wanted to send a political message. Human rights groups have questioned Kyrgyzstan's reputation as an island of democracy in central Asia since disputed elections in 2020 and the introduction of new laws.

""For Kyrgyzstan, this was not an easy decision,"" he said. ""Of course, our kind of Islam is not radical. It is a very tolerant Islam, respectful of other religions. We are a small nation that needs to take care of each other. Even of those who commit mistakes.""

The scheme is supported by the UN children's agency Unicef and Sylvi Hill, who lead their repatriation efforts in Kyrgyzstan, describes it as ""commendable"". She says Unicef is calling for ""all governments to facilitate the return, rehabilitation and reintegration of their children affected by conflict"".","Women and children who went to live with IS in Syria are being brought homeBy Eleanora Kulenbekova and Daniel Wittenberg BBC World Service, KyrgyzstanBBCShukur Shermatov teaches repatriated women of suspected IS recruits""Welcome back to Kyrgyzstan,"" says Shukur Shermatov, addressing a class of 20 women.

In 1997 Captain Charles Moore was sailing from Hawaii to California when he noticed a steady stream of plastics bobbing in the ocean. He had discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Over a thousand miles from land in the central North Pacific Ocean, the boat captain and oceanographer Captain Charles Moore puzzled over the source of the litter.

""It can't be a trail of breadcrumbs like Hansel and Gretel leading me home,"" he recalled thinking. ""This has got to be a larger phenomenon.""

After two years of research and modelling, he returned to investigate. ""That's when we had the aha moment,"" he says. Using a net system to sample the surface of the ocean, he found six times as much plastic as plankton floating in the ocean.

Moore had discovered the largest of five garbage patches around the world. Created by swirling ocean currents known as gyres, these act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly.

Swirling ocean currents act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly

Since its discovery, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been depicted in the media as a floating mass of plastic, and referred to as a trash island. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no surface on which to stand and it can't be seen from space.

""It wasn't a mountain of trash, or a field of trash, it wasn't even a patch of trash,"" says Moore. Instead, the ocean looked like a murky soup, made up of different sized plastics.

This makes visualising the patch difficult. ""There is no such thing as a photo of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,"" says Moore. Satellites, drones and Google Earth struggle to capture an overview of the highly mobile garbage patch, he says.

In the following 25 years, our understanding of garbage patches has deepened, with some attempting to quantify and clean them up. But many misconceptions still exist about these remote garbage patches, where few people can venture themselves.

In 2017, an advertising stunt for World Oceans Day contributed to this perception, by calling on the United Nations to rename the GPGP Trash Isles. The campaign rallied to make the area the world's 196th country, fit with its own flag, passports and currency.

Although this raised the profile of the world's plastic problem, it played into myths surrounding the GPGP. A Google Image search still incorrectly reveals pictures of the GPGP as a solid mass of plastics, in some cases appearing almost sturdy enough to walk across.

In reality, ships can sail in and out, and mariners may not even release they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies indicate that – while more than 75% of the total mass of the garbage found in the GPGP is of debris greater than 5cm (1.9 in) in size – microplastics account for 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces floating in the area.

Common misconceptions can dampen the urgency to treat garbage patches. ""The problem is that most people are not aware of the issue, therefore they don't feel motivated enough to be engaged in solutions,"" says Walter Leal, a professor of Environment and Technology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK.

Left unchecked, more trash will accumulate in garbage patches. ""Indeed, they are growing bigger as we speak,"" says Leal. One 2021 paper predicts that the growth rate is 2.5% based on current trends – but the authors of the report warn that is a conservative estimate.

Ocean plastic can generate a host of environmental hazards, from the entanglement of creatures such as turtles, to consumption by birds and fish as it is mistaken for food.

The problem is so widespread it has given rise to the ""plastisphere"" – a term used for ecosystems that have evolved to live in human-made plastic environments.

In a recent study, researchers identified 484 invertebrates from around 100 pieces of plastic fished from the GPGP. Ocean currents had transported some species away from their natural habitat to live on plastics in the patch, risking strange mutations or biohazards.

Garbage patches accumulate in the high seas – the parts of the ocean that are beyond territorial waters – so few governments will take responsibility for them. However, the problem is becoming harder to ignore, says Leal.

Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.

On a recent trip to the South Pacific Leal recalls seeing plastic wash up on the shores of island nations such as Fiji, The Cook Islands and Vanuatu. ""These countries produce no plastic, but some plastics from the gyres find the way to the coast. That will also have an impact on tourism,"" he adds.

In the absence of government action, others have made it their mission to clear up garbage patches. One of the most famous attempts is by The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organisation founded by Dutch entrepreneur Boyan Slat.

At the age of 16, a high-school research paper on the GPGP coincided with a personal awakening about marine litter. ""I went scuba diving in Greece and I saw more plastic bags than fish,"" says Slat.

He scribbled a drawing on a paper napkin, which became the foundation of his tech-powered plan to clear the GPGP. Since then, The Ocean Cleanup has raked in millions of dollars of investment from donors such as the band Coldplay and The Coca-Cola Company.

""The solution is 50% hardware and 50% software,"" Slat says. System 03 – the latest iteration – uses computer modelling to map high-density plastic hotspots and steer the removal technology.

A long u-shaped, net-like barrier ""five school buses in length"" is dragged through patches of rubbish by two boats.

The goal is to scale up and clean 90% of the patch's plastic by 2040 – although some experts have questioned the plan's feasibility, stating that using boats to transport plastic from ocean garbage patches to ports could have a high carbon cost.

""It's crazy to think if we didn't pull this stuff out it would be out there killing sea life. Imagine if we were doing this in reverse, how much outrage that would spark across the world,"" says Slat.

You might also like:

Whether technology is the answer or not, experts are in agreement that reducing plastic production will be a key driver in limiting garbage patches.

One ""silver lining,"" says Leal, is an international plastics treaty, which will be negotiated in 2024.

The treaty will see 175 nations develop a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution to prevent new plastics ending up in the ocean and reaching garbage patches.

But for Captain Moore, agreeing to stymy plastic at the source has been a long time coming. ""Plastic production is going up and that's the opposite of a solution,"" he says. ""The solutions will involve reducing the amount of plastic produced.""

As virtual reality companies hunt for ways to spread their tech, they may find an unexpected audience for wide-scale adoption: Swifties.

The unprecedented popularity of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has inspired fans to spend thousands on tickets, while its cinematic debut broke box office records. Now, some experts in the virtual reality (VR) space are hopeful it will also inspire her fans – ""Swifties"" – to adopt the immersive technology platform.

Along with stadiums and cinemas across the globe, The Eras Tour is also streaming on Amazon's Prime Video app. Soon after its release fans discovered that, like much of Prime Video's content library, they could stream the film in their own private virtual theatres through Prime Video's VR app on a Meta Quest.

On TikTok and other social media platforms, videos of Swifties singing along while wearing the headsets have gone viral. This has led some industry insiders to suggest the cinematic experience of the top grossing tour in music history could also catalyse the mass adoption they've been clawing for.

Technological limitations have fed into this slow uptake, but prohibitively high costs have also been a major factor. It wasn't until 2016 when the Facebook-acquired Oculus Rift became the first commercially-viable VR product, hitting store shelves at $600 (£470). Prices have since come down: the mixed-reality headset Meta Quest 3, released in October 2023, is priced at $499 (£391); its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2, is widely available at $249 (£198). (Other VR headsets are still extremely expensive: Apple's Vision Pro, launching February, begins at $3,499 (£2,741).)

Typically, the cost of attending a concert is a fraction of a new piece of hardware, but the Eras Tour has flipped that equation on its head. With resale tickets averaging more than $3,800 (£2,977) each, VR-industry insiders say there's reason to believe Swift's unprecedented popularity could finally provide an answer to the barriers of both content and cost.

""Buying a VR headset for $400 might sound unreasonably high, but if you think about buying it as an alternative to experiencing a Taylor Swift concert… $400 sounds like a reasonable alternative,” says Rolf Illenberger, the CEO Munich-based VRdirect, which helps organisations create virtual experiences. ""The price point for a Taylor Swift fan is not a limiting factor to watch the superstar over and over again in this immersive experience.""

Taylor Swift is a killer app for virtual reality. It was a big signal to me, and really reaffirmed that powerful IP is a necessary ingredient to attract folks to a brand-new device category – Tom Emrich

Now that VR headsets are more functional and affordable, many in the field believe the main missing ingredient is a piece of software or content so popular it inspires the average person to purchase a new hardware device.

""Taylor Swift is a killer app for virtual reality,"" says VR expert and unabashed Swiftie Tom Emrich, who was ecstatic to see his two passions collide on social media over the holidays. ""It was a big signal to me, and really reaffirmed that powerful IP is a necessary ingredient to attract folks to a brand-new device category.""

Emrich, 45, who serves as the director of product and augmented reality platforms for San Francisco-based Niantic Labs – the company that brought the world Pokémon Go – notes that The Eras Tour Concert Film was filmed in 2D, not VR with cameras. Instead of immersing fans in a concert experience that makes them feel like they're sitting front row, he says the experience is more like being immersed in a movie theatre, with the Eras Tour film playing on screen.

""That's just the base level experience that you're going to be able to get in virtual reality,"" he says. Simply, this means content will only get better as events are captured using 3D filming technology – such as a 2023 Megan Thee Stallion concert experience, or an upcoming Doja Cat event – which were designed to make fans feel like they're standing on stage next to their favourite artist.

""I'm really excited for Swifties to eventually be able to experience Taylor Swift concerts made for VR,"" says Emrich. He adds that no such project has been confirmed, but says he remains optimistic one will emerge, given how excited fans were to watch the 2D version in VR.

The industry has tried to spark mass adoption through entertainment before. In recent years, live sporting events in VR have been met with similar excitement, but ultimately little uptake. In March 2023, for example, ESPN shared a TikTok video of a fan enjoying a courtside perspective of a live National Basketball Association (NBA) game from their living room. Despite racking up more than four million views and more than 330,000 likes on TikTok alone, it did not trigger mass adoption among sports fans.

Illinberger, however, argues that concerts are better suited to the medium. That's because, unlike a live sporting event, they can be edited and touched up with CGI after filming to enhance the viewer experience. Plus, sporting events are filled with stops and starts, during which time fans often chat with each other, use other devices, eat and drink or use the toilet, none of which is convenient with a headset on.

""For concerts like Taylor Swift… it comes back to immersive-ness,"" he says. ""The Taylor Swift fan wants to experience the concert as much as possible, and that's what VR can deliver.""","Now, some experts in the virtual reality (VR) space are hopeful it will also inspire her fans – ""Swifties"" – to adopt the immersive technology platform.

Want to take a selfie? In Berlin, where privacy, living in the moment and counterculture are highly valued, the answer may be ""no"".

It was 01:00, raining and just 2C, but Café Luzia was buzzing. The bar in Berlin's trendy Kreuzberg neighbourhood was alive with pre-club revellers wrapped up in big coats talking loudly in front of the graffitied mirrors and surreptitiously lighting cigarettes on open candles.

""Let's get a selfie!"" said a girl at our corner table, extending her arm to capture the group. She was from Paris, on her first trip to the German capital. We laughed and complied, edging together for the shot. As our group settled back, a friend – who has lived here on and off for years – said, ""It's quite funny; here in Berlin, it's not really done to take selfies.""

This wasn't the first time I'd heard this since coming to Berlin six months ago. Here, I've noticed distinctly fewer people posing with their phone cameras in public, with selfies seen as self-indulgent. In my hometown of Sydney, with its world-famous harbour and countless alluring beaches, selfies for social media feel like a fun addition to the everyday. In Berlin, it seemed much rarer.

It's not news that Germans more widely value their privacy to a high degree. According to 2017 research from the University of Hohenheim on attitudes, behaviours and perceptions of privacy, German citizens disclose personal information ""quite rarely"". And when it comes to sharing photos of themselves on social networks, such as a selfie on Instagram, the researchers found that ""only a few Germans"" found it ""useful"" to do so. ""The highest percentage [was] found among the youngest participants (7%),"" the report noted.

""Germany is one of those countries where privacy concerns are noticeably more pronounced,"" said Philipp Masur, co-author of the 2017 report and assistant professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where he studies digital communication and the impact of social media on our daily lives. ""In [the former] East Germany, [pronounced state surveillance] may have led people to be slightly more concerned about issues related to privacy.""

Until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Berlin was split between the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the East and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the West. As such, Berlin residents, as well as other residents of the GDR, were subject to extensive surveillance by the Ministry for State Security – also known as the Stasi.

Under surveillance? Today, visitors from the former GDR and beyond can visit Berlin's Stasi Museum as a reminder of the severely intrusive surveillance network, and even go to the Stasi Records Archive in Berlin to see if the Stasi had a file on them.

But while this history could go some way in explaining a contemporary concern over online privacy from state actors or even a lingering anti-capitalist distrust of large companies – and what they might be doing with data uploaded to their platforms – there may be more to this avoidance of taking selfies in public in Berlin.

Many Berlin residents I spoke to believe that their ""no-selfie"" culture developed via its famous club scene – whose hallowed venues seek to maintain an air of secrecy online and encourage partiers to revel in the moment. I'd been surprised when I first arrived in the city to see signs with a slashed cross through a camera at almost all the clubs I visited. But I've now got used to the fact that I cannot take photos inside and must either put my smartphone away or place a sticker over its lens.

That's because not only are Berlin's clubs home to some of the world's best techno music, but they are also considered an outlier in terms of what they provide for their patrons: a place where people are liberated to act in a way that is not always accepted in public. No more is this more obvious than in the nightclubs that market themselves as safe spaces, specifically created for the enjoyment of counterculture movements including the LGBTQI+ community, the kink scene and sex-positive groups.

Berghain (widely seen to have championed the no-photo rule when it brought it in, circa 2006), ://about blank and Sisyphos, remain the best-known clubs with an aversion to photography in Berlin. Another standout example is KitKat, a famously sex-positive club in Mitte. Here, guests are encouraged to wear fetish, patent and leather, glamour clothes and more, and are allowed to have sex on site.

""It's not a big mystery,"" said the official KitKat account, when I reached out to them on Instagram to ask why they don't allow photos inside, barring occasional, select events. ""The ban is on the one hand a protection of our guests, and… a protection of the atmosphere and concept of the club. Without it, most people would probably behave different[ly].""

In short, it's a way to allow their patrons to act out their desires without fears of repercussion in the outside world.

Marta Lodolr, a performance artist and nine-year Berlin resident, says she believes that for a major city in Europe, Berlin feels like a small city with a ""high level of freedom"" to enjoy the moment in shared spaces. ""There's so many things that can be [experienced] outside of the online world,"" she said, adding that it isn't just clubs that demand its patrons don't take photos. ""[It's] also [in] other places that, for respect of the people who go in, or for the respect of the place itself, selfies are not allowed.""

Indeed, this desire to live in the moment is something that's evident in other spaces in the city. In my frequent summer visits to ​​sunbathe at the popular Badeschiff pool on the River Spree, I'd seen signs at the entry saying photography wasn't allowed – a public digital detox I'd have thought unthinkable as a frequent Sydney beachgoer. And unlike music venues in most every other city, you'll almost never see a sea of people holding up their cameras to film musicians performing concerts in Berlin.

In addition, while there isn't an outright ban, Berlin is home to highly solemn post-war spaces – such as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Mitte – where photography is seen as highly inappropriate, if not forbidden.

""In London, I definitely see more people posting about day-to-day life things,"" said Claudia Hampton, a Berlin-based photographer and documentary filmmaker who is originally from London and believes casual self-documentation in Berlin isn't valued nearly as much as in the UK capital. ""When [a friend] is at the pub with a pint, or with their dog, you'll see it in their story. I don't see that that much [in Berlin].""

Hampton also says that in addition to Berlin residents finding it inappropriate or self-indulgent to post about their day-to-day activities, taking selfies here can simply be kind of awkward. ""People would think it's lame – but I do it sometimes.""

Could Berlin's values of privacy and freedom from photography be eroded by the increasing pressure in other cities for professionals to have an active online presence, I wondered? ""Basically I think that the city is becoming more [like] another European city,"" said Lodolr, referring to what she sees as a gradual shift away from more anti-capitalist attitudes in Berlin. ""Before, this kind of level of freedom was, let's say, spread in prices, rent and communities. More investors are interested in buying buildings in the city.""

Indeed, according to Masur, privacy concerns within Germany are getting more in line with other countries. ""One of my assumptions would be that it has to do with the advancement of globalisation. We're more exposed to other people, meaning [convergence] to a certain degree.""

Take Berlin-based fashion social influencer and businesswoman Amelie Stanescu, who frequently posts her selfies to 64,000 followers on her Instagram. ""People stare a lot in Berlin,"" she said to me over coffee in a trendy Prenzlauer Berg cafe, as we talked about the different social attitudes towards selfies between her adopted city of nine years and her Italian hometown. She says Berlin remains at the point where taking selfies in public is still seen as a little unusual.

I don't think they stare because they think you're doing something lame or whatever. I think they're just staring to see what you're doing

""I don't think they stare because they think you're doing something lame or whatever. I think they're just staring to see what you're doing.""

But she says that despite any awkwardness, she still takes selfies in public for her channels and to be successful in her job. ""I do it for work and I enjoy it,"" she said. ""At this point of my life and my career, I cannot think or consider other people's feelings when I do my work.""

It's an understandable and practical attitude in an increasingly international world that often requires visual self-disclosure for success. So, will these changes ever wear down this free-spirited city's aversion to selfies?

I hope not. I have grown to love Berlin's liberating attitude, which results in not feeling the pressure to document my night out or post to prove to others that I'm really having fun. Instead, my days – and particularly my nights out – have become cherished spaces in which to create memories worth remembering, and not ones where I need to take photos to do so.

The hit remake has been described as ""too nice"" compared to the 2004 original starring Lindsay Lohan – but does the new movie just offer its own, more contemporary version of meanness?

""This isn't your mother's Mean Girls,"" announces the trailer for the new musical-movie remake of the 2004 classic, which is currently topping the US box office. If ""not your mother's Mean Girls"" means it's a departure from the problematic jokes that were a hallmark of the noughties (and of Tina Fey, who wrote the original, the Broadway musical from which the new version is an adaptation of and this current iteration), then it certainly delivers on that promise for Gen Z.

More like this:

A quick, relatively spoiler-free rundown of some of the big changes: much of the cast are queer people of colour, including Damian (Jacquel Spivey) and Janis (Auli'i Cravalho), from whose perspective the story is told. Cady (Angourie Rice) has transferred from being homeschooled specifically in Kenya instead of the monolithic Africa (and Kevin G nicknames her ""Water Bird"" – in the original it is ""Africa""), and the different social groups aren't categorised by race. Damian sings the I, Carly theme song in French instead of Christina Aguilera's Beautiful at the Christmas talent show.

The ""obsessed lesbian"" rivalry between Janis and Regina (Reneé Rapp) remains, though it is more fleshed out (perhaps owing to the bisexuality of the two actors who play them), with Janis being openly queer and Regina playing that up to appeal to the male gaze (when a game of spin the bottle in middle school requires that the two kiss, which leads to their falling out). The difference this time around is that Janis won't be shamed for her sexuality, and her trauma is that she lost her best friend, who was bullied and kicked out of school.

Regina is still a terrifying bully, perhaps even more so than McAdams's version because Reneé Rapp is legitimately scary

The humanisation afforded to its characters also extends to Regina. In the original, Regina was a fairly stock standard, one-dimensional villain, however well-played by the sorely underrated Rachel McAdams. The musical addition of Regina's songs, Someone Gets Hurt and World Burn, grant us insight into her motivations outside of having ""money and looks"". Someone Gets Hurt lets us see that her pride and her ""cold and forbidding"" persona are a ""performance/This is all self-defence,"" while World Burn reinforces her barriers after she is the one who gets hurt: ""This is what I get for helping… I wanna watch the world burn/And everyone get mean.""

Some might say that the Mean Girls redux is ""too nice"", but if the bar is Y2K-era insults then the bar is in very low indeed. There are none of the fat-shaming, homophobic or racist slurs, but Regina is still a terrifying bully, perhaps even more so than McAdams's version because Reneé Rapp is legitimately scary. (Just ask Buddy the bus driver.) The Burn Book crucially still exists, and thankfully it remains in analogue (""from that week [the teachers] took away our phones"") instead of on social media or as a text chain. Some of the updated insults don't quite land though: ""fat virgin"" is now ""horny shrimp"" and ""fugly slut"" is now ""fugly cow"".

As Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, author of the new book So Fetch: The Making of Mean Girls (And Why We're Still So Obsessed With It), writes, ""Now 'space-dyke' become[s] 'space-lez'. You can debate among yourselves how much that helps."" But owing to the much-needed diversity of the cast and characters, Tina Fey recently told The New York Times that ""Regina wouldn't try [some of the stuff from the original] now because she knows the kids around her would be like, 'That's homophobic.' She would know not to be homophobic, and hopefully, truly would not be homophobic.""

Fey goes on to say that what was considered normal ""mean girl"" teen behaviour in 2004 has permeated the culture and politics today. Though one could argue the same about the societal climate surrounding the original, this might not be your mother's Mean Girls, but it's certainly updated for a new generation.","Has Mean Girls lost its bite?

Low-cost hacks to improve heating efficiency can help make some gains – but how effective are they? (Credit: Getty Images)

Heat can escape from buildings in a number of ways, but there are some evidence-based, low-cost things you can do to help stay warm.

Things came to a head last winter. Patsy Pope, a pensioner who lives alone in London, UK, could feel the cold air on her legs and back hampering her efforts to keep warm. The draughts were leaking in from around the windows in her council flat. Outside, temperatures fell to around 0C (32F) that December but the cost of heating had rocketed, due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Pope tried wrapping up as best she could but was still miserably cold. So she called her local authority. They were soon on site with draught blockers and foil backing for her six radiators, the idea being that these reflect heat back into the room rather than letting it escape through the external walls.

Help with staying warm Financial help is available in various forms for help with staying warm. In the US, various charities offer help for those facing energy hardship, including The Salvation Army. There is also the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The UK organisation Citizens Advice can offer assistance with bills for some people. Fuel Bank Foundation, a charity, also provides funding for people experiencing fuel poverty.

""It was just much warmer in here, you couldn't really feel the draught,"" says Pope. ""It's like the heat was being kept in.""

She's not sure how much the temperature indoors changed, exactly, but she can feel the difference. Her experience suggests that a few simple adjustments to the fabric of a building can boost the warmth inside, especially during cold snaps. Social media is awash with pithy videos outlining tips like these and many more.

However, there's relatively little scientific data about the efficacy of such measures, to help people choose one over another. Plus, some frequently mentioned ideas – such as heating a room with candles – could be dangerous. Ultimately, in colder climates, it is not advisable to try and do without a heating system in the winter, though you can improve said system's performance slightly.

Energy poverty is a growing problem in many nations, including the UK – where nearly 5,000 excess deaths caused by cold homes are estimated to have occurred last winter, according to the End Fuel Poverty Coalition. That is a rise of nearly 50% on the previous winter. In the US, the Energy Information Administration says that 27% of households reported energy insecurity – amounting to around 34 million homes.

Here's what you need to know about budget heating hacks, their potential to save you money – and also their limitations.

""It was a bit of a blank, there wasn't enough out there about some of these cheaper or free things,"" says Katy King, deputy director of sustainable future at Nesta, a UK innovation agency. Last year, Nesta published the estimated savings, in kilowatt hours, that people could achieve by doing things such as applying foil backing to radiators or adding secondary glazing film to their windows.

The figures, based on the expected change to a typical British household's energy consumption, suggest that reducing the flow temperature – the temperature of water sent to radiators – of a gas combi boiler to 60C (140F) would save £43 ($55) per year. This saving increases if you can turn the flow temperature down even further, says King. Secondary glazing film could also save around £40 ($51) in most homes. These figures reflect the cost of energy as it was in the UK in autumn 2023, although the US Department of Energy estimates that heat passing through windows accounts for about 25-30% of the energy used to heat and cool buildings.

Foil backing for radiators, however, won't save you as much, according to Nesta's research and this only works on externally insulated walls in homes with gas- or oil-based heating. However, reducing draughts can be very impactful.

Turning your thermostat down from 20C to 19C (68F to 66F) was estimated to save in excess of £100 ($127) and wrapping up warm instead of relying on your heating system too much can also cut costs over a year. Altogether, the research indicates that free and low cost measures can save several hundred pounds across a year, if combined.

There are plenty of other options too. Turn your radiator thermostatic valves down to between 2 and 3 to achieve roughly 18C (64F), the recommended minimum healthy indoor temperature, for example. And bleed water-filled radiators to remove a build-up of air inside them and improve their heat output when your boiler is running.

King mentions another additional measure not specifically highlighted in the research published by Nesta: reduced-flow shower heads. These will save money by reducing the amount of heating required for a shower and also the volume of water used, if you live in an area where water is metered. For those who do pay for water, this tactic could save around £70 ($89) annually.

It's also worth thinking about how long you spend in the shower, says Elliot Clark, fuel poverty advisor at the Centre for Sustainable Energy. Especially if you have an electric shower. At current average UK electricity prices, a 10-minute hot shower can cost around 50p (64 cents). That's not a huge amount on its own, but multiply it by three people and 365 days a year, for example, and it adds up to nearly £550 ($700). By sticking to a four-minute shower you can cut this cost by more than half, Clark says.

Jo Alsop at The Heating Hub, an independent advisory service, emphasises cracking down on draughts. She had an open fireplace in her own living room removed, to great results.

""It transformed my sitting room – it wasn't sucking all of the warm air out of the house,"" she says.

Clark suggests blocking up holes around pipes in external walls or other areas where the brickwork isn't as well-sealed as it should be. However, it's important not to block up ventilation bricks or extractor fan outlets.

Thick curtains, draught excluders under doors or in letterboxes can all help, too. Rose Chard, Fair Future Programme Lead at Energy Systems Catapult, a non-profit, says even a small increase in temperature can change lives: ""Just one or two degrees and you can see a reduction in respiratory problems or mental health issues. I don't think that should be underestimated.""

But it is problematic to rely on budget measures too heavily. Often, people use the phrase ""heat the person not the room"" to emphasise keeping one's body warm with thermal clothing and electric blankets, for instance, at a lower overall cost. The potential pitfall with this is, if your room gets very cold, then you will still be breathing in cold air, which is potentially harmful, explains Chard: ""There can be an impact on respiratory symptoms.""

Plus, cold walls and glazing are magnets for condensation and, therefore, mould. Black mould can be life-threatening and is difficult to eradicate once it establishes itself in a property.

""We want to put people in a situation where they can afford to use their heating,"" says Aimee Ambrose at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK. ""There shouldn't really be a substitute for heating.""

She adds that certain ideas that sometimes pop up in film and TV, or on social media, could be a fire risk, including using candles and terracotta pots to generate warmth, or turning on a cooking device and leaving it unattended.

In countries where the cost of housing, and energy, are high relative to people's incomes, the spectre of a cold home is more likely to affect a larger number of people. And that's when low-cost measures to improve your heating system's performance begin to become less viable.

Antoine Rassasse lives in shared rented accommodation in London. He is currently job-seeking. ""No one wants to be unemployed,"" he says. In the meantime, his benefits payments only cover his main bills each month meaning he must rely on the £500 ($640) overdraft his bank offers to get by. But his flat is cold. His bedroom has single-glazing and he and the other tenants can only afford to put the heating on for a few hours each day. To help, he keeps the blinds drawn and wears multiple layers of thermals and heavy clothing.

""It's like I am outdoors as opposed to feeling warm at home,"" he says. ""It's not a great feeling at all."" Both he and Pope visit a food bank run by the charity Dads House, which has been doing an ""absolutely brilliant job"", says Rassasse. ""If there were no food banks, I don't know what I would have done.""

He recalls watching a BBC TV programme last year that discussed various budget heating hacks but explains that he is wary of making too many changes to his rented accommodation. Plus, he has very little money to spend on things such as secondary glazing film. ""If I had the money, obviously I would invest more,"" he says.

So while these measures can help cut costs for people able to use their heating to a reasonable extent, there are still those for whom they will make little, if any difference.

And Chard helps to run Warm Home Prescription, a new service from Energy Systems Catapult and the NHS, which offers help including boiler services and payments for people in the UK to heat their homes adequately. Last winter, the service assisted more than 800 households, says Chard.

For Pope, who relies on her pension to cover her energy bills, the cost of heating remains daunting – an unfamiliar experience for her. When she was working, she never faced such difficulties. And while she is very grateful for the council's help, Pope says a bigger response is warranted. Heating is a human right, she argues.

""More should be done for those vulnerable people, pensioners. People with disabilities. Young children,"" she says. ""I think more should be done for them.""

Self-checkout technology has grown, but not every business and consumer is happy with the investment (Credit: Alamy)

Unstaffed tills were supposed to revolutionise shopping. Now, both retailers and customers are bagging many self-checkout kiosks.

It's a common sight at many retail stores: a queue of people, waiting to use a self-checkout kiosk, doing their best to remain patient as a lone store worker attends to multiple malfunctioning machines. The frustration mounts while a dozen darkened, roped-off and cashier-less tills sit in the background.

For shoppers, self-checkout was supposed to provide convenience and speed. Retailers hoped it would usher in a new age of cost savings. Their thinking: why pay six employees when you could pay one to oversee customers at self-service registers, as they do their own labour of scanning and bagging for free?

While self-checkout technology has its theoretical selling points for both consumers and businesses, it mostly isn't living up to expectations. Customers are still queueing. They need store employees to help clear kiosk errors or check their identifications for age-restricted items. Stores still need to have workers on-hand to help them, and to service the machines.

The technology is, in some cases, more trouble than it's worth.

""It hasn't delivered anything that it promises,"" says Christopher Andrews, associate professor and chair of sociology at Drew University, US, and author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy. ""Stores saw this as the next frontier… If they could get the consumer to think that [self-checkout] was a preferable way to shop, then they could cut labour costs. But they're finding that people need help doing it, or that they'll steal stuff. They ended up realising that they're not saving money, they're losing money.""

One of the frustrations of self-checkout can be the extra work of having to find a specific PLU code to ring up a purchase (Credit: Alamy)

Unexpected problems in the bagging area

Many retail companies have invested millions – if not billions – of dollars in self-checkout technology, which Andrews says was first developed during the 1980s, and started appearing in stores in the 1990s. They're not exactly cheap to get into stores: some experts estimate a four-kiosk system can run six figures.

Despite the cost to install them, many retailers are reversing course on the tech. Target, for instance, is restricting the number of items self-checkout customers can purchase at one time. Walmart has removed some self-checkout kiosks in certain stores to deter theft. In the UK, supermarket chain Booths has also cut down on the number of self-service kiosks in its stores, as customers say they're slow and unreliable.

Dollar General, one of the fastest-growing retailers in the US, is also re-thinking its strategy. In 2022, the discount chain leaned heavily into self-checkout technology – it's not uncommon to see only one or two employees staffing an entire Dollar General store in some areas. Despite the investment, they are now planning to increase the number of employees in stores ""and in particular, the checkout area"", according to the company's CEO, Todd Vasos.

""We had relied and started to rely too much this year on self-checkout in our stores,"" he said during the company's Q3 2023 earnings call on 7 December 2023. ""We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary."" (Dollar General did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment).

Some data shows retailers utilising self-checkout technology have loss rates more than twice the industry average

Some retailers cite theft as a motivator for ditching the unstaffed tills. Customers may be more willing to simply swipe merchandise when using a self-service kiosk than they are when face-to-face with a human cashier. Some data shows retailers utilising self-checkout technology have loss rates more than twice the industry average.

In addition to shrink concerns, experts say another failure of self-checkout technology is that, in many cases, it simply doesn't lead to the cost savings businesses hoped for. Just as Dollar General appears poised to add more employees to its check-out areas, presumably increasing staffing costs, other companies have done the same. Despite self-checkout kiosks becoming ubiquitous throughout the past decade or so, the US still has more than 3.3 million cashiers working around the nation, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Humans or machines?

Consumers want this technology to work, and welcomed it with open arms. However, years later, they're still queueing for tills; waiting for store-staff assistance with errors or age checks; and searching high and low for the PLU code of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions they're trying to purchase.

In a 2021 survey of 1,000 American shoppers, 60% of consumers said they prefer to use self-checkout over a staffed checkout aisle when given the choice, yet 67% of consumers have had the technology fail while trying to use it.

The bottom line is businesses want to cut costs, and shoppers want to get in and out of a store. If self-checkout isn't the answer, they'll find another avenue.

""It's not that self-checkout technology is good or bad, per se… [but] if we try self-checkout and realise we're not benefitting from it, we might switch back to not using it,"" says Amit Kumar, an assistant professor of marketing and psychology at the University of Texas, who studies consumer behaviour and decision-making.

That appears to be happening in many cases, as customers' frustrations with the technology persist. But Andrews says that while stores may change up their strategies – as seen with Dollar General and others – many large retail chains are likely to keep kiosks in stores due to sunk costs. ""They spent billions putting it in stores, and are hoping they can still get the public to buy into it,"" he says.

Retailers may continue to rely on the technology, but many aren't putting all their farm-fresh eggs in the self-checkout basket. Instead, they're increasingly giving customers the option to choose between human and machine.

For the customers that do choose to do the labour themselves, there's one thing Andrews believes won't change. However ubiquitous the technology is, and however much consumers get used to using the kiosks, shoppers are likely to find themselves disappointed and frustrated most of the time.","For shoppers, self-checkout was supposed to provide convenience and speed.

From rambling up the Saturn Steps to dipping into El Rio for a drink to eating your way through the Mission, local expert Laura Kiniry shares her only-in-SF picks.

Sure, the Golden Gate Bridge is iconic and climbing the hills in a cable car is practically a rite of passage, but San Francisco, California, has plenty of more obscure attractions that are typically overlooked. This is a city loaded with fascinating history, from its days as a booming Gold Rush centre to its role as an epicentre of gay rights. Its ""anything-goes"" attitude has long attracted dreamers, creatives and travellers.

It's also a city of neighbourhoods, where you might find yourself dining on bursting-at-the-seams burritos in the company of a mariachi band in the Mission District one hour, and across town trying your hand at origami in Japantown the next. Experiences like these embody the heart of San Francisco and offer real insight into the diversity, culture and people that make the city so special. They're not things easily found at tourist-heavy spots like Fisherman's Wharf or a walk around Union Square, but once you know where to look, you can start peeling back the layers that make San Francisco so utterly and undeniably one-of-a-kind.

From strolling through urban jungles in the midst of wild parrots to dancing away an afternoon on the back patio of an LGBTQ+ institution, here are seven only-in-SF must-do experiences.

1. Best for history: Presidio National Park

History exudes from nearly every inch of this 6.2-sq-km parkland that's perched at the southern foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Muwekma Ohlone people occupied the land that's now the Presidio for centuries before Spain established it as a military base in 1776 – one that Mexico, and later the US, took over. Congress closed the base in 1989 and by 1994 it became a part of the US National Park Service.

Today the Presidio is a natural and cultural playground for city residents, drawn by its windy roads that are ideal for cycling and hiking and meander among towering cypress, pine and eucalyptus trees. Former officers' quarters and army barracks have been transformed into boutique lodgings and museums highlighting the life of Walt Disney and Golden Gate Park during the Gilded Age. There's even a converted air hanger that houses an indoor trampoline park.

One of the Presidio's newest additions is its Presidio Tunnel Tops, a 14-acre oasis spread atop two highway tunnels that have replaced a stretch of road irreparably damaged by a 1989 earthquake. Along with a wind-sheltered campfire circle and huge play structures crafted from fallen trees and boulders, Tunnel Tops connects the bulk of the Presidio with its long-isolated Crissy Field, a former military runway that's now brimming with tidal marsh and spongy grasslands, along with unbeatable bayside views.

El Rio is something of a locals-only dive bar (Credit: Wikipedia)

2. Best for a tipple: El Rio

What began as a gay leather bar in the late 1970s is now one of San Francisco's most beloved neighbourhood institutions. A sign hanging out front lovingly refers to it as ""Your Dive"" (a slogan that was actually part of its original name), and the LQBTQ+ space in the city's Outer Mission District attracts everyone from straight couples to gay tech bros. Locals flock to El Rio for regular events like Salsa Sundays (every fourth Sunday) and Drag Bingo nights, while queer artist showcases and all-female rock shows are also par for the course.

The SpeciaList Journalist and San Francisco resident Laura Kiniry has lived in the heart of the city for nearly 30 years, and has been writing about her chosen home for more thana decade.

With its lemon and palm trees, strewn lights and a large wooden mural of actress and samba singer Carmen Miranda hanging as a backdrop, the bar's back patio is the place to be on warm nights. BYO food and settle at one of the scattering of tables for a meal, or partake in a seemingly endless dance party instead. The divey vibe indoors is perfect for sipping on mezcal margaritas and pints of draft-poured IPAs, or for playing a couple of games of shuffleboard.

El Rio considers itself a ""work in progress"" (for example, they're currently raising funds for more bathrooms), and its long-time fans are happily along for the ride.

3. Best for outdoor exercise: San Francisco staircases

San Francisco is a city of hills. Thankfully, this also means some incredible public staircases. The city literally has hundreds of them, many tucked away in residential neighbourhoods and hidden among overgrown urban jungles, accessible only on foot. Some are merely shortcuts, while others are lush green oases offering a quiet reprieve and resulting in some stellar skyline vistas.

Local residents especially love the Sunset neighbourhood's 16th Avenue Tiled stairway, a 163-step climb covered in a mosaic of sea and stars that leads to a small park filled with cypress trees and ancient rock formations.

Over in the Castro district, the Vulcan Steps stretch upwards for nearly two blocks, passing cosy-looking bungalows and terraced gardens, while a half-block away, the Saturn Steps happen to be the only staircase in the city deemed to be an actual San Francisco park. There are even some lovingly placed benches for resting.

Loud-mouthed red-masked parakeets make their home along the slopes of Telegraph Hill and the Filbert Steps stairway, where you'll find Napier Lane, a wooden walkway lined with mid-19th-Century cottages once belonging to longshoremen. For sprawling mansions, incredible vistas overlooking the Palace of Fine Arts – which rises like a Roman ruin from the city's Marina district – and a 332-step workout, the Lyon Street Steps are a must.

4. Best for a vintage trip: San Francisco street cars

Not to be mistaken for the city's iconic cable cars, San Francisco's colourfully painted vintage street cars have been rumbling along the city's central Market Street corridor since 1995 and along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf since 2000. These restored late 19th- to early 20th-Century streamlined beauties – many of them brought in from Philadelphia and then refurbished in historically accurate paint schemes, showing how they would have been originally painted in, say, Osaka or Melbourne – are a throwback to an era when electric street cars proliferated. Riding in one is almost like stepping back in time. Their history is on full display at the San Francisco Railway Museum & Gift Shop, where archival photography and rare motion picture footage provide a sense of what SF was like in its own streetcar heyday.

Getting around There's no reason to rent a car in San Francisco. Your two feet and public transport can get you almost everywhere. The city is compact and features easy-to-access bikeshare programmes, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Muni metro and cable car transportation systems. Plus, finding a parking spot in many neighbourhoods is more trouble than it's worth.

Unlike cable cars, which are pulled up San Francisco's steep hills by underground cables, the street cars making up SF's historic F line get their power from overhead wires. Trying to identify them by their colours and numbers is a game that San Franciscans love playing. For example, the No 1070 Newark, NJ is easily recognisable due to its bright-red wheels; while the vibrant yellow of the No 1057 Cincinnati, OH is an Instagram favourite. There's also the boxier ""Peter Witt"" streetcars, equipped with wooden-slat bench seats and exteriors sporting the green, orange, and yellow-and-white liveries of those that once operated (and some that still do) in Milan, Italy.

On warmer days and special occasions, the F line even rolls out two open-top ""boat trams"" from Blackpool, England. While the coloured lights strewn along their masts are a tribute to Blackpool's own autumn Illuminations tradition, their ""Jolly Roger"" flags are an ode to San Francisco's freewheeling spirit.

5. Best for sensory overload: Calle 24 Latino Cultural District

San Francisco's Outer Mission District has been a Latinx neighbourhood since the early 1940s, when it started attracting immigrants from Mexico, followed by Chileans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Puerto Ricans and other Central and South American countries. Today, the cultural melting pot that comprises San Francisco's larger Mission neighbourhood can often feel lost among its swanky bars and boutiques. But despite the area's ongoing gentrification, 24th Street between Mission Street and Potrero Avenue holds tight to its distinct heritage.

Walk it out Locally run Foodie Adventures hosts excellent 3.5-hour walking tours along 24th Street, focusing on many of the area's best authentic Latinx spots.

This is what's known as the Calle 24 Latino Cultural District, where hole-in-the-wall taquerias still serve up mouth-watering carnitas (shredded pork) tacos; prayer candles, piñatas and lucha libre wrestling masks stock the shelves; and bakeries whip up loaves of pan dulce and chocolate concha pastries daily.

Whether it's shopping for molcajetes (mortar and pestles) and handmade tortillas at the 70-plus-year-old La Palma Mexicatessen, catching a performance by Salvadoran American dancer/choreographer Jessica Recinos and her Rising Rhythm Dance Company at the renovated 1920s Brava Theater Center or simply strolling among the many political and thought-provoking murals along Balmy Alley, you'll find it here in the beating heart of San Francisco's Latinx heritage.

6. Best for culture: Japantown

Unlike San Francisco's Chinatown, with its stunning pagoda roofs, the city's Japantown isn't as architecturally eye-catching, but this understated neighbourhood offers a glimpse into a part of San Francisco's history that's often overlooked.

The oldest and largest Japanese community in the US, SF's Japantown originated after the city's devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, when displaced Japanese residents living in the South of Market area and on the outskirts of Chinatown began moving west. During World War Two, the US government forced Japanese Americans from their homes and into internment camps, leaving much of the neighbourhood vacant. Despite hardships, including a fight against urban renewal, Japantown prevailed.

Insider tips The non-profit San Francisco City Guides occasionally hosts free Japantown walking tours. The US' second-largest cherry blossom festival- also occurs here over two weekends each April.

Today, you can sit down to fresh noodles made onsite at Udon Mugizo; take beginner origami classes or shop for decorative papers in prints like tie-dye and Japanese garden at Paper Tree, and croon to your heart's content at Pagoda, where group sing-a-longs are the norm.

Other popular stops include Kabuki Springs & Spa, a neighbourhood landmark known for its shiatsu massage and soaking tubs, and Nijiya Market, where you can pick up a freshly made seafood bento box or sushi bowl to enjoy within the Japantown Peace Plaza – an outdoor space between the area's two Japan Center Malls, dominated by the five-tiered Peace Pagoda.

7. Best for an outdoor adventure: JFK Promenade

Although a portion of Golden Gate Park's main thoroughfare has been closed to vehicular traffic on Sundays and holidays for more than 50 years, JFK Promenade, a 1.5-mile stretch between Stanyan Street and Crossover Drive, became a haven for city residents during the pandemic, when the city kept it closed each day so cyclists, pedestrians, roller skaters and skateboarders could enjoy some fresh air. The move became permanent in 2022, when the street was reborn as JFK Promenade. It's now one of the best outdoor spaces to congregate in the city.

In September 2022, the city arts non-profit Illuminate simultaneously launched the Golden Mile Project, an ongoing transformation of the promenade into a gathering space of art and performance. SF non-profit Paint the Void led the installation of 12 colourful murals painted upon the road, which these days also features inventive artworks like a humpback whale ta il, a series of bronze Dogman and Rabbitwoman sculptures showcasing these more-than-8ft-tall anamorphic figures in scenes from everyday life, and small parklets brimming with playable pianos, ping pong tables and corn hole sets, and movable Adirondack chairs.

Listen to live music in an occasional pop-up beer garden near 14th Avenue, or climb onto giant letter blocks that spell out ""LOVE"" just east of the Conservatory of Flowers – a Victorian-style glass-and-wood greenhouse where exotic plants such as climbing oleander and Thai Pink Aeschynanthus thrive.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67993371,Manchester City charges: Premier League says date has been set for hearing,['Author not found'],"Manchester City were taken over by owners from Abu Dhabi in 2008

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters says a date has been set for the hearing into Manchester City's alleged breaches of financial rules.

But, speaking in front of MPs, Masters said he could not reveal the date.

Everton, already appealing against a 10-point deduction for a previous charge, and Nottingham Forest were charged for breaching league profit and sustainability rules on Monday.

Masters said he understood why both clubs' fans might be frustrated.

""I can [understand] but they are very different charge"" he told the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee.

""If any club, the current champions or otherwise, had been found in breach of the spending rules, they would be in exactly the same position as Everton or Nottingham Forest.

""But the volume and character of the charges laid before Manchester City, which I obviously cannot talk about at all, are being heard in a completely different environment.

""There is a date set for that proceeding. Unfortunately, I can't tell you when that is but it is progressing.""

Premier League champions City were charged with more than 100 breaches in February 2023 but are yet to face a hearing.

Everton were handed a 10-point deduction in November, having been referred to an independent commission in March.

City's charges related to a nine-year time frame from 2009. Since 2009, they have won the top flight seven times, but are facing potential relegation and having titles taken away if the case against them is proven.

They were also charged with failing to co-operate since the Premier League launched its investigation in 2018.

There have been reports the case will be heard at the end of this year, although this has not been confirmed by the Premier League and it seems unlikely there will be a verdict until 2025.

'We will defend ourselves against Premier League charges' - Guardiola

'We have a duty to the other 19 clubs'

Everton and Nottingham Forest's referral to an Independent Commission is for alleged breaches during the three-year period ending 2022-23.

These cases must be heard by 8 April.

Before that, there will be a hearing for Everton's appeal against the first alleged breach which relates to the previous year.

Masters was asked if this was merely an attempt by the Premier League to prove it can operate without a football regulator, something that the government plans to appoint.

""No. We take our rule book very seriously,"" he responded.

""It is a handshake between all 20 clubs. Clubs look each other in the eye and say we will comply with these rules. They expect the board, if clubs don't comply with those rules, to take action.

""Everton are a very important member of the Premier League, an ever present. But we also have to think about the other 19 clubs and their fanbases in the decisions that we make.

""The charges we made in March 2023, for the first Everton case, were eventually heard in October. We did make a plea at the time to hear the first case before the end of the season but Everton argued against that and the commission agreed with them.

""Nobody likes enforcing these financial rules. They were brought in in 2013-14 with the specific purpose of ensuring that unsustainable spending couldn't go too far and a wrapper was put around how much clubs could invest in pursuit of their aims. It is the first time we have laid a charge in this way.""

MP fears Reading owner is trying to 'fold' club

Football League chair Rick Parry sat alongside Masters in front of the panel.

One MP, Damian Green, is a Reading fan and was at Saturday's game against Port Vale which was abandoned after fans invaded the pitch to protest against owner Dai Yongge.

Green outlined the doomsday scenario many supporters are scared of becoming reality.

""The word on the street is that he now doesn't want to sell and is just asset stripping and is doing it quite visibly with players,"" Green said.

""He is willing to sell any player of any value for what little he can get and wants to be left with the training ground as a piece of property having folded the club.

""He was approved to be an owner and is someone who in two different countries has killed off two football clubs already. It seems to me pretty extraordinary that he was ever allowed into the English game in those circumstances.""

Parry said the EFL would be meeting Reading fans on Tuesday but outlined the complexity of the situation.

""We share the fans' concerns absolutely,"" he said.

""We are trying to take action against Dai Yongge. Just before Christmas, we took action against the owner in an attempt to get the owner disqualified.

""It failed on that occasion. They fined him instead which, frankly, is no use at all. If he won't put money into the club he won't pay the fines.

""Reading sold the stadium and training ground. It is absurd that was allowed to happen. Fortunately, that loophole has been closed.

""What normally happens in this situation is that clubs go into administration. At least then there is a process. It happened with Derby and Wigan.

""It is pretty extraordinary for an owner to effectively sit there and do nothing. That is a new one. We haven't seen that before. It is a fresh challenge and we don't have an instant solution.""

FA Cup replays and two-legged EFL Cup semis won't just be scrapped.

Parry said issues around the domestic calendar needed addressing as a matter or urgency.

BBC Sport has previously reported FA Cup replays from round three onwards and two-legged EFL Cup semi-finals will be ditched to create space for more European matches.

However, Parry said that with no deal yet on an increased funding package with the Premier League, who want to impose regulation around what Championship clubs can spend and are yet to agree where the proposed funding of around £900m will come from, the changes won't happen.

""As part of the total system, part of a new deal, we are prepared to take on board considerably less revenue to our clubs from the loss of FA Cup replays and from the second leg of the Carabao [Cup].

""We are absolutely not prepared to concede those on the basis that there is no deal. The 14 clubs who are the non-permanent members of the Premier League have been in there for an average of 13 years each.

""The 14 clubs in the EFL who had the longest tenure in the Premier League also had an average of 13 years in the Premier League. This season those 14 clubs in the Premier League will receive £1.8bn between them, the 14 in EFL will receive less than £90m, that is less than five percent.

""That is the chasm we are trying to bridge.""

No Saturday 3pm slot for WSL

As part of the calendar solutions, it has been suggested Women's Super League games could be televised at 15:00 GMT on a Saturday, which remains a blackout period.

This, it is argued, will create space for the women's game to showcase itself.

Masters said the change was unlikely to be practical because of the legalities around Uefa's 'Article 48', which allows the blackout to be in force.

""You can't divide Article 48 for different bits of the game,"" he said. ""If Article 48 didn't exist, everything could be televised. It is very difficult to find a slot where no men's football exists. The answer is not obvious.""","Premier League champions City were charged with more than 100 breaches in February 2023 but are yet to face a hearing.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67990821,Jose Mourinho: Roma sack former Manchester United and Chelsea boss and appoint Daniele de Rossi,['Author not found'],"Jose Mourinho took over at Roma following his departure from Tottenham

Jose Mourinho has been sacked as Roma manager and replaced by the club's former captain Daniele de Rossi.

Mourinho, 60, took over in May 2021 and led Roma to the Europa Conference League title a year later and the Europa League final in 2023.

But they are ninth in Serie A, five points off the Champions League places, and last week were knocked out of the Coppa Italia by city rivals Lazio.

Former midfielder De Rossi will replace Mourinho until the end of the season.

The club legend, 40, came through Roma's academy and played 616 times for the first team between 2001 and 2019.

De Rossi retired in 2020 and has since had one spell as manager - a 17-game tenure at Serie B club SPAL which ended with the Italian's sacking last February.

""We believe that the leadership and ambition that have always characterised him can be decisive in chasing the objectives that the team has ahead of it until end of the season,"" said Roma's owners Dan and Ryan Friedkin.

""We knew the indissoluble bond that unites Daniele to the club, but the enthusiasm with which he immediately accepted this challenge... further convinced us of his ability to be a guide for the players and a proud representative of the values ​​of this club.""

Daniele de Rossi has made the second-most appearances for Roma

De Rossi, who played 117 times for Italy and won the World Cup in 2006, said: ""The emotion of being able to sit on our bench is indescribable, everyone knows what Roma is for me, but the work that awaits all of us has already taken over.

""We have no time, no choice. Being competitive, fighting for our goals and trying to achieve them are the only priorities that my staff and I have given ourselves.""

De Rossi's appointment came just four hours after the sacking of Mourinho, when the Friedkins thanked the Portuguese ""for the passion and commitment he has shown"" as manager.

""We will always have great memories of his stewardship, but we believe that, in the best interests of the club, immediate change is necessary,"" they added in a statement.

Mourinho received a second successive red card in the Lazio loss and afterwards compared himself to Harry Potter, suggesting his profile was ""raising expectations"" for what Roma could achieve.

That result was followed by a 3-1 league defeat by AC Milan on Sunday, which left Roma five points adrift of fourth-placed Fiorentina and led to his dismissal.

Victory in the 2022 Conference League secured Roma's first major European title and earned Mourinho huge support among the club's fanbase.

But after they were beaten on penalties by Sevilla in last season's Europa League final Roma made a poor start to the current campaign, taking just five points from their first six Serie A matches.

With Roma 16th in the table, the former Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Tottenham boss said he had rejected the ""craziest offer"" to leave last summer.

Lionel Messi (front row) helped Inter Miami beat Nashville SC to win the Leagues Cup in the United States

Argentina forward Lionel Messi has won men's player of the year at the Fifa Best Awards, with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola claiming the men's coach prize in London.

Inter Miami's Messi edged out City striker Erling Haaland with Paris St-Germain attacker Kylian Mbappe third.

City's Ederson collected the goalkeeper award ahead of Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois and Al Hilal's Yassine Bounou.

City won the Treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in 2022-23.

Messi wins by tightest margin

Messi, 36, began 2023 at Paris St-Germain, before moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami in June.

He picked up the best men's player award for the third time since this format of the awards began in 2016, after doing so in 2019 and 2022.

He scored nine goals for PSG as they won the French Ligue 1 title and 10 goals in seven games as Inter Miami won the inaugural Leagues Cup in the United States.

Haaland grabbed a record 36 Premier League goals last season. In all competitions in 2022-23, he scored a club-record 52 goals - with 28 of them coming after the World Cup, plus another two goals this season before 20 August.

France's Mbappe, like Messi, won the Ligue 1 title with PSG - and clinched a fifth consecutive Golden Boot.

The 25-year-old netted 18 goals for his French club during the window of 19 December 2022 to 20 August 2023 - the period the awards were based on.

A mix of votes from national team managers and captains, journalists and fans on Fifa's website - with each counting for 25% - were used to decide the winners.

Messi and Haaland finished on the same amount of points, with Messi getting the award as he had more first-place nominations from national team captains.

Among the national team captains who voted for Messi were Harry Kane, Mbappe, Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson, Aaron Ramsey and Luka Modric, while Ilkay Gundogan and Casemiro voted for Haaland, as did Messi himself.

England boss Gareth Southgate gave his vote to Haaland, while Wales' Robert Page and Scotland's Steve Clarke voted for Messi.

Montserrat skipper Lyle Taylor opted for Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice, Russia skipper Georgi Dzhikiya voted for Georgia and Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Portugal boss Roberto Martinez voted for ex-Inter Milan midfielder Marcelo Brozovic, now at Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia.

Manchester City beat Inter Milan 1-0 in the 2023 Champions League final

The Fifa Best Awards generally cover a calendar year and are different to the Ballon d'Or awards, which reflect performances across a season and which Messi has won on eight occasions.

However, this year, the men's Fifa Best Awards, and Puskas Award, were judged from 19 December, 2022 to 20 August 2023, because the Qatar World Cup was included in last year's ceremony.

This year's event took place at the Hammersmith Apollo in London with a host of the best players past and present in attendance.

Six Manchester City players in team of the year

Men's coach of the year was the first award of the night, with Guardiola winning it ahead of Luciano Spalletti and Simone Inzaghi.

Spalletti guided Napoli to their first Serie A title in 33 years with a record-equalling five games to spare.

Inzaghi was nominated after winning the Coppa Italia with Inter Milan and taking them to the Champions League final, where they lost 1-0 to Manchester City.

Manchester City celebrate historic Treble in pouring rain

There were six Manchester City players named in the men's team of the year - defenders John Stones, Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias, midfielders Bernardo Silva and Kevin de Bruyne and striker Haaland.

Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham was also selected and was the only English player named in the side that does not play for City.

Men's team of the year: Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid), John Stones, Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva (all Manchester City), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Kevin de Bruyne and Erling Haaland (both Manchester City), Kylian Mbappe (Paris St-Germain), Lionel Messi (Inter Miami) and Vinicius Jr (Real Madrid).

Dias paid tribute to Guardiola and said: ""He is intense. In the end he makes you play football in a way that no-one else is able to and somehow through that intensity he does get the best out of everyone.

""You can have different personalities as coach but the one you want is the one that gets the best out of you.""

Guardiola added: ""Thank you so much to our players for what they have done for eight years together. Thank you so much for this incredible journey.""

Brighton's Enciso misses out on Puskas Award

Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso was one of three nominations for the Puskas Award, handed out to the player that had scored the best goal.

The award - named after Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas - was decided by pundits.

Enciso scored a spectacular long-range strike in the Seagulls' 1-1 draw at home against Manchester City on 23 May, but missed out on the award, which went to Brazilian Guilherme Madruga, who plays for second-tier Brazil side Botafogo after a spectacular 25-yard overhead kick.

'Haaland has been robbed there' - what you said

Hannah: How? I'd take Haaland over Messi right now any day.

GK: Not a City fan by any means but Haaland has been robbed there. How can you give an award to someone scoring goals in the MLS over someone scoring goals against the best players in the world to win the treble?

Andy: The awards had gone so well and have now lost all credibility. The continued obsession with Messi has now become embarrassing. Haaland's season will probably never be beaten.

On the other hand...

Ryan: Like he does on the pitch, Messi has come out of nowhere. The best sportsman of all time.

Green, 33, was banned last month after striking an opponent in the face and has missed the Warriors' past 16 games.

Green finished with seven points, seven rebounds and four assists in 24 minutes as the Warriors were beaten 116-107.

The forward was banned indefinitely for striking Phoenix Suns player Jusuf Nurkic in December - the third time Green had been ejected this season.

But his suspension was lifted earlier this month with the NBA saying Green had ""completed steps that demonstrated his commitment to conforming his conduct to standards expected"" although he still missed four more matches.

""Draymond played well, played hard. It's good to have him back,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.

The 20-year-old Spaniard, who at his past four Grand Slams has won two titles and reached two semi-finals, is aiming to significantly improve his record in Melbourne - where he has not gone beyond the third round in two previous appearances.

Alcaraz remained patient when faced with stern resistance from the 37-year-old Gasquet - playing the 23rd season of his career - who saved nine break points to force a tie-break in an entertaining opening set.

But, after edging the tie-break from 5-4 down, Alcaraz's quality shone through - although Gasquet forced him to wait until his fifth match point to finally clinch a victory which set up a second-round meeting with Italian Lorenzo Sonego, who beat Briton Dan Evans.

Elsewhere, Danish eighth seed Rune beat Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 in what he called a ""physical battle"".

German sixth seed Zverev, meanwhile, had to come from behind to beat compatriot Dominik Koepfer 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.

The win came the day after German court officials set a date for his trial over domestic abuse allegations, which he denies.

Bulgarian 13th seed Grigor Dimitrov - fresh from winning his first ATP title since 2017 in Brisbane - also advanced, coming back to beat Marton Fucsovics 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-2.

Meanwhile, 26-year-old Nagal will get the chance to further improve his bank balance - reaching the third round brings prize money of £133,000 - when he takes on Chinese world number 140 Shang Juncheng, who is ranked three places below him.

He said he was not thinking about expectations back home, saying: ""I want to go through this moment, take my time, enjoy being with my coach, have conversation, maybe eat a burger or something, and call it a night.""","Forced to miss last year's Australian Open because of injury, Wimbledon champion Alcaraz dominated French veteran Gasquet on his return to Melbourne Park in a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 6-2 win.
