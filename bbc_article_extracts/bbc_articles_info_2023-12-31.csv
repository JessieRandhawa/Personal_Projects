Russia has been striking Kharkiv in recent days

Ukraine is again under attack by Russian drones, officials say, after two days of major aerial assaults by both sides.

There are reports of explosions in Kyiv and Kharkiv, where the mayor said residential buildings were on fire.

Moscow has been retaliating against Ukrainian strikes on the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday, which killed at least 20 people.

That came after Russia carried out strikes across Ukraine on Friday.

Those strikes, which killed 39 people, were described by Kyiv as Russia's biggest missile bombardment of the war so far.

The latest attacks happened as Ukraine entered its final day of 2023.

Ukraine's air defence systems in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv were engaged late on Saturday to repel a Russian drone attack, the military administration of the region said on Telegram.

Drone attacks have been reported in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.

""These are not military facilities, but cafes, residential buildings and offices,"" he said.

""On the eve of the New Year, the Russians want to intimidate our city, but we are not scared - we are unbreakable and invincible.""

The extent of the damage is not clear and no casualties have been reported yet.

Earlier on Saturday, Russian strikes injured 19 in Kharkiv, the local government reported.

The latest attacks come after a deadly couple of days in Ukraine and Russia.

Russia's massive bombardment of Ukraine on Friday killed 39 people and injured nearly 160, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Several cities were hit, including the capital, Kyiv.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitchsko, said at least 16 people were killed in the city - making Friday the deadliest day so far for civilians in the capital.

This was followed by Ukrainian attacks on Russia.

Moscow accused Ukraine of deadly air strikes on the south-west of the country - with 20 people killed and more than 100 injured in Belgorod, near the border.

The regional governor said three children were among the dead in what was one of the deadliest attacks on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian security source said more than 70 drones had been launched against Russian targets, as a ""response to Russia's terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians"".

Addressing the situation in Belgorod, they blamed the ""incompetent work of Russian air defence"" for civilian casualties - saying this was what caused falling fragments.

Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of being behind drone strikes in recent months. Kyiv rarely admits to such attacks across the border, although it has carried out strikes like this before.","Ukraine war: Russia launches fresh drone assault on Kyiv and Kharkiv, officials sayBy George Wright BBC NewsEPARussia has been striking Kharkiv in recent daysUkraine is again under attack by Russian drones, officials say, after two days of major aerial assaults by both sides.

By Rajini Vaidyanathan Reporting from Bangladesh

BBC

Mamun lost 16 of his relatives after they were struck by lightning on the day of his wedding

On the day he thought he'd be celebrating his wedding, Mamun buried 16 of his relatives.

They had been killed by lightning on the way to the ceremony.

Dressed in their finest saris and suits, his family members boarded a boat to join Mamun, when a heavy storm struck. As the rain lashed down the boat pulled over and they took shelter under a tin shed on the riverbank, when they were hit.

Bangladesh, which is blighted by extreme weather and heavy storms, suffers an average of 300 deaths by lightning every year, according to the UN.

That's compared with fewer than 20 annually in the United States, which has almost double the population.

It's a heavy burden for the South Asian nation, and for many like Mamun, who is speaking for the first time about what happened on that day in August 2021.

The 21-year-old was getting ready at his in-laws' home in the Shibganj area in the country's north-west, when he heard the crackle of thunder, minutes before he got the gut-wrenching news.

He rushed to his family, where he was confronted with a scene of chaos and confusion.

""Some people were hugging the bodies,"" Mamun recalls, ""the injured were crying out in pain… children were screaming. I was at a loss. I could not even decide who I should go to first.""

Mamun

The funerals took place on the evening of Mamun's wedding

Mamun lost his father, grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts. His mother wasn't on the boat and survived the lightning attack.

""When I found my father's dead body I simply burst into tears. I was so shocked I fell sick,"" Mamun says.

Later that evening, the funerals of his relatives took place - the wedding feast they were meant to enjoy was instead distributed to the homeless.

Mamun later got married, but says he doesn't celebrate his wedding anniversary as it triggers painful memories. ""After the tragic incident, now I am really scared of rain and thunder.""

Lightning is a big killer in Bangladesh, claiming more lives annually than floods.

Salman Saeed

Reported deaths and injuries due to lightning have increased greatly in Bangladesh

The number of reported deaths due to lightning has also risen steeply, from just dozens per year in the 1990s.

Nasa, the UN and the government of Bangladesh cite increased storminess due to climate change as a reason for the increase in deadly strikes.

""Global warming, environmental changes, living patterns are all factors for the increasing death toll due to lightning,"" Md Mijanur Rahman, the director general of Bangladesh's disaster management division, told the BBC.

Such is the seriousness, that the government has added lightning strikes to the official list of natural disasters the country faces which includes floods, cyclones, earthquakes and droughts.

The majority of victims of lightning are farmers, who are vulnerable to the elements as they work the fields through the rainy monsoon months in the spring and summer.

Salman Saeed

Abdullah was wearing his Barcelona shirt when he was struck by lightning

A football shirt, hanging on a rickety fence, overlooking a field in the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is a poignant reminder of one of the victims.

Just days earlier, the shirt had been worn by Abdullah as he went into the vast rice fields to do his day's work.

Now, draped over the wooden barrier, the Barcelona football shirt is singed and frayed, the burnt edges of thread show where the lightning left its mark in May this year.

Abdullah's wife of three decades, Rehana, took me to the field to tell me what happened the day she lost her husband.

It was bright and sunny as Abdullah and a group of farmers went to harvest rice. By late afternoon a heavy storm began, and a lightning bolt struck her husband.

""Some of the other farmers brought him to this roadside shop,"" Rehana says, pointing to a small shack along the lane. ""By then he was already dead.""

Salman Saeed

Back at Rehana's house, the rice Abdullah harvested a day earlier lies in fresh piles outside the small one-room dwelling.

The couple had recently taken out a loan to build a second room to extend their modest home.

Inside, the couple's 14-year-old son Masood is reading a book. With no primary earner, Rehana fears she will be left with a lifetime of debt and wonders how she will pay for his studies.

""The fear gripped me so deeply that now if I see a cloud in the sky, I don't even dare to let my son go outside any more,"" she says consumed by tears.

Salman Saeed

Rehana says she doesn't let her son outside following the death of her husband

Lightning is a growing concern in other countries too - including neighbouring India which has also seen a rise in the number of strikes in recent years, but a significant reduction in the number of fatalities due to a number of initiatives.

There are efforts in Bangladesh to do more to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning.

Activists say more tall trees need to be planted in remote rural areas to absorb the impact of the strikes, especially in places which have borne the brunt of deforestation.

They also call for a large-scale programme to build lightning sheds, so farmers can take safe shelter, and for broader early warning systems to alert people about possible storms.

One challenge is the poor connectivity and lack of mobile usage in the areas where people are the most vulnerable.

A lack of awareness is also a challenge. Many in the country don't realise how dangerous lightning can be - few people anywhere in the world expect to be hit by a thunderbolt.

Farmer Ripon Hossen - who was with Abdullah the day he was killed - never imagined what lightning would look like up close, until it struck.

Salman Saeed

Farmer Ripon Hossen says he is terrified to work in the open but needs the income from farming

""There was a big loud sound, and then I saw lots of flashing lights,"" he recalled. ""It was as if a disk of fire had fallen on us. I felt a great electric shock and fell to the ground.

""After a while, I opened my eyes and saw that Abdullah was dead.""

Ripon can't believe he survived. He says he's terrified to work in the open, but in this impoverished agricultural area farming is the only source of income for him.

""I cry whenever I think of my friend Abdullah,"" he says.

""When I close my eyes at night, all the memories of that day return like a flashback. I can't console myself.""","Bangladesh sees dramatic rise in lightning deaths linked to climate changeBy Rajini Vaidyanathan Reporting from BangladeshBBCMamun lost 16 of his relatives after they were struck by lightning on the day of his weddingOn the day he thought he'd be celebrating his wedding, Mamun buried 16 of his relatives.

By Max Matza BBC News

Surfers raced to California's famous Mavericks Beach surf spot to ride the huge waves

The world's best big wave surfers are descending on California to catch the biggest storm swells the US West Coast has seen in years.

Surfers from Brazil, France and Portugal have arrived at Mavericks, a famous wave south of San Francisco, to ride the giant walls of water.

Waves up to 70ft (21 meters) have been ridden, as even larger waves pass by.

Officials have warned onlookers to stay away from the shore after people were injured by huge rogue waves.

Chris Cuvelier, who runs the Maverick Surf Awards competition and can see the rolling swells from his kitchen, told BBC News on Friday that ""people have been getting on flights all over the world"" to surf the legendary spot this week.

Professional surfers, ""especially people that surf Mavericks, they're big wave surfers and many of them are travelling around the globe to go catch big waves"", he says.

Famous pros like Kai Lenny, Andrew Cotton, and Lucas Chumbo have all appeared at Mavericks recently - some of them vying to win the prize money on offer from the Maverick Awards.

Filming the ride of their lives in this swell means they can enter into the digital competition for a chance at the as-yet unannounced 2024 prize pool.

JoJo Roper, a San Diego-based pro surfer, loaded up his car after Christmas once he saw the ""gigantic"" swell in the forecast.

It was the biggest since at least 2007, he says, telling BBC News ""it's been a long time since it's been that kind of a day"".

Mr Roper, 33, said he was one of the only Californian surfers out there on Thursday, riding the 60-70ft waves.

His friend flew from Hawaii to tow him into the waves on a jet ski.

""It's nice to have it in our territory, and take advantage of some waves close to home rather than travelling to Portugal or where all these other guys come from to chase their waves,"" he told BBC News.

""They're coming to chase our waves. It's pretty cool. It all comes full circle.""

Speaking on Friday, he called Thursday ""one of the best days in my lifetime for sure"".

Eight people were injured as a rogue wave swamped people and vehicles in the city of Ventura

On his third wave of the day, he fired into the barrel of a massive collapsing wall of water.

""It was an honour. And just to get barrelled is a whole other realm of victory,"" he says with a triumphant laugh.

""So I'm pretty happy about it.""

""Powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures.""

The NWS said there is ""an increased risk for ocean drowning"" due to rip currents.

More swells are in the forecast for Mavericks, located near the city of Half Moon Bay.

Police in Utah believe Kai Zhuang, 17, has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom

Police in the US are searching for a teenage Chinese exchange student they fear has been kidnapped.

Kai Zhuang, 17, was last seen on Wednesday at his home in the town of Riverdale in Utah.

Police said it is possible he is being held against his will and is in danger.

Officers were alerted to concerns about Kai's welfare on Thursday evening by the school he was attending in Riverdale, which had been contacted by his parents at home in China.

Riverdale Police Department Chief Casey Warren said the parents told school officials they had been sent a ransom demand and a picture of their son, indicating he was abducted.

Officers then visited the home of the host family where the missing teenager was living, who said they were unaware he was not in the house at the time.

The family told police they had seen Kai on the evening of 27 December and may have heard him in the early hours of the following morning.

Investigators initially said they believed the boy had been ""forcefully taken from his home"".

But on Friday, Mr Warren told reporters there was currently no evidence to suggest that.

He said officers are working with the FBI in the US and authorities in China and that ""several investigative efforts are underway"" to find him.","Kai Zhuang: Police in Utah fear Chinese exchange student was kidnappedRiverside Police DepartmentPolice in Utah believe Kai Zhuang, 17, has been kidnapped and is being held for ransomPolice in the US are searching for a teenage Chinese exchange student they fear has been kidnapped.

UN peacekeepers are finishing their withdrawal from Mali on Sunday, after a long-running mission lasting a decade.

Minusma - the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission - began in 2013 after an armed rebellion, but has been asked to leave by the country's ruling military government.

The UN mission's head said it did a lot but fell below expectations.

With some 310 peacekeepers killed, Minusma was the UN's second deadliest mission worldwide, after Lebanon.

In the summer, Mali told the UN that its 12,000 peacemakers needed to leave, and the UN Security Council voted to withdraw the mission

UN staff have been leaving in stages for months, with a deadline of 31 December for full withdrawal.

On Friday, local media reported that Minusma had handed over control of one of its last major camps in the northern Timbuktu region ahead of the deadline, for security reasons.

Timbuktu was one of three sites which were supposed to remain open to manage the end of the mission after 31 December, but the UN was worried about the presence of militants, reports said.

El-Ghassim Wane, head of the UN mission, said in a recorded statement that there was a ""gap between what we were mandated to do and we were able to do"".

""We did a lot but definitely it was below expectations and below the needs,"" he added.

Security in Mali is fragile, with armed Islamist and independence movements active.

Mali's government is also building closer ties to Russia - including by relying on the Wagner mercenary group - just as Western influence declines.

The mission began 10 years ago, after separatist rebels and Islamist fighters banded together and occupied northern Mali in an effort to create a separate state.

France sent troops to try and put down the uprising, followed by UN peacekeepers.

The threat from Islamist militants, who have killed several thousand people and forced tens of thousands from their homes, continued over the years.

And despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and French troops, who led counter-terror operations, the number of terror attacks in Mali steadily increased, as did the number of Malians joining insurgent groups. France announced it was withdrawing troops last year.

Mali has been run by military leaders following two coups in 2020 and 2021.

The country has been struggling with a widespread jihadist insurgency that has made much of the north and east ungovernable.

In recent years, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara had made major gains, occupying large swathes of territory in southeast Mali.

Many central regions have also recently been experiencing a surge in violence perpetrated by militants linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State groups.","Mali: UN peacekeeping mission ends after decadeBy Daniel De Simone BBC NewsReutersUN troops pictured in Kidal, northern Mali, in May this yearUN peacekeepers are finishing their withdrawal from Mali on Sunday, after a long-running mission lasting a decade.

Vinesh Phogat, seen here being detained by police in May, is a World Championship medallist

A top wrestler in India has returned two of her medals to highlight alleged sexual harassment of female athletes.

Vinesh Phogat, one of India's most decorated women wrestlers, left the prestigious awards on a roadside kerb after she was refused permission to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She and several wrestlers accuse former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Singh of sexually harassing women wrestlers for years.

Mr Singh denies the allegations.

Ms Phogat announced this week that that she was returning the Khel Ratna award, the country's highest sporting honour which she received in 2020, along with her Arjuna Award - both which are given by the government.

She had planned to deliver her awards to Mr Modi but was blocked by police.

Ms Phogat left her awards on a pavement in Delhi on Saturday. She said such honours had become meaningless at a time when wrestlers are struggling to get justice.

Protests by the wrestlers first began in January.

Ms Phogat - a two-time World Championship medallist - alleged that at least 10 women wrestlers had told her they had been sexually exploited by Mr Singh, who is an influential lawmaker and politician from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spoke on Sunday as the five-day annual meeting came to an end

North Korea plans to launch three more spy satellites next year as part of efforts to ramp up its military, the country's state media has said.

Last month Pyongyang put a spy satellite into space - and claims it has since photographed major US and South Korean military sites.

Setting out his aims for 2024, Kim Jong Un also said his dealings with South Korea would see ""fundamental change"".

And he said he had no option but to press ahead with his nuclear ambitions.

Speaking at an end-of-year meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, Mr Kim said unification with South Korea was now no longer possible. He said Seoul treats his country as an enemy.

It appears to be the first time Mr Kim has said such a thing and marks an official change in policy - although in practice there has been little prospect of unification for some years, with no progress and little effort being made.

Relations between the two countries are in a poor state. Last month, following the spy satellite launch, Pyongyang ripped up a deal with the Seoul that was aimed at lowering military tensions.

North Korea also continued regular tests of its missiles throughout 2023 - and earlier this month fired its most advanced long-range missile, defying UN curbs.

The launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile - which has the range to reach the North American continent - drew immediate condemnation from the West.

Meanwhile North Korea is unhappy over South Korea ramping up defence cooperation with the US, after a US submarine armed with nuclear weapons arrived in its waters.

Speaking on Sunday, Mr Kim hit out at the US, saying, according to state media: ""Because of reckless moves by the enemies to invade us, it is a fait accompli that a war can break out at any time on the Korean peninsula.""

He said South Korea had been transformed into a ""forward military base and nuclear arsenal"" of the US, and added: ""If we look closely at the confrontational military actions by the enemy forces... the word 'war' has become a realistic reality and not an abstract concept.""

Mr Kim said 2024 would see more military development, including strengthening nuclear and missile forces and building drones.","Setting out his aims for 2024, Kim Jong Un also said his dealings with South Korea would see ""fundamental change"".

Watch: A look back at some of Tom Wilkinson's memorable performances

British actor Tom Wilkinson, known for films like The Full Monty, Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has died aged 75.

Wilkinson won a Bafta for 1997's The Full Monty, and reprised the role of Gerald when a Disney+ streaming series revisited the characters 26 years on.

He received six Bafta nominations in total as well as two Oscar nominations, for Michael Clayton and In The Bedroom.

He died suddenly at home with his wife and family, they said in a statement.

George Clooney, who starred with Wilkinson in the 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, praised the actor as ""the epitome of elegance"".

Paying tribute, he told Variety magazine: ""Tom made every project better. Made every actor better.

""He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.""

With more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.

He also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.

His death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.

Wilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, ""a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain"".

Robert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as ""a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.""

In a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him ""powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best"", while singer and actor Will Young described him as ""British acting royalty"".

US film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was ""an amazing talent"" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

Tom Wilkinson (right) played Gerald in The Full Monty

Born in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.

""For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,"" he said.

""I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.""

He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.

Playing alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.

When he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: ""I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.""

Three years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.

""I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,"" he told The Guardian.

Wilkinson received high critical acclaim for Todd Field's 2001 US domestic drama In the Bedroom, in which he played a bereaved father. He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor.

He hoped the film would do two things for him, he later said. ""One, [prove] I could play the lead role in a movie. Two, I could play an American lead role. And it did both of those things.""

The actor earned his second Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Tony Gilroy's 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney.

Reuters

Many displaced Gazans are living ""in the open, in the parks,"" Juliette Touma of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has told the BBC.

According to the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), at least 100,000 people have fled to Rafah - which borders Egypt in Gaza's south - in recent days.

UNRWA's Ms Touma said the UN was being authorised to bring in ""limited assistance"".

But Gaza's humanitarian needs, she said, ""have massively grown"".

She said UNRWA continued to face ""restrictions to access areas in the Gaza Strip where we should access"".

Israel has said it is not limiting aid and the problem is with its distribution.

It launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas's deadly 7 October attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and a further 240 taken hostage.

More than 21,672 people have been killed in Gaza since that date, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says a further 56,165 Palestinians have been injured.

Access to humanitarian aid in the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave has been tightly controlled since the start of the war.

At the start of its military campaign, Israeli forces focused on Gaza's north. But more recently, they have been pounding Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which they see as a stronghold for Hamas.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a TV address on Saturday evening that Israel was ""fighting on all fronts"".

He echoed remarks by the chief of general staff, saying the war would go on ""for many months"", until Israel achieved ""the release of all our hostages and the dismantlement of Hamas"".

Speaking from Rafah, UNRWA's Gaza director Tom White told the BBC there were ""well over a million people"" seeking safety in the city.

Mr White said that for ""hundreds of thousands of people"" seeking safety in Rafah, ""there are no spots left"" in shelters - which included UNRWA schools and other municipal facilities.

He echoed comments made by Ms Touma, explaining that ""hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are now sleeping in the open under flimsy pieces of plastic"" as a result of the overcrowding.

In its latest report, UNRWA said up to 1.9m people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since the start of the war.

According to OCHA, the most recent wave of displacement into Rafah is due to intense fighting in Khan Younis and other parts of the territory.

Residents in Khan Younis have reported intense gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters.

Elsewhere in Gaza on Saturday, fighting was also reported in the Nuseirat refugee camp, Maghazi and in al-Bureij.

In a statement on X, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic-language spokesman warned that the main north-south road in Gaza, the Salah al-Din, was a ""battlefield"" and ""dangerous to reach"".

Meanwhile, a third UN body - the World Health Organization (WHO) - has again warned of a spike in the spread of infectious diseases across Gaza's displaced community.

WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a rise in the number of diseases across Gaza between mid-October and mid-December.","Israel-Gaza war: Displaced Gazans 'living in the open', UN saysReutersMany displaced Gazans are living ""in the open, in the parks,"" Juliette Touma of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has told the BBC.

Watch: A look back at some of Tom Wilkinson's memorable performances

British actor Tom Wilkinson, known for films like The Full Monty, Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has died aged 75.

Wilkinson won a Bafta for 1997's The Full Monty, and reprised the role of Gerald when a Disney+ streaming series revisited the characters 26 years on.

He received six Bafta nominations in total as well as two Oscar nominations, for Michael Clayton and In The Bedroom.

He died suddenly at home with his wife and family, they said in a statement.

George Clooney, who starred with Wilkinson in the 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, praised the actor as ""the epitome of elegance"".

Paying tribute, he told Variety magazine: ""Tom made every project better. Made every actor better.

""He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.""

With more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.

He also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.

His death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.

Wilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, ""a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain"".

Robert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as ""a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.""

In a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him ""powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best"", while singer and actor Will Young described him as ""British acting royalty"".

US film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was ""an amazing talent"" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

Tom Wilkinson (right) played Gerald in The Full Monty

Born in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.

""For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,"" he said.

""I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.""

He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.

Playing alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.

When he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: ""I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.""

Three years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.

""I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,"" he told The Guardian.

""I remember phoning a friend and he said, 'Take the TV, take the TV'. But I didn't follow his advice, and the TV turned out to be crap.""

The low-budget movie, meanwhile, turned out to be the highest-grossing British film up to that point, and took his career to a new level on both sides of the Atlantic.

A highly venomous snake interrupted play during Dominic Thiem's victory against James McCabe at the Brisbane International qualifying event.

Former US Open champion Thiem was a set down to Australian McCabe when the snake was spotted near the courtside electrical wires.

A 40-minute break in play followed while the reptile was safely removed by a professional snake catcher.

""I really love animals, especially exotic ones,"" Thiem said afterwards.

""But they said it was a really poisonous snake and it was close to the ball kids, so it was a really dangerous situation.

""It's something that has never happened to me and is something I'll definitely never forget.""

The animal was identified as a highly venomous eastern brown snake and was approximately 50cm in length.

Following the delay, Thiem recovered to win 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 and advance to the second and final round of qualifying for the Brisbane International.

The Austrian, who has slipped to 98th in the world rankings after injury struggles, is also expected to play in the qualifying draw for the Australian Open, which starts on 14 January.

Former world number one Rafael Nadal will mark his return in Brisbane on Sunday in a doubles match alongside Marc Lopez.

By Doug Faulkner & Harrison Jones BBC News

PA Media

New year plans for thousands have been thrown into chaos after Eurostar cancelled all its services to and from London St Pancras due to flooding in a tunnel under the River Thames.

Many frustrated passengers are now stranded in London and Paris, scrambling to rearrange New Year's Eve plans and find other travel routes.

Some were facing expensive hotel bills or costly airfares.

Eurostar has not yet said whether services will resume on Sunday.

But HS1, which operates the track, said the problems would ""take time"" to resolve.

A video taken inside the flooded tunnel shows water gushing onto the tracks from a pipe attached to the tunnel's wall.

Thames Water said a ""fire control system"" was likely to have caused the flooding, rather than one of its own pipes.

All Southeastern's high-speed services to Ebbsfleet, which use the same line, were also cancelled.

This video from Southeastern railway shows water gushing from a pipe into the tunnel

Eurostar, which runs services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, said affected customers were entitled to a full refund or exchange.

At a crowded St Pancras on Saturday, disappointed travellers sat on suitcases, frantically trying to find alternative routes.

Christina David, 25, and Georgina Benyamin, 26, from Sydney, saw their train cancelled after travelling around Europe on a budget for three weeks.

They planned to ""go hard"" for their final stop in Paris - where they hoped to celebrate the New Year at an expensive hotel with a view of the Eiffel Tower - before flying home.

Ms Benyamin said she wanted to see Paris ""light up"" but was now feeling frustrated and angry.

""There were lots of people crying,"" said her friend, Ms David. ""We don't know where to go, we have nowhere to stay.""

There were similar stories from across the Channel.

Curt Downs, his wife Megan and their one-year-old son were among hundreds stuck at Paris' Gare Du Nord station, after their train was cancelled.

""Eurostar staff there were completely overwhelmed and couldn't really suggest anything for us,"" he told BBC News.

One staff member told them they had 4,000 passengers to assist, but all flights from Paris and ferries from Calais were sold out, he said.

Mr Downs said the family spent two hours trying to find a way back to the UK, looking for ferries, car hire and flights.

They managed to get some of the last seats on a £450 flight from Paris to Manchester, from where Mrs Downs' mother is doing a five-hour round trip drive to get them home to Bedfordshire.

Before it became clear all services were cancelled, Joshua Parisutham, 31, from Harrow in London, told BBC News that some travellers at St Pancras were offering their tickets to those who were particularly upset or desperate to travel.

And one man was seen wandering around the station clutching an iPad, saying ""taxi to Paris"".

At 17:30 on Saturday, the Port of Dover advised stranded Eurostar travellers that there was no remaining foot passenger availability for the day.

HS1, which operates the track, said engineers had worked through the night to remove water into Saturday morning but the volume of water was ""unprecedented"".

Pumps and tankers are on the site and water levels are reducing, the company added, and apologised for the inconvenience caused.

An HS1 spokesperson added on Saturday evening: ""We are doing everything possible to restore services but this is proving challenging and will take time.""

It is the second time in 10 days there has been major disruption to Eurostar services, with a ""last-minute strike"" by French workers halting trains before Christmas.

Separately, there is major disruption on Thameslink services - which run through London and across south-east England - and a reduced service on Northern Rail, which covers the north of England, due to staff shortages.

In Wales, the line between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog has been closed due to ""severe weather"", while trains between Swansea and Shrewsbury have been cancelled due to flooding.

Speed restrictions are in place on the West Highland Line until 09:00 on Sunday due to the forecast, Network Rail Scotland said. Some flights at Glasgow Airport were also delayed due to snow on the runway.

The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for wind, rain and snow for large parts of the UK, including:

Rain and snow for most of Scotland until midnight

Wind across Wales, the south of England and parts of the East Anglian coast until 03:00 on Sunday

By Tom Richardson & Tom Gerken BBC News

Marvel

Spider-Man 2 lets you play as two different versions of Spider-Man, Peter Parker and Miles Morales

Gamers have been spoiled for choice in 2023.

The past 12 months have produced so many hits you'd have struggled to complete half of them, let alone all of them.

That did not necessarily mean a good year across the whole industry: thousands of staff in hundreds of companies lost their jobs, and we also witnessed the permanent end of E3, the massive conference that was once the biggest event in the gaming calendar.

In such an eventful year it is easy to lose track - so here are some of the biggest games of 2023.

Baldur's Gate 3

Larian Studios

This role-playing game stunned players and critics with its depth - many players easily racked up 100-plus hours in the Forgotten Realms, the Dungeons & Dragons-based setting for the game.

The level of detail, vast customisation options, and flexible story impressed critics most: Belgian developer Larian made it possible to experience a completely different set of characters and choices each time you play.

Few were surprised when, in December, it picked up Game of the Year at the gaming industry's biggest awards ceremony - but it wasn't an outcome many would have foreseen at the start of the year.

""Baldur's Gate 3 was an unexpected success that took the world by storm,"" said gaming journalist Helen Ashcroft.

""There's a strong narrative, choices that matter, a beautiful open world, an incredible score and voice acting, interesting and varied quests, and so many different ways to play and story threads to explore.""

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Nintendo

The introduction of a crafting mechanic to Zelda proved a big hit

When the rest of the world said that Nintendo's handheld console, the Switch, was too old to impress, the Japanese company said: ""Just watch this.""

Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, which is considered one of the best games of all time. This new game took the original's vast open world and added the ability - called ultrahand - to craft contraptions by fusing together pretty much anything you can find.

That sort of freedom usually terrifies developers because it creates so much room for things to go wrong. But it worked, despite the ageing Switch hardware.

""Ultrahand is one of the best additions to the series and the things we can make with it are hilarious and useful,"" says Scottish Twitch streamer Argick.

""There's so much to do in the game and you can do it in pretty much any order you want without the game trying to push you elsewhere - I've still got to explore the rest of the depths.""

Alan Wake 2

Remedy

Just when we thought triple-A games were becoming safe and stale, along comes Alan Wake 2.

It is a bit like Finnish studio Remedy's previous leftfield works, but with an extra layer of weirdness splodged on top.

The supernatural horror narrative, told through the eyes of two main characters, made a lasting impression. The sumptuous presentation, mix of gameplay and live action, and wider themes made it feel like one of a kind.

And one memorable musical sequence - featuring the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard - became one of the most-talked about gaming moments of the year.

""That is one of the best set pieces of 2023 for me,"" said Argick. ""The song and the way it's all intertwined in the game world.

""It just makes that entire moment something special.""

Spider-Man 2

Marvel

Spider-Man 2 had a huge weight resting on its shoulders.

The current release slate for Sony - which makes the PlayStation 5 console - is thin and so it needed a win from Spider-Man 2, a game developed by PlayStation studio Insomniac.

Thankfully, it got it. This tightly crafted adventure landed exclusively on the PlayStation 5 to excellent reviews and became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever.

It was a cinematic, technical showcase. Plus, players enjoyed the diverse cast of characters and moving story, even if the gameplay wasn't a huge departure from other Spider-Man games.

Some players griped about the relatively short playtime, but the developers insisted it was worth the price of entry.

Insomniac ended the year as the victim of a huge ransomware attack, but until then, most of the discussion about the studio was people praising its latest, greatest title.

Lego Fortnite

Lego/Epic Games

Fortnite, the last-player standing shooting game, has more than 400 million registered players, but its makers aren't shy about wanting more.

That's probably even more true after its maker, Epic Games, laid off 800 staff earlier this year.

One big bid to draw in new users was its high-profile collaboration with Lego for a new mode called Lego Fortnite. Twitch streamer Dando said the mode - which replaces Fortnite's existing crafting materials with the famous bricks - was ""amazing"".

""It brings in that element of crafting, building and gathering resources - it's just one of those games you can turn on, switch off, and just be in another world.""

Lego Fortnite launched alongside Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival - two other modes designed to attract more people.

Dando said: ""Eventually you'll just launch Fortnite and if you're feeling a certain genre, you don't need to leave the game.""

Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty

CD PROJEKT RED

Cyberpunk was praised for its emotional story starring a motion-captured Idris Elba

Everyone loves a redemption arc, and that's what they got with this expansion to Cyberpunk 2077.

Polish studio CD Projekt Red has been on a quest to repair its reputation after the disastrous 2020 launch of the base game.

Expansion Phantom Liberty - as well as a 2.0 update which fixed the main game from top to bottom - was hailed as delivering the version of the game players should have had first time around.

Having Idris Elba in the starring role, and a story many players called genuinely moving, certainly didn't hurt.

It's not quite an underdog story (the main game sold more than 20 million copies) but it was happier ending to a turbulent tale.

""This is the kind of thing I love - seeing a game come out the other end like that,"" said Dando. ""It is almost like they've revived themselves.""

Hogwarts Legacy

WB GAMES

It was perhaps the most divisive game of 2023, with some outlets refusing to review it at all because of Harry Potter author JK Rowling's public comments relating to transgender people.

The author was kept at arms' length from this project, but it didn't stop loud calls for boycotts around the game's release.

Some critics gave it low scores, arguing it was impossible to separate art from artist, and some streamers opted not to play it despite the huge viewership numbers it generated. Ten months on from release, feelings are still strong.

As for whether it was any good, detractors criticised its repetitive combat and missions - but fans would tell you that it was enchanting to explore detailed replicas of their favourite locations from the stories.

And despite the protests, analysis from GamesIndustry.biz suggests that, in terms of physical copies, it was the best-selling game of 2023 in both the United Kingdom and United States.

Starfield

Bethesda

Pre-release hype for Starfield promised players the universe, but when they finally got the game its galactic exploration was not quite what many expected.

They got plenty of space - in the form of empty planets - but navigating between worlds was mostly hands-free and menu-based.

""It was immersive and it was really pleasant to just run about but then some of the mechanics themselves just felt a bit clunky,"" said Dando.

Many fans felt Starfield didn't live up to previous titles from studio Bethesda - the makers of the beloved Fallout and Elder Scrolls series.

But it broke records for the developer and for publisher Microsoft - no doubt driven by its availability on the Netflix-style Game Pass service.

Since that initial wave, Starfield's had a hard time on digital storefront Steam, where it's been hit with negative reviews.

Bethesda's promised regular updates and new features in 2024, so the adventure might not be over just yet.

Watch: What have we learnt from the GTA VI trailer?

One of the biggest gaming stories of this year concerned something that's not expected until 2025: Grand Theft Auto VI.

A 90-second trailer released in early December racked up 90.4 million views in 24 hours.

It confirmed much of what we already knew from leaks, such as the presence of the series' first voice-acted female protagonist.

But finally seeing the Rockstar-approved version of its debauched, riotous virtual Miami after almost 10 years of waiting sent fans wild.

Argick said: ""GTA VI going back to Vice City and looking like it has a Bonnie and Clyde theme going on has me thinking about grabbing it - it's absolutely going to be one of the biggest releases of the year when it drops.

Mr Trump faces several legal challenges heading into the 2024 presidential race

Donald Trump has been disqualified from running as a presidential candidate in two states, Colorado and Maine. So what does it mean for next year's general election?

Mr Trump is the clear frontrunner to be the Republican nominee in November 2024 and challenge Joe Biden for the White House. His campaign described both decisions as ""atrocious"" and an ""attempted theft of an election"".

The top election official in Maine ruled the former president was ineligible to run because of his actions around the Capitol riot. Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier.

But it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out.

Why did Maine make this ruling?

Unlike in Colorado, where the state's Supreme Court ruled on Mr Trump's eligibility, in Maine it was decided by the top electoral official because of a quirk in its constitution.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, issued a 34-page ruling that said Mr Trump must be removed from its Republican primary ballot because of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Section 3 disqualifies people who engage in ""insurrection or rebellion"" from holding federal office.

Her order said Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"".

Ms Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. She denied this and said it was ""thorough and based on the rule of law"".

Speaking to BBC News after her ruling, Ms Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the ""Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide"".

What happened in Colorado?

On 19 December, the Colorado Supreme Court said it found ""clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection"".

It was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

The lengthy 213-page ruling said Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to 6 January 2021 did constitute insurrection.

His lawyers had argued in Colorado that he should not be disqualified because he did not bear responsibility for the riot.

They also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection.

Can Donald Trump still stand in the 2024 election?

Yes. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively.

Hours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. Michigan's top court this week declined to hear a case seeking to disqualify Mr Trump.

Mr Trump is far ahead of his Republican rivals so can still win his party's nomination without competing in Colorado or Maine.

In the US, the two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses that begin in January.

In terms of the general election, in both states, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more.

What happens next?

It is now likely that the US Supreme Court will intervene to offer a ruling that would apply nationally.

That's because the Colorado Republican Party has appealed the state's ruling to the Supreme Court.

The top US court will decide whether to take up the case in the new year, but it is not clear when.

Mr Trump's name will remain on the ballot in Colorado until the Supreme Court makes a ruling or, in a less likely outcome, decides not to take up the case.

The Maine ruling is also on hold pending a legal appeal in the state's courts. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally.

The US justices will have to consider the legal arguments which will take time, but they will be under pressure to decide before the Colorado and Maine primaries on 5 March, the so-called Super Tuesday when the greatest number of states hold ballots.

The balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president.

Almost everything about the situation is unprecedented, leaving lingering questions about how this may affect the general election.

Maeva Marcus, the director of the Institute for Constitutional Studies at George Washington University, says the same ""rationale"" behind the Colorado ruling that disqualified Mr Trump from the primary ballot would ""hold for the general election"".

But it's too early to say what will happen in the general election in November until the issue works its way through the courts, she said.

Where do legal experts stand on this?

There are two key legal issues to consider.

One is whether Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to the storming of the US Capitol amount to insurrection.

The other is whether the office holders that Section 3 was aimed at barring should include the president.

A lower court in Colorado has already ruled that Mr Trump engaged in insurrection but the law did not apply to the office of the presidency.

The Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump.

Lawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech.

What is the political impact?

Mr Trump's campaign said the latest ruling is another example of the justice system being used to persecute him.

But there could be wider implications for the general election.

Dozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed.

If Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought.","Can Donald Trump still run for president after Maine and Colorado rulings?

The conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year. The front lines have hardly moved in the last few months but could the course of the war change in 2024?

President Volodomyr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped. Russia still controls about 18% of Ukraine.

We asked three military analysts how they think events may unfold in the coming 12 months.

War will drag on but not indefinitely

Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London

The prospects for an end of the war in Ukraine remain bleak. Compared with this time last year, Vladimir Putin is stronger, politically more than militarily.

The situation on the battleground remains uncertain. Recently, Ukraine's winter offensive seems to have come to a halt. But there is no Russian breakthrough, either. More than ever, the outcome depends on political decisions made miles away from the centre of the conflict - in Washington and in Brussels.

The West's impressive show of unity displayed in 2022, and that endured throughout 2023, is starting to vacillate.

The US defence aid package is held hostage by what President Biden rightly labelled ""petty politics"" in Washington. And the future of the EU's economic aid is seemingly dependent on Hungary's incongruous stance.

Hesitation in the West's capitals has emboldened Putin. His recent public appearances and defiant statements demonstrate that as far as he is concerned, Russia is in this for the long haul.

Getty Images

So, will the West have the strength and stamina to continue to oppose him and all that he represents?

The EU's decision to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova is more than just symbolic. It implicitly means continued backing for Kyiv, as a future in the EU for Ukraine would be impossible with a full-blown victory for Russia.

In Washington, a complete reversal of policy is unlikely.

While it is tempting to depict doomsday scenarios for US assistance as Trump's ratings rise in the polls, the former president, amid all the theatrics, did not walk out from Nato in 2016. And he would not singlehandedly be able to revolutionise America's 75-year-long transatlantic partnership.

This is not to say that the recent cracks in the Western camp are meaningless. For the West, and therefore for Ukraine, 2024 will be more difficult.

For democracies, long-term consensus in support for war has always been more complicated than for autocrats with no accountability.

While it is likely that the war will drag on throughout 2024, it cannot drag on indefinitely.

With Western hesitancy bolstering Russia, and in the absence of either a coup or a health-related issue leading to Putin's demise, the only foreseeable outcome will be a negotiated settlement that for now both sides continue to refuse.

A year of consolidation ahead

Michael Clarke, former director general of the Royal United Services Institute

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the return of major war to the European continent. The course of the conflict in 2023 marked the fact that industrial-age warfare had returned too.

Industrial-age warfare bends significant parts, or in some cases whole economies, towards the production of war materials as matters of priority. Russia's defence budget has tripled since 2021 and will consume 30% of government spending next year.

This will make the war in Ukraine a longer and more traumatic enterprise than anything Europe has known since the middle of the last century. The coming year will demonstrate whether Russia - and its suppliers in North Korea and Iran - or Ukraine - and its Western backers - are able and prepared to meet the voracious demands of industrial-age warfare.

It would be wrong to say that the front lines in Ukraine are stalemated, but both sides are capable of fighting each other to a standstill as they each try to take strategic initiatives.

Russian forces may try to push again along the entire front, at least to secure all of the Donbas region. Ukraine will probably try to exploit the success it has had in re-establishing its control over the western Black Sea and its vital trade corridor to the Bosphorus.

And Kyiv will likely also try to spring more military surprises on the Russian invaders to knock them off balance in some areas.

But in essence, 2024 looks like being a year of consolidation for both Kyiv and Moscow.

Russia lacks the equipment and trained manpower to launch a strategic offensive until spring 2025, at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Ukraine needs Western finance and military support to keep it in the war during next year while it, too, builds up its intrinsic strengths to create the conditions for a series of liberating offensives in the future.

Industrial-age warfare is a struggle between societies. What happens on the battlefield becomes ultimately only the symptom of that struggle.

The military course of this war in 2024 will be determined in Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang more than in Avdiivka, Tokmak, Kramatorsk or any of the devastated battlefields along the frontlines.

Ukraine will press Russia around Crimea

Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe

Russia lacks a decisive, breakthrough capability to overrun Ukraine and will do what it can to hold on to what it currently occupies, using the time to strengthen its defences while it hopes for the West to lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.

But Ukraine will not stop. It is in a fight for its survival and understands what Russia will do if it stops. More European nations are now talking about the need to step up aid in light of concerns that the US is weakening in its resolve.

Getty Images

I do, however, anticipate that early in the new year the US will rediscover its strategic backbone and pass the aid package that was delayed in Congress in December.

Therefore, I anticipate Ukraine will do the following in the coming months as it prepares to regain the initiative:

reconstitute units which have been worn down from months of fighting, which will be necessary for a renewed offensive

improve the recruiting system within Ukraine to maximise available manpower

increase production of ammunition and weapons

improve its ability to operate against strong Russian electronic warfare capabilities - jamming, intercepting, locating.

By early summer Ukraine will be able to use US-made F16 fighter jets for the first time, which it hopes will improve its ability to counter Russian aircraft and strengthen its own air defences.

The most strategically important part of Ukraine that remains occupied by Russia is Crimea, which is what we call the ""decisive terrain"".

Ukraine will do all it can to keep pressure on the Russians there to make it untenable for the Russian navy in Sevastopol, the handful of air force bases there and their logistics base at Dzankoy.

They have already proven the concept. With just three UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles, they have forced the commander of the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw a third of his fleet from Sevastopol.

The Ukrainians do not have unlimited resources of course, especially artillery ammunition and long-range precision weapons.","Ukraine war: Three ways the conflict could go in 2024Getty ImagesA Ukrainian soldier looks out from a tank near Bakhmut, eastern UkraineThe conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year.

By Noor Nanji Culture reporter

Reuters

They are the UK's most famous chimes, and one of the most recognisable sounds around the world.

Exactly a century ago, Big Ben's bongs were broadcast live to the country for the first time, as part of a New Year's Eve radio programme on the BBC.

It began a tradition where the chimes were regularly heard on air, and they ultimately became a sound synonymous with the BBC.

New microphones were recently installed as part of a major restoration project.

It's a seamless operation, getting the sounds from Big Ben to the homes of BBC Radio 4 listeners.

But it hasn't always been so easy.

On 31 December 1923, BBC engineer AG Dryland had to climb onto a rooftop opposite the Houses of Parliament in order to record the chimes, as he wasn't allowed in the clock tower.

He took with him a microphone, and transmitted the sound live.

Big Ben had been chiming since 1859, but this was the first time that its distinctive ""bong"" was heard outside of its immediate vicinity in Westminster.

That very first broadcast picked up lots of traffic noise because it was recorded from a distance.

But it paved the way for regular broadcasting of the chimes, which continues to this day.

Hearing the bells has mattered hugely to generations of people over the years.

UK Parliament

During the Second World War, Big Ben's chimes proved reassuring for many people

The sound of Big Ben has also heralded news of significant events, like the outbreak of World War Two.

""It has become a symbol of freedom,"" said Parliamentary Estates historian Mark Collins.

""The people who were hearing it during World War Two realised that there was one country which was still free. Thereafter, it was part of the meaning and the symbol of freedom.""

The bongs are now an integral part of BBC Radio 4's daily news bulletins, with the sound heard twice a day, at the start of the 18:00 and midnight news bulletins.

On Sundays, the sounds are heard three times over the day.

The bells are also broadcast live on special occasions, such as Armistice Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.

But there have been some notable exceptions, when the bells have been off air.

During World War Two, unbeknown to the public, the bongs were at times replaced by recorded ones for security reasons.

There have also been some freak events, such as in 1976, when the chiming mechanism broke due to metal fatigue, and had to be replaced by pips on Radio 4.

In 2017, the bongs were replaced by a recording again. That was due to a major restoration work taking place on the world-famous Elizabeth Tower, which houses the clock, Big Ben, and the four smaller quarter bells.

The Elizabeth Tower was shrouded in scaffolding for years as restoration work took place.

The work - the biggest repair and conservation project in the building's history - meant the exterior was covered in scaffolding and the bell itself was silenced.

Costs ballooned to £80m and the project took a year longer than expected.

""It was important in order that we could restore the building for future generations,"" says Charlotte Claughton, senior project leader at the House of Commons.

""There was stonework crumbling, also the great clock hadn't had a major overhaul in over 30 years at that point.""

Ms Claughton said the infrastructure was updated during the works, including bringing in new lighting and microphones.

The work has now been completed, and in November, live bongs once again returned to Radio 4's news bulletins.

Ahead of New Year's Eve, extra microphones are brought in to help broadcast the countdown at midnight.

And with people across the country waiting for the sound of 12 chimes signalling the start of 2024, it's a big day for Big Ben's clock mechanics like Andrew Strangeway,

""We'll be here on the day, making sure the clock is running precisely to time,"" Mr Strangeway said.

""We'll be taking time checks throughout the day and making small adjustments to the pendulum, just to make sure that midnight happens exactly when everyone is expecting it to.""","Big Ben: New Year's Eve marks 100 years of live bongs on radioBy Noor Nanji Culture reporterReutersThey are the UK's most famous chimes, and one of the most recognisable sounds around the world.

Strikes swept the globe in industries including automotive, transport, healthcare and more (Credit: Alamy)

AI, return-to-office, the summer of strikes and more: both labourers and employers found themselves working through a rollercoaster of changes this year.

The work world has been a moving target for a while now. In 2023, some of the unresolved issues of the past three years settled, especially around the return to office. Yet evolving technology and a surge in organised labour meant plenty of new themes cropped up. They combined for a year of work unlike any other.

AI began its inevitable rise

The launch of ChatGPT on 30 November

2022 set the stage for a tidal wave of workplace changes in 2023. The impact of artificial intelligence on the labour force ­– and the future of work as we know it – was perhaps the most high profile topic of the year. And for good reason.

Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers. Recruiters began to see job applicants sending in materials written with ChatGPT; workers began to integrate the technology into their daily jobs – depending on it to the point that they found ways to secretly access the tools if they were banned.

One of the most ubiquitous worries – even existential concerns – among workers was whether AI would come for their jobs, especially as 2023 data from firms including Goldman Sachs and McKinsey and Company indicated replacement-by-robot may be imminent for many people.

The answer is still murky. Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service. Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.

It's not quite time to panic, though. First, many experts say there are jobs that will be difficult to automate outright – especially roles that require a human touch, sophisticated interpersonal relationships or out-of-the-box thinking.

And for positions that might be more vulnerable, experts also predict AI will end up as a supplementary technology, instead of an outright mechanism for replacement. At this point, AI is largely automating rote, repetitive tasks that can be a time-suck for workers, and could free up employees to do higher-level, more creative tasks. It also could push them to upskill, which may have long-term benefits.

At this point, experts recommend workers embrace AI, rather than fear it. The more people can understand the technology – both what it can and can't do – the more they'll be poised to work with it in ways that can advance them, and help them stay valuable to their employers.

Return-to-office became a reality

For many workers, the days of resisting return-to-office policies are over. After nearly three years of push-and-pull between employees and bosses, millions of workers are back in offices, at least partially – whether or not they want to be.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow.

While many companies have stuck with hybrid set-ups, others, such as Goldman Sachs and Disney, have leaned hard into this newfound power, recalling their employees four-to-five days per week. Others, including Amazon, have threatened workers who ignore these mandates – either denying them the opportunity to advance, or moving to terminate their employment entirely. Many companies who haven't fully returned yet have plans to do so in 2024.

If the switch seems jarring, it is. Since some offices began reopening in early 2021, workers have largely been able to make their own rules about whether they come in or not, despite years of heavy-handed pushes from leaders. Yet as job opportunities have tightened, it's far more difficult to snub these directives, since the Great Resignation is ""over"", and most workers can't easily hop into another job. And even for the new roles that are popping up, just a small percentage offer a fully remote set-up.

Yet experts are important to caveat that workers haven't entirely lost, even if they're back into their daily commute a few times a week.

The mainstreaming of hybrid set-ups means workers still have unprecedented flexibility and are unlikely to lose it entirely. Kastle Systems, which tracks employee access-card swipes for many businesses, has shown office attendance in 2023 is still a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic. Going forward, many jobs will have a hybrid schedule – a privilege formerly afforded to a select few, mostly senior employees.

Labour found its voice

""Summer of strikes"", ""hot labour summer"" – whatever the name, workers made their voices heard in 2023. Across the world, millions of people throughout many sectors organised, looking for better conditions and wages as well as career security for the future.

In the UK and US, healthcare workers conducted high-profile strikes after years of pandemic-era burnout and understaffing. Workers in transport, education and service joined them in the hundreds of thousands. But two US-based strikes particularly captured attention on the global stage.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow

On 2 May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), representing more than 10,000 screenwriters, hit the picket line over issues including pay in the era of streaming-media dominance, and future protections against evolving AI technology. The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) also went on strike on 14 July, with the two powerful unions standing in solidarity over shared concerns.

Then, on 14 September, workers at the three largest automakers in the country – GM, Ford and Stellantis – walked off the job. The members of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) were not only looking for pay increases from the executives that make millions, but also seeking to secure their jobs in an industry that is increasingly moving towards EVs.

These disputes finally settled in the autumn, with all unions securing unprecedented gains, especially around wage boosts and job-futureproofing.

Experts say moments like this may be poised to continue. Not only have the successes of these labour movements inspired and empowered workers, but data also shows Gen Z is highly supportive of organised labour. As the next generation become a larger part of the workforce, they are likely to lead more pro-union pushes.

Work perks, redefined

Throughout the past few years, perks like ping-pong tables and kombucha on tap have faded as must-haves for worker satisfaction. The pandemic transformed what workers wanted from their employers, including new wellness benefits, or flexibility to work where and when they wished. Employers have largely listened – if not magnanimously, then at least out of the desire to attract and retain talent.

This year, perks have evolved even more, as workers across the globe have settled into their post-pandemic lives. Employers have begun to modernise their benefits suites as workers settled flexible work patterns, prioritised work-life balance and found themselves with different responsibilities at home.

Some companies are hoping to make jobs more fun, offering their workers multi-thousand-dollar travel stipends to unplug, or even doling out spot bonuses in the form of points redeemable for goods and services. Others are looking at things more tactically, offering perks such as pet-friendly offices and spaces for childcare – even donations to charity for each day in the office ­– to incentivise workers back to their desks.

Perhaps this year's most notable shift, however, is the expansion of perks catering to an oft-overlooked group of workers: Gen X. An increasing number of employers are integrating benefits that help this ""sandwich generation"" – often caring for children and ageing parents at once – live life a healthier, more balanced life. Some of these new offerings include menopause support, healthcare screenings, eldercare and even ""gran-ternity leave"".

Experts say these benefits are a direct way to address worker happiness, and can pay off for employers, too; firms can become more appealing employers for older workers, who are often of leadership age. It's often a good deal for both parties.

Living on #worktok

Work culture found its way onto social media in a big way this year with #worktok. Creators across many platforms – particularly TikTok – invited users to get ready with them for their workdays, and toured them through their offices and daily grinds, often amassing millions of views. Sometimes they complained about their employers, and even quit on livestreams (accordingly, #quittok).

Perhaps most notable were the commentaries on work culture that came from this social media moment. The ""lazy girl job"", coined in May by 26-year-old Gabrielle Judge, particularly resonated with a group of workers who want to clock fewer hours and do less work (who wouldn't?). Her videos racked up hundreds of hundreds of thousands of views, and launched a tag with millions of impressions.

The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts. This is especially true as work and life increasingly bleed into each other, and young people in particular have not had the formative workplace interactions to build real world relationships.

""If you're working from home, you don't have that water cooler moment. Maybe if you come into a job during the pandemic, you might not have workmates who you're super close with,"" says Sara McCorquodale, the founder of UK-based influencer intelligence business CORQ. Along with creating community, she says, #WorkTok enables people to put a voice to one of the most important facets of their lives. It won't stop anytime soon.

It's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce

Workers stayed put – but checked out

The Great Resignation defined the past few years in the workplace. It was a sign of worker empowerment; since 2020, millions of employees – especially in the US – left their jobs for new ones that made them happier, were more aligned with their values or improved the overall quality of their lives.

Yet as the labour market tightened this year amid mass layoffs and an uncertain economy, mid-2023 data began to show the turnover rate for US employees had normalised to pre-pandemic levels. The shift was so significant, that in August, economists declared the Great Resignation's finale.

For workers, this marked the end of an era in job mobility. And that's bred another problem: it's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce.

Subsequently, employees are leaning out of their work. Think the ""quiet quitting"" trend of 2022, at the next level.

In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work. This mentality doesn't only lead to pesky dissatisfaction – it can also contribute to lower levels of personal wellbeing, says Jim Harter, chief scientist for workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup.

This leaves workers in a bad place, of course, but companies also stand to suffer, since productivity and morale falls off a cliff with disengagement. So, as workers check out, experts say it's up to leaders to light their employees' fires again. That means investing in their careers, supporting them with the same earnestness they did during the pandemic and working on building culture.

It may be tempting for employers to sit back if they're not fearful their employees will leave – but such a decision stands to hurt everyone.

A serious look at four-day workweeks

Four-day workweek trials kicked off in 2022, and spread across the globe in 2023, both in public and private sectors. In many cases, they have been successful; after the large-scale UK four-day workweek pilot from February, 92% of participating employers said they would continue with a shorter workweek following the programme. Nearly a third made the change permanent.

Workers have reported lower burnout and stress, and relished the time off. Companies have loved seeing their workers happier and more engaged, which has led to sustained productivity and employee retention. More companies are giving the four-day workweek a go, with others codifying the set-up in the coming months. Some firms are also giving the format a try with the hope that a shorter week may lure workers back into the office.

Are 32-hour workweeks imminent for all workers? As positive as the results have been – and even as more firms jump in –­ probably not.

For instance, not every company that's tried it has declared the experiment a resounding success; some leaders found cramming five days of work into four was stressful for employees, and sometimes failed customers. Other firms simply may not be set up to ever implement the change – whether due to the nature of their businesses, or because it's not a cultural fit.","Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers.
Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service.
Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.
The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts.
In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work."

Adama Jalloh/British Vogue

Ellie always wanted to be a model but says she did not see anyone who looked like her on magazine covers

When Ellie Goldstein was born in December 2001, doctors said she would never be able to walk or talk due to having Down's syndrome.

She soon proved them wrong. Ellie went on to make history as the first model with the condition to feature on the front cover of Vogue.

Now aged 22, she has just bought her own home in Essex and recently published a book about her life, called Against All Odds.

Here, in their own words, the model and her mother Yvonne explain how Ellie has been defying expectations since the day she was born.

Yvonne's story

Yvonne Goldstein

Ellie was diagnosed with Down's syndrome at birth and her parents were told she needed heart surgery

When Ellie was born, we were shocked to learn she had Down's syndrome. The doctors said she would never walk or talk and a nurse suggested we might want to leave her at the hospital. I struggled to accept her diagnosis and bond with her.

We were told Ellie needed heart surgery so I was really nervous about getting close to her. When she was five months old, she had a 10-hour operation to close holes in her heart. She spent 10 days in intensive care and another week in the high dependency unit.

After three weeks, we were able to take her home and her cheeky and determined personality began to shine through. My husband and I decided to bring her up as Ellie first and put the fact that she has got Down's syndrome to one side.

Ellie's picture became the most-liked post on Gucci Beauty's Instagram account

Despite what the doctors said, she could walk by 18 months, was speaking by her third birthday and was able to read by the time she started school. Ellie stayed in mainstream education until it came to doing her exams and we moved her to a specialist school.

When she was a teenager, we decided to tell Ellie that she had Down's syndrome. We were nervous about her reaction and showed her a special book but she kept saying, ""I don't look like that. I'm me."" I was worried it would knock her confidence, but it didn't.

Yvonne Goldstein

Yvonne says Ellie has always had a love of reading and she has got a good memory, which is great for learning monologues and scripts at her perfoming arts college

One day my friend told me about a new talent agency called Zebedee, which wanted to work with people with disabilities and visible differences, so I decided to apply for Ellie.

Not long after joining, Ellie was chosen to star in Superdrug's Christmas advert in 2018. Her career really took off from there. My mum always used to say, ""She's definitely going to be someone one day."" She is very headstrong and feisty but that's what makes her Ellie.

Ellie Goldstein has been modelling for five years

Ellie still really shocks me, she just loves the camera and the attention, I can just see how much she enjoys it and loves it and that makes it all worthwhile.

Ellie recently bought her own home with the proceeds from her modelling but we don't know if she will ever be able to live alone. We are living alongside her for now, though we have kept our family home, and we are trying to encourage her to be more independent but she is still very vulnerable.

We have to prepare her for how she will cope one day when we're not around. Her older sister Amy will obviously look out for her but we would never put that full responsibility on her.

I hope attitudes towards Down's syndrome have changed since Ellie was born but there is still a lot of ignorance. Often in the street, people ask me questions about Ellie and don't address her. They don't realise she can talk and how big a personality she has.

Ellie's story

Lauren Hillier/Unhidden

Ellie modelled for the adaptive clothing brans Unhidden during London Fashion Week

I always wanted to be a model but I didn't see anyone who looked like me on magazine covers so I wasn't sure if I could do it but now I am living my dream.

I didn't realise I would be famous one day but I have so much fun dressing up and wearing beautiful dresses. I did three catwalks at London Fashion Week this year and they were brilliant.

Looking back at this year, there have been so many good things, but the best bit was probably when my book was published. I was so proud and really excited. I thought, ""Wow it's my own book, I can actually read it.""

This year I have also been filming for a Channel 4 documentary all about my agency, which is going on TV next year, I can't wait to watch it.

I'm in my last year of performing arts college now and I really want to carry on modelling and acting when I leave. I never get nervous. I'm very confident and very cheeky.

Adama Jalloh/British Vogue

Ellie made history as the first person with Down's syndrome to feature on the cover of Vogue

When I did the Vogue shoot, I didn't know if my photo was going to be on the cover. My favourite teachers were there when I found out, I was at college, and I was crying and screaming. My friends said ""we love you"" and ""we are proud of you"" and ""well done"".

The first Barbie with Down's syndrome came out earlier this year and they asked me to do a photoshoot. I felt honoured and proud. When I saw the doll I thought ""Oh my god, I love it."" It was great to see a doll that looks like me.

Mattel

Ellie said she was honoured and proud to be able to show off the new Barbie doll to the world

My absolute favourite thing in the world is dancing. One day I would love to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I went to watch it being filmed a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to be in the audience, I wanted to be on the dancefloor!

I've just bought a new house and I can't wait for Christmas. I love spending time with my nephew who is two and opening lots of presents. I love being his aunty and I give him lots of cuddles.

I am proving people wrong and I am a role model for people like me. Doctors said I wouldn't talk but now I never stop talking! You should always believe in yourself.

One day I want to model in New York on a red carpet and on a catwalk.

Never give up on your hopes and dreams, be who you are and always be happy. Just go out there and rock it.

Prof. Barratt is working on contraception that prevents sperm cells from reaching an egg

A Welsh scientist working on a new male pill wants to reduce the burden on women of protecting against unwanted pregnancies.

Prof Chris Barratt is leading research on a non-hormonal drug which prevents sperm cells from reaching an egg.

His team at the University of Dundee has received significant funding from the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation.

""It's been a very poorly researched topic for 40 or 50 years,"" Prof Barratt said, but society has changed.

His team's research could see men given a gel or a pill that would affect the sperm cell, effectively disabling its function.

Instead of targeting the production of sperm, his research focuses on slowing the sperm cells' swimming action down and making them similar to those in infertile patients.

""The sperm cells are still produced in the same numbers so there's no effect on the man. It's just that those cells wouldn't be able to reach an egg and fertilise eggs,"" Prof Barratt said.

Prof Chris Barratt and his team have received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

The team received £3.45m ($4.4m) of funding in October from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

Existing birth control pills prevent women's ovaries from releasing an egg and contain hormones which often produce side effects that can last months.

""It takes about three months to shut that factory down and it clearly doesn't work all the time, and there are some side effects.

""And then it takes three months to switch the system back on again,"" Prof Barratt said.

A non-hormonal pill could take just hours to disable the sperm, while hormonal birth control pills may take a few days to be effective and it would also be reversible within hours, he added.

Other groups are working on different types of approaches for male contraception but Dundee's approach is unique, Prof Barratt said, and could produce a non-hormonal contraceptive that works in both men and women.

Would men take it?

Keeping the side effects as low as possible is crucial to a wide take-up of the pill by men.

The compound his team is working on could also be given to women to block sperm in the female tract.

This would offer women a non-hormonal alternative form of birth control, meaning the side effects would be much reduced.

The Gates Foundation was keen to explore it in women too, Prof Barratt explained, and his team's approach has always been designed to cover both.

University of Dundee

Prof Barrat's team at the University of Dundee's School of Medicine is working on non-hormonal contraception

Large pharmaceutical companies have historically shown very little interest in the area and ""the safety bar is very high, so they've always been reluctant to get into the subject without somebody showing a bit of progress,"" Prof Barratt said.

The work is still in the discovery phase, but he hopes to be able to start clinical trials for safety in the next few years, followed by trials for efficacy in four to five years.

""The purpose of the Gates Foundation is largely to show progress,"" he explained.

Life ambition

Born and raised in Welshpool, a market town in Powys, Prof Barratt, who now leads the reproductive medicine department at the University of Dundee's School of Medicine, said he still feels ""naturally Welsh"".

""I lived in Wales until I was 22, the formative years in college and school. It's just part of me,"" he added.

He studied Zoology at Swansea University and obtained a PhD at the University of Birmingham.

Through the Gates foundation, his team is part of a global network collaborating with other groups working on different targets.

While it is collaborative, he said his team also needed to be competitive in its quest for progress.

""You're competing, but at the same time you're trying to get humanity over the fence. You can't let that stand in the way of progress for humanity,"" he said.","Male pill: The scientist working on 'progress for humanity'Getty ImagesProf. Barratt is working on contraception that prevents sperm cells from reaching an eggA Welsh scientist working on a new male pill wants to reduce the burden on women of protecting against unwanted pregnancies.

Handout

Noah spent part of Christmas in hospital after a hot drink spilled on him while visiting a Christmas light trail in Lincolnshire

A six-year-old boy suffered serious burns after a hot drink was accidentally spilled on him during a festive outing, his mother said.

Kirsty and husband Sam had taken Noah and his three siblings to a light show at Belton House in Lincolnshire on 16 December.

Another visitor was believed to have spilled mulled wine or cider from a cup without a lid, leaving Noah screaming.

National Trust, which manages the site, told the BBC it was investigating.

Warning: Distressing images of burn injuries are contained below

Kirsty, whose family had travelled to the Grade I listed property near Grantham from their home in Peterborough, claimed ""boiling hot"" drinks were being sold without lids.

She hoped that sharing her family's ordeal would serve as a warning and prevent a reoccurrence.

""Accidents happen but the damage might have been much more limited had the cup had a lid,"" she said.

""We want to warn people to always ask for a lid when they buy hot drinks.""

Noah is due a skin graft operation on Thursday

Describing Noah's ordeal, Kirsty said: ""Suddenly, Noah started making the most horrific noise. He was clawing at his neck in pain.

""We didn't see it happen, but a man approached my husband and said he had bumped into Noah. He didn't disclose he had spilt a drink.""

Kirsty said their son's neck was ""blistering and turning red"", so helped him to take off his coat and jumper, as staff from the drinks kiosk gave the family a five-litre bottle of water to pour on to the burns.

A first-aider arrived and an ambulance was called, which took Noah, accompanied by his warehouse supervisor father, to a specialised burns unit in Nottingham.

Kirsty said: ""Even after what had just happened, I was surprised to be handed a hot drink that also did not have a lid on.

""It was so hot that I couldn't drink it at first.""

'Stressful' Christmas

Since the incident, the family have made several trips to both their local hospital and Nottingham - a 130-mile round trip.

Noah has also endured overnight stays when his wounds became infected over the Christmas period, Kirsty said.

Doctors told his family he had suffered 5% burns to his body, including his neck, upper chest and right shoulder.

Noah is due to undergo a skin graft operation on Thursday.

""The surgeons are intending to take some skin from his thigh and graft it on to his shoulder and upper back,"" said his mother.

A National Trust spokesperson said: ""The safety and well-being of all our visitors is really important to us. We're taking this incident very seriously and we're working with event managers Raymond Gubbay Ltd to investigate what happened. Our thoughts are with the family involved.""

Noah was able to spend Christmas Day at home with his parents, brothers and sister.

Kirsty said: ""It's not been a good Christmas. It's been stressful. It's been emotional.

By Bethany Bell BBC News, Vienna

BBC

Under the voucher scheme, Austria will pay up to €200 ($219; £173) to repair broken electronics

Has your washing machine broken down, or is your electric kettle, laptop or mobile phone refusing to work?

Well if you live in Austria, the government will pay up to €200 ($219; £173) towards getting it repaired.

The Repair Bonus voucher scheme is aimed at trying to get people to move away from throwing away old electrical appliances - and focusing on getting things mended.

Erik's laptop is broken, so he has come to Helferline, a computer and mobile phone repair workshop in Vienna. Because of Austria's Repair Voucher scheme, he will only have to pay 50% of the repair costs to get it fixed.

""It's an old laptop, and I'm trying to make it go again, instead of buying a new one,"" he said.

Erik has already used the Repair Bonus to mend an old CD player, which is now working well. He says the scheme makes it easier to decide whether or not to throw something away.

""Yeah, it helps, because usually handcraft and people fixing things is much more expensive than buying a new one. This way, things can be saved.""

At the back of the workshop, Lukas, a technician, checks out the motherboard of an old laptop. Around him are stacks of boxes full of computers and phones which have been brought to be mended.

Helferline's chief executive, Clemens Schmidgruber, says the Repair Bonus scheme has been great for his business.

""Our revenues have doubled since it was introduced. So we're very happy about it,"" he said.

""It is a real win-win situation for customers, for local businesses and of course for the environment.

""Customers benefit because it helps them save a lot of money. Of course, it's good for local businesses because they generate additional revenues. And the environment benefits, because there's less electronic waste.""

Mr Schmidgruber says customers have to download a voucher from a government website and then pay the repair shop upfront. ""Then you get back half of the costs after three to four weeks.""

The Austrian government's repair voucher system, which is financed through the Covid Recovery Fund, is just for electrical appliances.

But the City of Vienna runs a separate scheme - which works in a similar way and helps people pay for repairs to old clothes, bicycles or furniture.

Markus Piringer, the co-ordinator of the Repair Network in Vienna, says ""if the costs of the repair are more than 20-30% of the cost of the new product, people tend to buy new. And as the Repair Bonus lowers those costs, it's a big incentive to repair more.""

But he says the financial aspect of repair, while very important, is just one part of the picture.

""Another very important point is that the products have to be repairable. So, we [need to] work on this at European Union level and more effort needs to be taken to really get things going there.""

Austria's capital Vienna has a separate voucher to help people repair bicycles, furniture and old clothes

Markus says it's all about changing policies and mindsets.

""For many people, it's still very positive to have always the newest product and to throw away your clothing after half a year or even less. And so this is also something where we need awareness raising.""

And he warned that while the number of repairs was rising in Austria because of the voucher schemes, there were still too few technicians and craftspeople to do it. ""We have a problem that we don't have enough repairers. So we also need a system which is promoting repairs as a job. We are working on this at the moment.""

At his bicycle shop in Vienna, Marc Warnaar and his team are fixing a bike, which has rusted brake and gear cables.

""They don't make spare parts for this gear system,"" he says, ""Especially the gear cables, you cannot buy them anymore. So what we'll do is exchange them with a newer model, so it will run again.""

By Paul Kirby BBC News

Moscow courts

Anastasia Ivleeva (R) appeared at Lefortovo court in Moscow on Friday

TV presenter and influencer Anastasia Ivleeva has already apologised twice for hosting an ""almost naked"" party in a Moscow club that sparked a moral backlash in wartime Russia.

Now Lefortovo court in Moscow has imposed a 100,000-rouble (£870; $1,100) fine on her for arranging it.

""I would like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,"" she pleaded in an Instagram video this week.

She was convicted of organising a mass presence that violated public order.

But Friday's fine may not be the end of her public humiliation.

A remorseful Ivleeva has already promised to donate the proceeds of ticket sales to charities.

But another court has registered a billion-rouble class action lawsuit against her for ""moral damage"", signed by 22 people, who want her to hand the billion to a group that donates money to Russians fighting in Ukraine.

After the party, held on 20 December at Moscow's Mutabor nightclub, video emerged of well-known Russian celebrities dressed in underwear and lingerie, and in one case a strategically placed sock and a pair of shoes.

What had been a private party quickly became public property amid a wartime climate of increasing intolerance. It also served as a distraction from anger at the rising price of eggs.

Russian rapper Vacio, whose single-sock outfit led to his arrest, has since been handed a 15-day jail term for ""disorderly conduct"". Otherwise known as Nikolai Vasiliev, he was found guilty of promoting ""non-traditional sexual relations"" and handed a fine twice that of Ivleeva's.

In the words of BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who supported the war, were furious. ""How could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the 'special military operation'?""

""Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this,"" said pro-censorship activist Yekaterina Mizulina, who runs Russia's League for a Safe Internet.

More from Steve Rosenberg: Moral backlash for guests of Ivleeva's 'almost naked' party

Other guests have been punished in different ways, with concerts or sponsorship contracts cancelled. Some are said to have been removed from Channel One's glitzy pre-recorded New Year's Eve TV show, which many Russians may now watch to spot who has been edited out.

Veteran singer Lolita Milyavskaya says her gigs are being cancelled and she is being ""cut out of television"". Anastasia Ivleeva herself has seen her face vanish from mobile firm MTS's advertising campaign and her business is facing an audit from the tax service.

Former Eurovision singer Dima Bilan and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak have said sorry too.

So-called king of Russian pop Philipp Kirkorov was as profuse in his apology to the public as any of his fellow guests, saying simply: ""There are moments in everyone's life when you walk through the wrong door.""

Widely regarded as President Vladimir Putin's favourite singer, Kirkorov appealed for his ""mistake"" not to affect his career in ""Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen"".

Suggestions that he might be deprived of his ""Order of Honour"" appear to be false, but he has been removed from a poster for a New Year's Eve TV film called ""Ivan Vasilievech changes everything"".

The remake of a popular old Soviet-era film features Kirkorov as Peter the Great and the TV channel director has said some of the scenes are being re-shot before it airs.","Russian influencer Ivleeva fined for hosting 'almost naked' partyBy Paul Kirby BBC NewsMoscow courtsAnastasia Ivleeva (R) appeared at Lefortovo court in Moscow on FridayTV presenter and influencer Anastasia Ivleeva has already apologised twice for hosting an ""almost naked"" party in a Moscow club that sparked a moral backlash in wartime Russia.

By Rajini Vaidyanathan Reporting from Bangladesh

BBC

Mamun lost 16 of his relatives after they were struck by lightning on the day of his wedding

On the day he thought he'd be celebrating his wedding, Mamun buried 16 of his relatives.

They had been killed by lightning on the way to the ceremony.

Dressed in their finest saris and suits, his family members boarded a boat to join Mamun, when a heavy storm struck. As the rain lashed down the boat pulled over and they took shelter under a tin shed on the riverbank, when they were hit.

Bangladesh, which is blighted by extreme weather and heavy storms, suffers an average of 300 deaths by lightning every year, according to the UN.

That's compared with fewer than 20 annually in the United States, which has almost double the population.

It's a heavy burden for the South Asian nation, and for many like Mamun, who is speaking for the first time about what happened on that day in August 2021.

The 21-year-old was getting ready at his in-laws' home in the Shibganj area in the country's north-west, when he heard the crackle of thunder, minutes before he got the gut-wrenching news.

He rushed to his family, where he was confronted with a scene of chaos and confusion.

""Some people were hugging the bodies,"" Mamun recalls, ""the injured were crying out in pain… children were screaming. I was at a loss. I could not even decide who I should go to first.""

Mamun

The funerals took place on the evening of Mamun's wedding

Mamun lost his father, grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts. His mother wasn't on the boat and survived the lightning attack.

""When I found my father's dead body I simply burst into tears. I was so shocked I fell sick,"" Mamun says.

Later that evening, the funerals of his relatives took place - the wedding feast they were meant to enjoy was instead distributed to the homeless.

Mamun later got married, but says he doesn't celebrate his wedding anniversary as it triggers painful memories. ""After the tragic incident, now I am really scared of rain and thunder.""

Lightning is a big killer in Bangladesh, claiming more lives annually than floods.

Salman Saeed

Reported deaths and injuries due to lightning have increased greatly in Bangladesh

The number of reported deaths due to lightning has also risen steeply, from just dozens per year in the 1990s.

Nasa, the UN and the government of Bangladesh cite increased storminess due to climate change as a reason for the increase in deadly strikes.

""Global warming, environmental changes, living patterns are all factors for the increasing death toll due to lightning,"" Md Mijanur Rahman, the director general of Bangladesh's disaster management division, told the BBC.

Such is the seriousness, that the government has added lightning strikes to the official list of natural disasters the country faces which includes floods, cyclones, earthquakes and droughts.

The majority of victims of lightning are farmers, who are vulnerable to the elements as they work the fields through the rainy monsoon months in the spring and summer.

Salman Saeed

Abdullah was wearing his Barcelona shirt when he was struck by lightning

A football shirt, hanging on a rickety fence, overlooking a field in the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is a poignant reminder of one of the victims.

Just days earlier, the shirt had been worn by Abdullah as he went into the vast rice fields to do his day's work.

Now, draped over the wooden barrier, the Barcelona football shirt is singed and frayed, the burnt edges of thread show where the lightning left its mark in May this year.

Abdullah's wife of three decades, Rehana, took me to the field to tell me what happened the day she lost her husband.

It was bright and sunny as Abdullah and a group of farmers went to harvest rice. By late afternoon a heavy storm began, and a lightning bolt struck her husband.

""Some of the other farmers brought him to this roadside shop,"" Rehana says, pointing to a small shack along the lane. ""By then he was already dead.""

Salman Saeed

Back at Rehana's house, the rice Abdullah harvested a day earlier lies in fresh piles outside the small one-room dwelling.

The couple had recently taken out a loan to build a second room to extend their modest home.

Inside, the couple's 14-year-old son Masood is reading a book. With no primary earner, Rehana fears she will be left with a lifetime of debt and wonders how she will pay for his studies.

""The fear gripped me so deeply that now if I see a cloud in the sky, I don't even dare to let my son go outside any more,"" she says consumed by tears.

Salman Saeed

Rehana says she doesn't let her son outside following the death of her husband

Lightning is a growing concern in other countries too - including neighbouring India which has also seen a rise in the number of strikes in recent years, but a significant reduction in the number of fatalities due to a number of initiatives.

There are efforts in Bangladesh to do more to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning.

Activists say more tall trees need to be planted in remote rural areas to absorb the impact of the strikes, especially in places which have borne the brunt of deforestation.

They also call for a large-scale programme to build lightning sheds, so farmers can take safe shelter, and for broader early warning systems to alert people about possible storms.

One challenge is the poor connectivity and lack of mobile usage in the areas where people are the most vulnerable.

A lack of awareness is also a challenge. Many in the country don't realise how dangerous lightning can be - few people anywhere in the world expect to be hit by a thunderbolt.

Farmer Ripon Hossen - who was with Abdullah the day he was killed - never imagined what lightning would look like up close, until it struck.

Salman Saeed

Farmer Ripon Hossen says he is terrified to work in the open but needs the income from farming

""There was a big loud sound, and then I saw lots of flashing lights,"" he recalled. ""It was as if a disk of fire had fallen on us. I felt a great electric shock and fell to the ground.

""After a while, I opened my eyes and saw that Abdullah was dead.""

Ripon can't believe he survived. He says he's terrified to work in the open, but in this impoverished agricultural area farming is the only source of income for him.

""I cry whenever I think of my friend Abdullah,"" he says.

""When I close my eyes at night, all the memories of that day return like a flashback. I can't console myself.""","Bangladesh sees dramatic rise in lightning deaths linked to climate changeBy Rajini Vaidyanathan Reporting from BangladeshBBCMamun lost 16 of his relatives after they were struck by lightning on the day of his weddingOn the day he thought he'd be celebrating his wedding, Mamun buried 16 of his relatives.

Adama Jalloh/British Vogue

Ellie always wanted to be a model but says she did not see anyone who looked like her on magazine covers

When Ellie Goldstein was born in December 2001, doctors said she would never be able to walk or talk due to having Down's syndrome.

She soon proved them wrong. Ellie went on to make history as the first model with the condition to feature on the front cover of Vogue.

Now aged 22, she has just bought her own home in Essex and recently published a book about her life, called Against All Odds.

Here, in their own words, the model and her mother Yvonne explain how Ellie has been defying expectations since the day she was born.

Yvonne's story

Yvonne Goldstein

Ellie was diagnosed with Down's syndrome at birth and her parents were told she needed heart surgery

When Ellie was born, we were shocked to learn she had Down's syndrome. The doctors said she would never walk or talk and a nurse suggested we might want to leave her at the hospital. I struggled to accept her diagnosis and bond with her.

We were told Ellie needed heart surgery so I was really nervous about getting close to her. When she was five months old, she had a 10-hour operation to close holes in her heart. She spent 10 days in intensive care and another week in the high dependency unit.

After three weeks, we were able to take her home and her cheeky and determined personality began to shine through. My husband and I decided to bring her up as Ellie first and put the fact that she has got Down's syndrome to one side.

David PD Hyde/Gucci/Vogue Italia

Ellie's picture became the most-liked post on Gucci Beauty's Instagram account

Despite what the doctors said, she could walk by 18 months, was speaking by her third birthday and was able to read by the time she started school. Ellie stayed in mainstream education until it came to doing her exams and we moved her to a specialist school.

When she was a teenager, we decided to tell Ellie that she had Down's syndrome. We were nervous about her reaction and showed her a special book but she kept saying, ""I don't look like that. I'm me."" I was worried it would knock her confidence, but it didn't.

Yvonne Goldstein

Yvonne says Ellie has always had a love of reading and she has got a good memory, which is great for learning monologues and scripts at her perfoming arts college

One day my friend told me about a new talent agency called Zebedee, which wanted to work with people with disabilities and visible differences, so I decided to apply for Ellie.

Not long after joining, Ellie was chosen to star in Superdrug's Christmas advert in 2018. Her career really took off from there. My mum always used to say, ""She's definitely going to be someone one day."" She is very headstrong and feisty but that's what makes her Ellie.

Ellie Goldstein has been modelling for five years

Ellie still really shocks me, she just loves the camera and the attention, I can just see how much she enjoys it and loves it and that makes it all worthwhile.

Ellie recently bought her own home with the proceeds from her modelling but we don't know if she will ever be able to live alone. We are living alongside her for now, though we have kept our family home, and we are trying to encourage her to be more independent but she is still very vulnerable.

We have to prepare her for how she will cope one day when we're not around. Her older sister Amy will obviously look out for her but we would never put that full responsibility on her.

I hope attitudes towards Down's syndrome have changed since Ellie was born but there is still a lot of ignorance. Often in the street, people ask me questions about Ellie and don't address her. They don't realise she can talk and how big a personality she has.

Ellie's story

Lauren Hillier/Unhidden

Ellie modelled for the adaptive clothing brans Unhidden during London Fashion Week

I always wanted to be a model but I didn't see anyone who looked like me on magazine covers so I wasn't sure if I could do it but now I am living my dream.

I didn't realise I would be famous one day but I have so much fun dressing up and wearing beautiful dresses. I did three catwalks at London Fashion Week this year and they were brilliant.

Looking back at this year, there have been so many good things, but the best bit was probably when my book was published. I was so proud and really excited. I thought, ""Wow it's my own book, I can actually read it.""

This year I have also been filming for a Channel 4 documentary all about my agency, which is going on TV next year, I can't wait to watch it.

I'm in my last year of performing arts college now and I really want to carry on modelling and acting when I leave. I never get nervous. I'm very confident and very cheeky.

Adama Jalloh/British Vogue

Ellie made history as the first person with Down's syndrome to feature on the cover of Vogue

When I did the Vogue shoot, I didn't know if my photo was going to be on the cover. My favourite teachers were there when I found out, I was at college, and I was crying and screaming. My friends said ""we love you"" and ""we are proud of you"" and ""well done"".

The first Barbie with Down's syndrome came out earlier this year and they asked me to do a photoshoot. I felt honoured and proud. When I saw the doll I thought ""Oh my god, I love it."" It was great to see a doll that looks like me.

Mattel

Ellie said she was honoured and proud to be able to show off the new Barbie doll to the world

My absolute favourite thing in the world is dancing. One day I would love to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I went to watch it being filmed a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to be in the audience, I wanted to be on the dancefloor!

I've just bought a new house and I can't wait for Christmas. I love spending time with my nephew who is two and opening lots of presents. I love being his aunty and I give him lots of cuddles.

I am proving people wrong and I am a role model for people like me. Doctors said I wouldn't talk but now I never stop talking! You should always believe in yourself.

One day I want to model in New York on a red carpet and on a catwalk.

Never give up on your hopes and dreams, be who you are and always be happy. Just go out there and rock it.

Ms Abdul (bottom right) claims that Mr Lythgoe (top left) first assaulted her during an early season of American Idol

American singer and dancer Paula Abdul is suing British television executive heavyweight Nigel Lythgoe over alleged sexual assault.

Ms Abdul's lawsuit claims multiple instances of assault while the pair worked together on American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance.

Mr Lythgoe was an executive producer of the singing talent show and a co-judge on the dancing programme.

Neither Ms Abdul nor Mr Lythgoe have publicly commented on the case.

The BBC has contacted Mr Lythgoe's representatives for a response.

Ms Abdul alleges the first instance of assault occurred during one of the ""initial seasons"" of American Idol in the early 2000s, according to court documents seen by the BBC.

The lawsuit claims Mr Lythgoe assaulted her in an elevator while on the road during regional auditions for the popular talent programme.

She was able to escape from her boss when the doors opened, and she immediately informed her representatives from her hotel room, the lawsuit says.

The next occurred over a decade later, Ms Abdul claims, during what documents say she thought was a professional meeting at his home in Los Angeles.

She claims he forced himself on her, and told her they would make an excellent ""power couple"", to which she responded by pushing him off and explaining that she was not interested in his advances.

That same year, Ms Abdul claims she witnessed Mr Lythgoe assault one of her assistants during the filming of So You Think You Can Dance in Las Vegas.

The lawsuit also claims Mr Lythgoe ""taunted"" her by calling her and saying the pair should celebrate because it had been ""seven years and the statute of limitations had run"".

BABC LA

Mr Lythgoe received an award in LA this month from the British American Business Council for services to charity and entertainment

The court filing states that Ms Abdul has remained silent for years due to ""fear of speaking out against one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows who could easily break her career"", as well as professional contracts that ""prohibited"" her disclosing ""anything that might be deemed confidential business information"" or ""derogatory"".","Paula Abdul sues Nigel Lythgoe over alleged sexual assaultBy Jacqueline Howard BBC NewsGetty ImagesMs Abdul (bottom right) claims that Mr Lythgoe (top left) first assaulted her during an early season of American IdolAmerican singer and dancer Paula Abdul is suing British television executive heavyweight Nigel Lythgoe over alleged sexual assault.

Watch: A look back at some of Tom Wilkinson's memorable performances

British actor Tom Wilkinson, known for films like The Full Monty, Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has died aged 75.

Wilkinson won a Bafta for 1997's The Full Monty, and reprised the role of Gerald when a Disney+ streaming series revisited the characters 26 years on.

He received six Bafta nominations in total as well as two Oscar nominations, for Michael Clayton and In The Bedroom.

He died suddenly at home with his wife and family, they said in a statement.

George Clooney, who starred with Wilkinson in the 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, praised the actor as ""the epitome of elegance"".

Paying tribute, he told Variety magazine: ""Tom made every project better. Made every actor better.

""He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.""

With more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.

He also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.

His death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.

Wilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, ""a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain"".

Robert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as ""a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.""

In a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him ""powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best"", while singer and actor Will Young described him as ""British acting royalty"".

US film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was ""an amazing talent"" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

Tom Wilkinson (right) played Gerald in The Full Monty

Born in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.

""For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,"" he said.

""I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.""

He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.

Playing alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.

When he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: ""I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.""

Three years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.

""I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,"" he told The Guardian.

""I remember phoning a friend and he said, 'Take the TV, take the TV'. But I didn't follow his advice, and the TV turned out to be crap.""

The low-budget movie, meanwhile, turned out to be the highest-grossing British film up to that point, and took his career to a new level on both sides of the Atlantic.

Wilkinson received high critical acclaim for Todd Field's 2001 US domestic drama In the Bedroom, in which he played a bereaved father. He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor.

He hoped the film would do two things for him, he later said. ""One, [prove] I could play the lead role in a movie. Two, I could play an American lead role. And it did both of those things.""

The actor earned his second Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Tony Gilroy's 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney.

Wilkinson's other credits included Batman Begins, The Patriot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Gathering Storm, Black Knight, Valkyrie, The Lone Ranger and Denial.

He also provided the voice of the fox in the TV adaptation of children's best-seller The Gruffalo.

His long term agent Lou Coulson has described him in interviews as ""one of the best"".

Off screen, Wilkinson was known for being down-to-earth and keeping a relatively low profile. He said in an interview: ""I like to go to Waitrose and not be recognised.""","Tom Wilkinson: The Full Monty actor dies at 75Watch: A look back at some of Tom Wilkinson's memorable performancesBritish actor Tom Wilkinson, known for films like The Full Monty, Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has died aged 75.

By Max Matza BBC News

Surfers raced to California's famous Mavericks Beach surf spot to ride the huge waves

The world's best big wave surfers are descending on California to catch the biggest storm swells the US West Coast has seen in years.

Surfers from Brazil, France and Portugal have arrived at Mavericks, a famous wave south of San Francisco, to ride the giant walls of water.

Waves up to 70ft (21 meters) have been ridden, as even larger waves pass by.

Officials have warned onlookers to stay away from the shore after people were injured by huge rogue waves.

Chris Cuvelier, who runs the Maverick Surf Awards competition and can see the rolling swells from his kitchen, told BBC News on Friday that ""people have been getting on flights all over the world"" to surf the legendary spot this week.

Professional surfers, ""especially people that surf Mavericks, they're big wave surfers and many of them are travelling around the globe to go catch big waves"", he says.

Audrey Lambidakis/Maverick Surf Awards

Famous pros like Kai Lenny, Andrew Cotton, and Lucas Chumbo have all appeared at Mavericks recently - some of them vying to win the prize money on offer from the Maverick Awards.

Filming the ride of their lives in this swell means they can enter into the digital competition for a chance at the as-yet unannounced 2024 prize pool.

JoJo Roper, a San Diego-based pro surfer, loaded up his car after Christmas once he saw the ""gigantic"" swell in the forecast.

It was the biggest since at least 2007, he says, telling BBC News ""it's been a long time since it's been that kind of a day"".

Mr Roper, 33, said he was one of the only Californian surfers out there on Thursday, riding the 60-70ft waves.

His friend flew from Hawaii to tow him into the waves on a jet ski.

""It's nice to have it in our territory, and take advantage of some waves close to home rather than travelling to Portugal or where all these other guys come from to chase their waves,"" he told BBC News.

""They're coming to chase our waves. It's pretty cool. It all comes full circle.""

Speaking on Friday, he called Thursday ""one of the best days in my lifetime for sure"".

Eight people were injured as a rogue wave swamped people and vehicles in the city of Ventura

On his third wave of the day, he fired into the barrel of a massive collapsing wall of water.

""It was an honour. And just to get barrelled is a whole other realm of victory,"" he says with a triumphant laugh.

""So I'm pretty happy about it.""

Vinesh Phogat, seen here being detained by police in May, is a World Championship medallist

A top wrestler in India has returned two of her medals to highlight alleged sexual harassment of female athletes.

Vinesh Phogat, one of India's most decorated women wrestlers, left the prestigious awards on a roadside kerb after she was refused permission to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She and several wrestlers accuse former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Singh of sexually harassing women wrestlers for years.

Mr Singh denies the allegations.

Ms Phogat announced this week that that she was returning the Khel Ratna award, the country's highest sporting honour which she received in 2020, along with her Arjuna Award - both which are given by the government.

She had planned to deliver her awards to Mr Modi but was blocked by police.

Ms Phogat left her awards on a pavement in Delhi on Saturday. She said such honours had become meaningless at a time when wrestlers are struggling to get justice.

Protests by the wrestlers first began in January.

Ms Phogat - a two-time World Championship medallist - alleged that at least 10 women wrestlers had told her they had been sexually exploited by Mr Singh, who is an influential lawmaker and politician from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Ms Phogat said she has said that she had complained about him to the prime minister in 2021.

In May, the wrestlers alleged that they were abused and assaulted by police in Delhi where they had been protesting.

A close associate of Mr Singh was chosen as the new president of the federation earlier this month, triggering more angry protests by the wrestlers.

Another prominent female wrestler, Sakshi Malik, said she was quitting the sport in protest at the election of Mr Singh's loyalist.

Russia has been striking Kharkiv in recent days

Ukraine is again under attack by Russian drones, officials say, after two days of major aerial assaults by both sides.

There are reports of explosions in Kyiv and Kharkiv, where the mayor said residential buildings were on fire.

Moscow has been retaliating against Ukrainian strikes on the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday, which killed at least 20 people.

That came after Russia carried out strikes across Ukraine on Friday.

Those strikes, which killed 39 people, were described by Kyiv as Russia's biggest missile bombardment of the war so far.

The latest attacks happened as Ukraine entered its final day of 2023.

Ukraine's air defence systems in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv were engaged late on Saturday to repel a Russian drone attack, the military administration of the region said on Telegram.

Drone attacks have been reported in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.

""These are not military facilities, but cafes, residential buildings and offices,"" he said.

""On the eve of the New Year, the Russians want to intimidate our city, but we are not scared - we are unbreakable and invincible.""

The extent of the damage is not clear and no casualties have been reported yet.

Earlier on Saturday, Russian strikes injured 19 in Kharkiv, the local government reported.

The latest attacks come after a deadly couple of days in Ukraine and Russia.

Russia's massive bombardment of Ukraine on Friday killed 39 people and injured nearly 160, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Several cities were hit, including the capital, Kyiv.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitchsko, said at least 16 people were killed in the city - making Friday the deadliest day so far for civilians in the capital.

This was followed by Ukrainian attacks on Russia.

Moscow accused Ukraine of deadly air strikes on the south-west of the country - with 20 people killed and more than 100 injured in Belgorod, near the border.

The regional governor said three children were among the dead in what was one of the deadliest attacks on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian security source said more than 70 drones had been launched against Russian targets, as a ""response to Russia's terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians"".

Addressing the situation in Belgorod, they blamed the ""incompetent work of Russian air defence"" for civilian casualties - saying this was what caused falling fragments.

Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of being behind drone strikes in recent months. Kyiv rarely admits to such attacks across the border, although it has carried out strikes like this before.","Ukraine war: Russia launches fresh drone assault on Kyiv and Kharkiv, officials sayBy George Wright BBC NewsEPARussia has been striking Kharkiv in recent daysUkraine is again under attack by Russian drones, officials say, after two days of major aerial assaults by both sides.

By Doug Faulkner & Harrison Jones BBC News

PA Media

New year plans for thousands have been thrown into chaos after Eurostar cancelled all its services to and from London St Pancras due to flooding in a tunnel under the River Thames.

Many frustrated passengers are now stranded in London and Paris, scrambling to rearrange New Year's Eve plans and find other travel routes.

Some were facing expensive hotel bills or costly airfares.

Eurostar has not yet said whether services will resume on Sunday.

But HS1, which operates the track, said the problems would ""take time"" to resolve.

A video taken inside the flooded tunnel shows water gushing onto the tracks from a pipe attached to the tunnel's wall.

Thames Water said a ""fire control system"" was likely to have caused the flooding, rather than one of its own pipes.

All Southeastern's high-speed services to Ebbsfleet, which use the same line, were also cancelled.

This video from Southeastern railway shows water gushing from a pipe into the tunnel

Eurostar, which runs services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, said affected customers were entitled to a full refund or exchange.

At a crowded St Pancras on Saturday, disappointed travellers sat on suitcases, frantically trying to find alternative routes.

Christina David, 25, and Georgina Benyamin, 26, from Sydney, saw their train cancelled after travelling around Europe on a budget for three weeks.

They planned to ""go hard"" for their final stop in Paris - where they hoped to celebrate the New Year at an expensive hotel with a view of the Eiffel Tower - before flying home.

Ms Benyamin said she wanted to see Paris ""light up"" but was now feeling frustrated and angry.

""There were lots of people crying,"" said her friend, Ms David. ""We don't know where to go, we have nowhere to stay.""

There were similar stories from across the Channel.

Curt Downs, his wife Megan and their one-year-old son were among hundreds stuck at Paris' Gare Du Nord station, after their train was cancelled.

""Eurostar staff there were completely overwhelmed and couldn't really suggest anything for us,"" he told BBC News.

One staff member told them they had 4,000 passengers to assist, but all flights from Paris and ferries from Calais were sold out, he said.

Mr Downs said the family spent two hours trying to find a way back to the UK, looking for ferries, car hire and flights.

They managed to get some of the last seats on a £450 flight from Paris to Manchester, from where Mrs Downs' mother is doing a five-hour round trip drive to get them home to Bedfordshire.

Before it became clear all services were cancelled, Joshua Parisutham, 31, from Harrow in London, told BBC News that some travellers at St Pancras were offering their tickets to those who were particularly upset or desperate to travel.

And one man was seen wandering around the station clutching an iPad, saying ""taxi to Paris"".

At 17:30 on Saturday, the Port of Dover advised stranded Eurostar travellers that there was no remaining foot passenger availability for the day.

HS1, which operates the track, said engineers had worked through the night to remove water into Saturday morning but the volume of water was ""unprecedented"".

Pumps and tankers are on the site and water levels are reducing, the company added, and apologised for the inconvenience caused.

An HS1 spokesperson added on Saturday evening: ""We are doing everything possible to restore services but this is proving challenging and will take time.""

It is the second time in 10 days there has been major disruption to Eurostar services, with a ""last-minute strike"" by French workers halting trains before Christmas.

Separately, there is major disruption on Thameslink services - which run through London and across south-east England - and a reduced service on Northern Rail, which covers the north of England, due to staff shortages.

In Wales, the line between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog has been closed due to ""severe weather"", while trains between Swansea and Shrewsbury have been cancelled due to flooding.

Speed restrictions are in place on the West Highland Line until 09:00 on Sunday due to the forecast, Network Rail Scotland said. Some flights at Glasgow Airport were also delayed due to snow on the runway.

The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for wind, rain and snow for large parts of the UK, including:

Rain and snow for most of Scotland until midnight

Wind across Wales, the south of England and parts of the East Anglian coast until 03:00 on Sunday

From newborns saved by clean local power to the welcome return of an iconic lizard, our global reporters take stock of their most powerful moments in climate change of 2023.

The change is happening so rapidly that even the time between major climate reports can be measured in tenths of a degree of warming. Between one landmark report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2018 and another in 2023, humans warmed the world by about 0.1C.

Taking stock of climate change can be difficult in a year of such rapid transformation as 2023.

How much have we heated the world? Taking the surface temperature of an entire planet is no easy task. In any given year, variable natural events cause fluctuations in the temperature – such as El Niño and volcanic eruptions. Scientists use modelling to tune out this natural noise to measure the warming that is caused by human activity. In 2022, human-induced warming surpassed 1.25C for the first time. The year 2023 was even hotter. If you take an average over a decade – a measure used in the IPCC's sixth assessment report – the figure for human-induced warming between 2013 and 2022 was 1.14C.

""The current level of warming is 1.25C, and it's warming at a quarter of a degree per decade,"" says Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford in the UK, and a coordinating lead author on the IPCC's 2018 special report on 1.5C warming.

""You don't need a model to know that, if you are that close, we're going to reach 1.5C in around a decade or so at that rate of warming,"" says Allen.

These numbers can feel very abstract at times. What's not abstract is the effects of climate change as it laps at the thresholds of low-lying homes, burns buildings in climate-fuelled wildfires and thaws the permafrost beneath the feet of communities in the far north.

Future Planet's team of climate reporters write from across five continents to describe what they witnessed as the world warmed in 2023.

Mickal Aranha, Quito, Ecuador

In September, Ecuador raised its alert system from yellow to orange in preparation for El Niño. By October, it had arrived.

This year's El Niño has caused Ecuador's most severe drought in 50 years, which has affected production at hydroelectric plants. As a result, my family in Quito and people throughout Ecuador have been experiencing rolling blackouts that may continue into next year. The blackouts last three hours a day between 7am and 6pm, disrupting work, home life, causing traffic chaos, and heightening security problems in the country, which has been plagued by violence in recent years.

The peak of this El Niño still looms. Intense rains are expected between December and February, which have historically led to floods and landslides on the coast and the Western Andes region, causing massive damage to infrastructure like roads and bridges.

This could impact food security, water quality, and health – floods are known to fuel a surge of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue. Farmers and the fishing community, meanwhile, are preparing for the loss of livelihood as floods sweep away their cacao and banana crops and El Niño's warming effect causes fish to migrate.

Ana Ionova, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

In Brazil, the climate crisis felt more real than ever this year. I've covered a steady stream of environmental disasters in recent years, from the razing of the Amazon rainforest to the wildfires in the Pantanal wetlands.

But in 2023, things felt different. It seemed like there was no respite from climate-induced tragedy here; for the first time, it was everywhere, all at once.

A historic drought parched the Amazon rainforest, drying up rivers and stranding people in remote villages with no food, water or medicine. Endangered pink dolphins died from heat stress in lakes, while smoke from wildfires choked whole cities. In southern Brazil, cyclones swept away neighbourhoods, killing dozens.

And in Rio de Janeiro, where I live, the death of a young concert-goer during yet another punishing heat wave put into sharp focus how a rapidly warming climate is changing every aspect of our lives.

Amy Li Baksh, San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago

As a child, visiting nature reserves in the hills of Trinidad and Tobago, I was fascinated with the teeming wildlife. Hummingbirds, bats, agouti, dragonflies – the highlight would be spotting the lumbering Matte lizard, also known as the golden tegu.

But in recent years, the Matte, one of the largest lizards found on our twin islands, has been no longer as easy to spot. To find out why, I spoke to Kemba Jaramogi, whose family developed the Fondes Amandes Community Reforestation Project to fight forest fires, help reforestation, and teach other communities indigenous methods of living with the land.

""A Matte doesn't climb trees,"" says Jaramogi. ""If the ground is continuously burnt, their home is at risk.""

Repeated bushfires this year drove the lizards from their habitat in the leaf litter of the forest. The community project's work has helped the land recover enough that these majestic lizards are now returning to the spaces they once fled. To Jaramogi's excitement, she has recently spotted Mattes returning to the area.

It is just one example of how indigenous and communal knowledge give the Caribbean tools to protect and rehabilitate our home in the face of climate change.

Lucy Sherriff, Los Angeles, United States

When I look over the stories I've written this year, the majority have been about how extreme weather is getting worse in the US, and how the country's response is woefully lacking. I live in LA, and friends of mine haven't gone out some days because the pollution has been so bad – and we didn't even have major wildfires this year.

In December, we've had days that have hit almost 30C (86F). We've celebrated when the rains have come because we're usually in a permanent state of drought. It's a running joke in California that we're always battling something – fire, floods, drought, or bracing ourselves for an earthquake.

The state is grappling with a new normality. And I don't think anyone is ready.

Saidu Bah, Freetown, Sierra Leone

It was eye-opening reporting for Future Planet's Climate Guardians series on the climate threats faced by women living in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

Many of the women living and working in Freetown's sprawling slums and street markets complained about the impact of extreme heat on their wellbeing and ability to work this year.

In previous years, ""we were worried about fire disasters, flooding, mudslides and rising sea levels but now it's the changes in the weather patterns that is troubling us"", Mariama Bangura, a 45-year-old resident of Kroobay slum, told me. ""Extreme heat during the dry season is a silent killer. You can feel the impact without seeing it.""

Ninety-four percent of Freetown's residents say the city was hotter in 2022 than it was five years ago. Women living in slum houses made of heat-trapping corrugated metal sheets are among the most vulnerable to the scorching temperatures.

Freetown has appointed a heat officer, Eugenia Kargbo, to help its residents cope with the temperatures. Her first moves have been installing shade covers to protect market vendors, and reflective roofs on slum dwellings, and planting one million trees across the city – an initiative that was nominated for the prestigious Earth Shot Prize in 2023.

Nalova Akua, Yaounde, Cameroon

Along the 470km (290 miles) of Cameroon's Atlantic Coast, erosion is one of the most pressing environmental concerns. In coastal towns like Bamusso, Ngosso and Kribi, and larger cities like Douala and Limbe, local communities are using sand bags, wooden fences and logs in an attempt to break the waves. The mangrove forests that have helped protect the region in the past are close to being overwhelmed.

""The beach that used to be over 100m [330ft] away from the highway 30 years ago is now threatening the tar on the road,"" says Isaac Njilah Konfor, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Yaoundé, Cameroon, who is researching the impact of sea level rise in the region. ""The waves are becoming bigger and stronger.""

Globally, the causes of coastal erosion are complex, including coastal development, but rising sea levels and storm surges due to climate change can add to the pressure.

Erika Benke, Lapland, Finland

While reporting in Lapland, I met Anna Morottaja, a fisherwoman and musician living in Inari, northern Finland. She says she has seen new species of birds and insects appearing in Lapland in recent years.

""I never saw greenfinches and blue tits in my childhood,"" she says. ""They were common in central Finland, 800-900km (497-559 miles) to the south. Now they're here. Some came 10 years ago, some a year ago.""

Riikka Morottaja

Like most people living in Lapland, Morottaja uses a lot of firewood to heat her house and sauna. She chops up wood and stacks it in the yard in the winter, leaving the pile to dry by the end of the summer.

But she says the air has become a lot more humid and firewood now doesn't dry properly in the warmer months.

""When you make a fire, there's a lot of smoke and sizzle. Wood also gets mouldy when you put it in a pile,"" she says. ""I used to store a small amount of firewood in the house but I have stopped doing it now: I don't want to introduce mould in the air that I breathe in.""

To tackle the problem, Morottaja tells me that has had to build a new shelter with a roof to better protect her firewood from humidity. ""Now we have a longer cycle. It takes two years rather than just one to dry firewood. So I need two shelters for wood. One is not enough.""

Watch: Home to majestic houseboats and floating gardens, this pristine beauty of Kashmir is on the verge of extinction.

Vandana K, Meghalaya, India

On a very rainy day, staff at the Mawtawar health clinic in Meghalaya in north-eastern India delivered a baby who couldn't breathe, move or cry. In a state where high demand is placed on too little hydroelectric power and power cuts are frequent, this might have been a hopeless situation for the young family.

But the health clinic staff used an oxygen concentrator powered by solar panels to increase the baby's oxygen levels in less than an hour. The baby now visits the clinic regularly with his mother to get immunised.

Health workers Bandashisha Diengdoh and Eva Kordor Marngar told me about the difference the recently installed solar panels have made to local healthcare, when I visited in September.

Now, a growing number of the state's 643 health facilities to solar power, after an effort by the government and the non-profit Selco Foundation that began in 2020. As I saw in Meghalaya, the switch to local, renewable sources of energy is already saving lives.

Kanika Gupta, Ladakh, India

Seventy-year-old Kungaga Norphel has seen a lot change in Ladakh in his lifetime. Norphel, who lives in Nang, a village in Ladakh in the Himalayas, says it doesn't rain or snow when it's supposed to anymore.

""There was very little snow this year,"" he told me when I visited in late November. ""You can see yourself."" As little as seven to 10 years ago, it would have snowed by now and the streams would be frozen, he says. ""But this year, they are still flowing.""

Norphel says the community has started collecting water from local ponds to make up for the lack of precipitation.

""We have four ponds in our village. Every year our village leader nominates four people who take turns to go up to the pond and fill it up with water from the nearby streams. After 6pm these men close the drain outlet in the pond so that it can fill up overnight. Then in the morning they make another trip to the pond to release the water. This water is enough for us to irrigate our fields,"" he says.

However, this method also poses risks, Norphel says. ""Sometimes when it rains, we also have to go to [drain] the pond in the middle of the night to ensure that it doesn't overflow and flood the village.""

Ringzen Wangyal, a local resident in Nang village, agrees that Ladakh has changed a lot over the years. ""There are apples and apricots in the summer that we had never seen before,"" Wangyal says. The lack of rainfall means farmers now rely on water provided by the government to grow these crops.

Xiaoying You, Huizhou, China

I filed nearly 60 climate reports in 2023, and my most memorable exchanges were with Yu Kongjian, a leading Chinese landscape architect.

Yu, who narrowly avoided getting swept away by floods as a boy by grabbing onto a willow tree branch, is a big supporter of using nature-based solutions to tackle urban flooding, which has become more frequent in China. He is the innovator behind the ""sponge city"" concept, which proposes that nature can act as a giant sponge to absorb flood water and channel it under the ground.

He also often looks to the past for inspiration. We need to ""think globally but act locally,"" he told me earlier this year, pointing to the historic city of Huizhou in eastern China as an example. Here, every family used to manage rainwater by collecting and redirecting it. Huizhou is a home to plenty of sustainability solutions from the past besides, including ancient skywells that help keep homes cool.

As the world races to keep below the 1.5C threshold of warming, this year I've been thinking about the benefits of pausing to think about what we can learn from our past, simpler lifestyles.

Strikes swept the globe in industries including automotive, transport, healthcare and more (Credit: Alamy)

AI, return-to-office, the summer of strikes and more: both labourers and employers found themselves working through a rollercoaster of changes this year.

The work world has been a moving target for a while now. In 2023, some of the unresolved issues of the past three years settled, especially around the return to office. Yet evolving technology and a surge in organised labour meant plenty of new themes cropped up. They combined for a year of work unlike any other.

AI began its inevitable rise

The launch of ChatGPT on 30 November

2022 set the stage for a tidal wave of workplace changes in 2023. The impact of artificial intelligence on the labour force ­– and the future of work as we know it – was perhaps the most high profile topic of the year. And for good reason.

Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers. Recruiters began to see job applicants sending in materials written with ChatGPT; workers began to integrate the technology into their daily jobs – depending on it to the point that they found ways to secretly access the tools if they were banned.

One of the most ubiquitous worries – even existential concerns – among workers was whether AI would come for their jobs, especially as 2023 data from firms including Goldman Sachs and McKinsey and Company indicated replacement-by-robot may be imminent for many people.

The answer is still murky. Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service. Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.

It's not quite time to panic, though. First, many experts say there are jobs that will be difficult to automate outright – especially roles that require a human touch, sophisticated interpersonal relationships or out-of-the-box thinking.

And for positions that might be more vulnerable, experts also predict AI will end up as a supplementary technology, instead of an outright mechanism for replacement. At this point, AI is largely automating rote, repetitive tasks that can be a time-suck for workers, and could free up employees to do higher-level, more creative tasks. It also could push them to upskill, which may have long-term benefits.

At this point, experts recommend workers embrace AI, rather than fear it. The more people can understand the technology – both what it can and can't do – the more they'll be poised to work with it in ways that can advance them, and help them stay valuable to their employers.

Return-to-office became a reality

For many workers, the days of resisting return-to-office policies are over. After nearly three years of push-and-pull between employees and bosses, millions of workers are back in offices, at least partially – whether or not they want to be.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow.

While many companies have stuck with hybrid set-ups, others, such as Goldman Sachs and Disney, have leaned hard into this newfound power, recalling their employees four-to-five days per week. Others, including Amazon, have threatened workers who ignore these mandates – either denying them the opportunity to advance, or moving to terminate their employment entirely. Many companies who haven't fully returned yet have plans to do so in 2024.

If the switch seems jarring, it is. Since some offices began reopening in early 2021, workers have largely been able to make their own rules about whether they come in or not, despite years of heavy-handed pushes from leaders. Yet as job opportunities have tightened, it's far more difficult to snub these directives, since the Great Resignation is ""over"", and most workers can't easily hop into another job. And even for the new roles that are popping up, just a small percentage offer a fully remote set-up.

Yet experts are important to caveat that workers haven't entirely lost, even if they're back into their daily commute a few times a week.

The mainstreaming of hybrid set-ups means workers still have unprecedented flexibility and are unlikely to lose it entirely. Kastle Systems, which tracks employee access-card swipes for many businesses, has shown office attendance in 2023 is still a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic. Going forward, many jobs will have a hybrid schedule – a privilege formerly afforded to a select few, mostly senior employees.

Labour found its voice

""Summer of strikes"", ""hot labour summer"" – whatever the name, workers made their voices heard in 2023. Across the world, millions of people throughout many sectors organised, looking for better conditions and wages as well as career security for the future.

In the UK and US, healthcare workers conducted high-profile strikes after years of pandemic-era burnout and understaffing. Workers in transport, education and service joined them in the hundreds of thousands. But two US-based strikes particularly captured attention on the global stage.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow

On 2 May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), representing more than 10,000 screenwriters, hit the picket line over issues including pay in the era of streaming-media dominance, and future protections against evolving AI technology. The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) also went on strike on 14 July, with the two powerful unions standing in solidarity over shared concerns.

Then, on 14 September, workers at the three largest automakers in the country – GM, Ford and Stellantis – walked off the job. The members of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) were not only looking for pay increases from the executives that make millions, but also seeking to secure their jobs in an industry that is increasingly moving towards EVs.

These disputes finally settled in the autumn, with all unions securing unprecedented gains, especially around wage boosts and job-futureproofing.

Experts say moments like this may be poised to continue. Not only have the successes of these labour movements inspired and empowered workers, but data also shows Gen Z is highly supportive of organised labour. As the next generation become a larger part of the workforce, they are likely to lead more pro-union pushes.

Work perks, redefined

Throughout the past few years, perks like ping-pong tables and kombucha on tap have faded as must-haves for worker satisfaction. The pandemic transformed what workers wanted from their employers, including new wellness benefits, or flexibility to work where and when they wished. Employers have largely listened – if not magnanimously, then at least out of the desire to attract and retain talent.

This year, perks have evolved even more, as workers across the globe have settled into their post-pandemic lives. Employers have begun to modernise their benefits suites as workers settled flexible work patterns, prioritised work-life balance and found themselves with different responsibilities at home.

Some companies are hoping to make jobs more fun, offering their workers multi-thousand-dollar travel stipends to unplug, or even doling out spot bonuses in the form of points redeemable for goods and services. Others are looking at things more tactically, offering perks such as pet-friendly offices and spaces for childcare – even donations to charity for each day in the office ­– to incentivise workers back to their desks.

Perhaps this year's most notable shift, however, is the expansion of perks catering to an oft-overlooked group of workers: Gen X. An increasing number of employers are integrating benefits that help this ""sandwich generation"" – often caring for children and ageing parents at once – live life a healthier, more balanced life. Some of these new offerings include menopause support, healthcare screenings, eldercare and even ""gran-ternity leave"".

Experts say these benefits are a direct way to address worker happiness, and can pay off for employers, too; firms can become more appealing employers for older workers, who are often of leadership age. It's often a good deal for both parties.

Living on #worktok

Work culture found its way onto social media in a big way this year with #worktok. Creators across many platforms – particularly TikTok – invited users to get ready with them for their workdays, and toured them through their offices and daily grinds, often amassing millions of views. Sometimes they complained about their employers, and even quit on livestreams (accordingly, #quittok).

Perhaps most notable were the commentaries on work culture that came from this social media moment. The ""lazy girl job"", coined in May by 26-year-old Gabrielle Judge, particularly resonated with a group of workers who want to clock fewer hours and do less work (who wouldn't?). Her videos racked up hundreds of hundreds of thousands of views, and launched a tag with millions of impressions.

The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts. This is especially true as work and life increasingly bleed into each other, and young people in particular have not had the formative workplace interactions to build real world relationships.

""If you're working from home, you don't have that water cooler moment. Maybe if you come into a job during the pandemic, you might not have workmates who you're super close with,"" says Sara McCorquodale, the founder of UK-based influencer intelligence business CORQ. Along with creating community, she says, #WorkTok enables people to put a voice to one of the most important facets of their lives. It won't stop anytime soon.

It's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce

Workers stayed put – but checked out

The Great Resignation defined the past few years in the workplace. It was a sign of worker empowerment; since 2020, millions of employees – especially in the US – left their jobs for new ones that made them happier, were more aligned with their values or improved the overall quality of their lives.

Yet as the labour market tightened this year amid mass layoffs and an uncertain economy, mid-2023 data began to show the turnover rate for US employees had normalised to pre-pandemic levels. The shift was so significant, that in August, economists declared the Great Resignation's finale.

For workers, this marked the end of an era in job mobility. And that's bred another problem: it's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce.

Subsequently, employees are leaning out of their work. Think the ""quiet quitting"" trend of 2022, at the next level.

In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work. This mentality doesn't only lead to pesky dissatisfaction – it can also contribute to lower levels of personal wellbeing, says Jim Harter, chief scientist for workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup.

This leaves workers in a bad place, of course, but companies also stand to suffer, since productivity and morale falls off a cliff with disengagement. So, as workers check out, experts say it's up to leaders to light their employees' fires again. That means investing in their careers, supporting them with the same earnestness they did during the pandemic and working on building culture.

It may be tempting for employers to sit back if they're not fearful their employees will leave – but such a decision stands to hurt everyone.

A serious look at four-day workweeks

Four-day workweek trials kicked off in 2022, and spread across the globe in 2023, both in public and private sectors. In many cases, they have been successful; after the large-scale UK four-day workweek pilot from February, 92% of participating employers said they would continue with a shorter workweek following the programme. Nearly a third made the change permanent.

Workers have reported lower burnout and stress, and relished the time off. Companies have loved seeing their workers happier and more engaged, which has led to sustained productivity and employee retention. More companies are giving the four-day workweek a go, with others codifying the set-up in the coming months. Some firms are also giving the format a try with the hope that a shorter week may lure workers back into the office.

Are 32-hour workweeks imminent for all workers? As positive as the results have been – and even as more firms jump in –­ probably not.

For instance, not every company that's tried it has declared the experiment a resounding success; some leaders found cramming five days of work into four was stressful for employees, and sometimes failed customers. Other firms simply may not be set up to ever implement the change – whether due to the nature of their businesses, or because it's not a cultural fit.","Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers.
Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service.
Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.
The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts.
In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work."

Discover Baku's history through its unique architecture (Credit: Jon Arnold Images Ltd/Alamy)

Lying at the crossroads of East and West, Azerbaijan's capital reveals its Zoroastrian, Islamic and Soviet past – and it's oil-rich present – through its unique design.

Space and time appear to intersect in Baku. If you climb up to Highland Park and look down over the bustling city, you'll notice how different epochs have contributed to the dense urban fabric of Azerbaijan's capital. From the city's medieval sandstone nucleus to the glass skyscrapers of its most recent oil boom, Baku reveals its long history at the crossroads of East and West through its architecture.

Cultural guide and architectural researcher Gani Nasirov has been studying Baku's design for years, analysing the subtle details that distinguish its Zoroastrian roots from its Islamic core, and its Soviet past from its modern European influences.

""Baku's architectural heritage is incredibly diverse. You can find buildings that draw inspiration from classical Greek and Roman shapes and others that exhibit Art Nouveau elements. Then there are grand Soviet socialist structures, which often incorporate Islamic and Oriental aesthetics,"" Nasirov said.

As Baku continues to renew itself, it has become a beacon for architecture buffs. From its historical monuments to its glittering modern marvels, here are the eight structures that Nasirov says best tell the city's story.

1. Palace of the Shirvanshahs

Archaeological evidence shows there were prehistoric human settlements near Baku, but the exact date of the capital's founding remains uncertain. As Nasirov explained, we know that Baku experienced significant growth in the Middle Ages when the rulers of the Shirvan state (which occupied the north-eastern regions of modern-day Azerbaijan) relocated to the city. ""Up to the 12th Century, the Shirvanshahs' residence was in the city of Shamaki, 120km west of Baku,"" said Nasirov. ""The city was frequently struck by devastating earthquakes and, as a result, [the Shah] Shirvanshah Manuchohr III (1120-1149) ordered the construction of a formidable fortress wall around the hill overlooking Baku Bay.""

This fortress wall is still a prominent feature of the Unesco-inscribed old town, enclosing a labyrinthine network of narrow alleys connecting mosques, caravanserais, hammams, restaurants and hotels. ""Baku's importance solidified in the 15th Century. It was at this time the rulers completed the striking Palace of the Shirvanshahs, an outstanding example of medieval architecture,"" said Nasirov.

The palace complex (now a museum) contained 52 rooms, the Shirvanshahs' tombs, a mosque and the octagonal royal court. Around it, the city expanded. ""The fortress city was meticulously planned, following the principles of the Oriental quarters known as mahallas,"" Nasirov said. ""Each mahalla was organised around a bazaar square, which served as the commercial centre and featured a mosque, baths and residential houses. As a result, the architectural layout of [the Old City] remains characterised by its intricate maze-like streets and flat-roofed houses.""

2. Maiden's Tower (Qız Qalası)

One of Baku's most iconic sites, the cylindrical Maiden's Tower soars above the Old City walls. Despite its location, its origins remain a mystery, which has fuelled quite a few myths. As Nasirov explained: ""Scholars have been unable to provide definitive answers to questions regarding its construction date and original purpose. The enigma has inspired poems, cartoons and even an opera ballet, making it a symbol of the city.""

The SpeciaList Gani Nasirov is a Baku-based tour guide and writer who specialises in the city's architecture, history and heritage.

Some researchers believe that the original structure could have been a pre-Islamic Zoroastrian temple that was converted into a defensive tower in the 12th Century, but varying legends persist. ""Myths often revolve around the name 'maiden',"" said Nasirov. ""The best-known tale tells of a young girl that had the tower built to protect herself against an unwanted suitor. Unable to escape, she committed suicide by jumping from the top of the tower into the Caspian Sea. This legend has deeply permeated popular culture and has become a recurring theme in the works of Azerbaijani artists and poets.""

3. Taza Pir Mosque

Shia Islam became the dominant religion in Azerbaijan in the Middle Ages, and it remains so today. ""Historically, the city's religious landscape was diverse: Christianity, Judaism and Islam, as well as mystical Sufi movements such as Hurufism and Khalwatiyya were all represented,"" Nasirov said. ""Islam grew to become the dominant faith, but most mosques during the Middle Ages followed the traditions of vernacular architecture, featuring relatively small box-shaped structures. It wasn't until the early 20th Century, with the wealth of new oil barons, [that there was] the construction of grandiose mosques.""

One such project was the Taza Pir Mosque, which was built in 1914 and replaced an old religious tomb. As Nasirov explained: ""The Taza Pir Mosque stands as a remarkable architectural achievement in Baku, representing a new era in mosque design. It draws inspiration from architectural styles across the broader Muslim East, marking a fresh chapter in the evolution of religious architecture in Baku. The exterior of the mosque features porticos and two minarets rising from the sides, while the square worship hall [is] enhanced by grand domes. The interior decorations incorporate elements derived from local architectural traditions, creating a unique and aesthetically rich space.""

""The expansion of Baku beyond its historic 12th-Century fortress walls was closely linked to the development of the modern oil industry, which propelled Baku to become a global hub of oil production by 1901,"" said Nasirov, noting that this late-19th-Century oil boom radically transformed the city. Beyond mosques, architects erected grandiose European-inspired palaces and public buildings to show off the city's new wealth.

According to Nasirov, prominent European families and oil conglomerates played a crucial role in revolutionising Baku's oil industry. But there were also local entrepreneurs, some of whom became millionaires almost overnight. The best-known rags-to-riches story is that of Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, whose statue stands outside the Icherisheher metro station. Taghiyev commissioned an eclectic mansion as a residence (now a museum), but was also dedicated to philanthropic enterprises, funding the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre and Baku's first boarding school for girls, now the Institute of Manuscripts.

""The oil barons played a key role as sponsors of [Baku's] architectural transformation of the early 20th Century, hiring European architects to design their eclectic dreams. Besides Taghiyev's private mansion designed by Polish architect Iosif Goslavsky, notable examples include the Ismailiyya Palace (housing the Muslim Philanthropic Society) designed by Iosif Ploshko, and the Philharmonic Hall designed by Gabriel Ter-Mikelov. These architectural landmarks combine features of Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau, Baroque, Moorish and other styles, showcasing the diverse influences that shaped the city's architectural landscape during the oil-boom era.""

5. Government House

When Azerbaijan became part of the USSR in 1922, Baku's grandiose palaces began being replaced by a different collection of Soviet structures. ""The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent invasion of Baku by the Red Army in 1920 had a profound impact on the economic and socio-political system of the city. This marked the beginning of Baku's expansion and growth driven by socialist ideology throughout the 20th Century,"" Nasirov said.

""In the mid-1930s, Boris Iofan's design for the Palace of the Soviets gained official approval, leading the way for the dominance of Stalinist architecture in the city. Under Stalin's rule, architects adopted classical ornaments and grand archways reminiscent of Greco-Roman temples, combining them with elements of the Islamic tradition typical of Azerbaijani culture to obtain a style that was national in form and socialist in essence.""

A hammer and sickle still looms over the entrance of the monumental, U-shaped Palace of the Soviets (now the Government House), which was completed in 1952, just a year before Stalin's death.

6. Mirvari Cafe

Various architectural styles followed in Baku during the seven decades of the USSR's existence. ""Constructivism emerged in the 1920s, reflecting the revolutionary spirit of the era. It was overtaken in the 1930s by a return to classicism of Stalinist architecture, which lasted until Stalin's death. The Khrushchev era witnessed the rise of Soviet Modernism, which continued until the fall of the Soviet Union,"" Nasirov explained.

Soviet modernist architecture had an unquestionable utilitarian drive, but experimentation persisted too. ""Massive and austere buildings resembling [giant] matchboxes dominated the architectural landscape of Baku after 1955. New residential blocks known as microraions were constructed with functionality in mind to address housing issues in the post-war Soviet Union. But avant-garde administrative offices, sports complexes, concert halls and public buildings were built as well.""

Important projects such as the Baku metro system were completed during this period, but more subtle buildings are perhaps better examples of the epoch's ideals. ""Cafe Pearl (now Mirvari Cafe), located on the promenade, was a popular spot for Baku residents to enjoy views of the Baku Bay on hot summer days,"" Nasirov said. The cafe, completed in 1959, still stands as a shining example of Soviet Modernism. While it's one of Baku's lesser-known architectural monuments today, when it was built, Nasirov said it ""became a showpiece meant to fuel the architectural rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States"".

7. Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ushered in a new era of urban planning, ignited by the 1994 ""contract of the century"" between Azerbaijan's government and multinational oil corporations, that granted foreign investors the right to exploit Azerbaijan's natural resources. The completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline in 2006 made Baku a major oil exporter. Much of the profits produced by the oil industry were invested in the modernisation of the city, adding a series of futuristic buildings to the skyline.

""The Flame Towers, located on the city's highest point near Highland Park, serve as an architectural landmark that reflect Azerbaijan's oil heritage while projecting a forward-looking identity,"" Nasirov said. ""The most famous example of contemporary architecture, however, is the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre designed by Zaha Hadid."" The seemingly fluid whitewashed structure, which takes its name from former president Heydar Aliyev, won the 2014 Design of the Year Award and has become one of the new symbols of the city, housing an exhibition hall and a museum dedicated to Aliyev's achievements.

The soon-to-be-completed Crescent Bay development project will feature a bow-shaped, 32-storey luxury hotel, reflecting its silhouette on the waters of the Caspian Sea. ""[It] takes inspiration from the crescent moon symbol that is ever-present in Azerbaijani culture, including on the national flag,"" Nasirov said. Looking ahead, these projects will continue to showcase Baku's architectural prowess and contribute to its ongoing architectural journey.""

By Norman Miller Features correspondent

Crime thriller, disturbing fantasy, or folk horror – the 1973 cult hit The Wicker Man refuses categorisation.

For a low-budget film that its own studio head reportedly described as one of the worst they had ever seen, The Wicker Man has done pretty well. Fifty years after being quietly slipped out in a limited release UK double bill (with Don't Look Now) in December 1973, it is hailed among the most influential films of all time. ""It changed music, art and film,"" wrote British Film Institute (BFI) curator William Fowler in a 2013 appreciation Why I Love The Wicker Man.

The Wicker Man has had a unique cultural influence. Its soundtrack, for example, helped spark a new musical genre – often labelled psych folk – while inspiring homages from a host of contemporary acts. These include Pulp's 2001 Wickerman, Sneaker Pimp's 1996 How Do (Willow's Song), and Radiohead's 2016 Burn The Witch. In 2021, Fire Leap by the cutting-edge electronic music maker Gazelle Twin and NYX offered a drone choir riff on one memorable scene.

To mark the approach of the film's 50th anniversary, London's Barbican Centre staged a special concert in June 2023 featuring a contemporary ""interpretation"" of the soundtrack along with a new suite of folk songs inspired by it. This month, meanwhile, saw the BBC broadcast the world premiere of a radio adaptation of the film.

Costumed fans now gather for quirky singalong screenings – while a 2018 UK screening still prompted protests from Christians. This didn't stop the film featuring in the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics as part of a tribute to British cinema. And for a film whose genesis was full of twists and turns, it's appropriate that 2018 saw a Wicker Man rollercoaster ride opened at the Alton Towers theme park.

Origins of a masterpiece

The Wicker Man's roots lay in a little-known 1967 novel by British actor and author David Pinner called Ritual, whose film rights were purchased in 1971 by legendary veteran British horror film actor Christopher Lee. He also starred as Lord Summerisle, later proclaiming it the best film he'd ever made. With Lee on board, the production acquired writer Anthony Shaffer – fresh from the films Sleuth and Frenzy – to provide a screenplay.

However, the studio behind the film – British Lion – was in upheaval at the time, with financial woes and changes at the top. The UK was also riven with industrial unrest, and one reason The Wicker Man may have been given the go ahead was simply to provide production jobs.

Shot over a few weeks in 1972 by first-time director Robin Hardy in the glorious Scottish border region of Galloway, The Wicker Man is a leftfield low-budget yarn involving a straitlaced God-fearing policeman (Sergeant Howie, played by Edward Woodward) sent to investigate the apparent disappearance of a young girl in the remote community of Summerisle.

Howie becomes increasingly unsettled by the rituals, passions and startling sights that envelop him here – pickled foreskins in the pharmacist, orgies on the village green – but battles on with his investigation, suspecting the missing girl has been murdered. Her ""disappearance"" is finally revealed as a trick to bring him to the island. The finale sees Howie trapped – while dressed as the violent ""Fool"" figure Punch – then burned to death inside a towering wicker man figure as a human sacrifice to pagan harvest gods.

Beyond definition

Though initially marketed as ""horror"", The Wicker Man is a film that truly resists categorisation. Until the finale, there are none of the frights that define genre horror – in fact, the residents of Summerisle seem blissfully content with their ways, throwing negative judgements back on an audience trying to work out the significance of what is on the screen. ""Very few horror films actually have that quality of presenting a plausible reality,"" argues Gill Jamieson, senior lecturer in Film, Television and Cultural Studies at the University of the West of Scotland.

At different times and from different perspectives, it can feel as though you're watching a crime thriller, a fantasy, a celebration of alternate lifestyles or nature-centred folklore – or brilliantly conceived arthouse cinema. In the 2008 book Fifty Key British Films, Justin Smith considered The Wicker Man ""a curious mixture of detective story and folk musical"".

The Wicker Man can also be watched as a challenge to orthodox religion – not least when Lord Summerisle defends his pagan ethos by wryly questioning Howie's Christian worship of ""the son of a virgin impregnated by a ghost"". Or perhaps it's the first mockumentary in British cinema history, given an opening credit offering thanks to Summerisle residents ""for this privileged insight into their religious practices and for their generous cooperation in the making of this film"".

""The Wicker Man is many things,"" says David Bramwell, who created the Sing-a-long-a-Wicker Man film nights in 2009, and claims to have seen the film more than 150 times. ""I think sometimes a film surprises us – films that manifest and we don't really know where they're from,"" he said. ""They seem out of place and time, and hold up because they're not referencing anything around them.""

It's a film that plays with audience sympathies, too. ""The first time you watch The Wicker Man you can identify with Howie's plight because we've all been in situations we don't understand, we don't have control over,"" says Jamieson. ""But it rewards repeat viewing, too, because once we know the answer to the enigma, we can go back and take pleasure in looking for all the moves on the board.""

Afterlife of a masterpiece

One of the most remarkable aspects of The Wicker Man is the soundtrack, whose beautifully skewed folk songs sound ancient despite being composed on the spot by Paul Giovanni, a US writer and actor who had limited knowledge of British folk music.

Adding to the film's mythology is the lack of any recording of its magical soundtrack for many years. In fact, the whole film languished in relative obscurity for well over a decade after its release. That changed in 1988, when a late-night BBC arts series called Moviedrome began its mission to spotlight interesting cult films with a programme that was followed by the first British TV showing of The Wicker Man.

The music manages to tap into the psyche and lyricism of the atmospheric Scottish setting

As part of the surge of interest that followed, film music collector Johnny Trunk set about trying to find a recording of The Wicker Man soundtrack for public release. The problem was that nobody knew where one was. After several years' search, Trunk was given permission to look through the vaults at Pinewood Studios, where he located a cache of reel-to-reel tapes containing the film's sound effects – as well as the all-important music. But what has made this music carry on resonating?

As a musician familiar with places the film was shot, Eliza Skelton (co-creator of the Sing-a-long-a-Wicker-Man nights with David Bramwell) believes the music manages to tap into ""the psyche and lyricism"" of the atmospheric Scottish setting. ""The songs also lend themselves to lots of arrangements – but still in the folk tradition.""

She is echoed by Katy J Pearson, whose 2023 Wicker Man album seamlessly mixes trippy club remixes with classic takes on the soundtrack songs. ""Paul Giovanni and Gary Carpenter created something timeless – and unique for the time,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""They managed to merge a lot of old traditional folk songs and poems into an exciting piece of work that could easily fit in with the new alt-folk scene happening today.""

British festival culture has also been shaped by the film. A Wicker Man Festival ran every summer in Galloway from 2001 until the death of its organiser in 2015, earning comparisons with the Burning Man event in the US. The popular Green Man festival in Wales still culminates with the burning of a giant wicker figure each year, while New Age travellers have regularly burned similar figures at Glastonbury – where the film was part of the festival's official 2023 programme.

Other factors have added to the film's mystique. It has, for example, seemed close to vanishing from existence at various points. A 2013 feature in the LA Times recounted how the original camera negative and out-takes were accidentally destroyed decades ago, and told the story of how the most complete version of the film then in existence was discovered by chance buried in the Harvard Film Archive. This 92-minute 35mm print, made for 1970s US distribution, formed the basis for director Robin Hardy to produce a ""Director's Cut"" in his 80s, three years before his death.

Not bad for a low-budget leftfield film released 50 years ago with minimal expectations. Yet like all great art works, its unique vision shone through. ""It's about something alien and yet close by,"" wrote William Fowler in his 2013 BFI appreciation. ""It never gets tired.""

When you think of cork, you might think of that pop of champagne on New Year's Eve – but some of this versatile tree bark will also be keeping astronauts safe as humanity returns to the Moon.

The space age has brought the world many cutting-edge gadgets and innovative new materials – from super-strong alloys and memory foam to freeze dried foods and the sensors in your mobile phone camera. Advanced technologies such as these have helped Nasa and its fellow space agencies push ever further into the vastness of outer space. So, it might be something of a surprise to see the next era of space exploration relying on a much humbler substance as humans aim to return to the Moon and even beyond to Mars – cork.

This ancient material – which is harvested from the bark of trees that grow around the Mediterranean – is probably most familiar as stoppers in wine and champagne bottles. But its extraordinary properties has seen it used in crucial bits of space rocket hardware and it could come to play an even greater role in years to come.

The world is currently witnessing an ""exponential"" growth in space travel as commercial space companies make firing satellites, spacecraft and even people into orbit ever cheaper. But rocket launches can take a considerable toll on the environment, so scientists and space agencies are hoping to find ways of making space flight more sustainable. Many are looking to natural materials as a way of minimising their impact on the Earth and beyond.

But are trees really up to the extremes of space? And what does sustainability actually mean to the aerospace industry?

Materials that can withstand the extremes of space travel must be able to multitask. They need to be lightweight but also super strong, temperature and radiation resistant – and even capable of transforming in response to their environment. That's why researchers are experimenting with emerging materials with unusual properties. But they are also reverting to some that have been used by humans for thousands of years.

How is cork harvested? The cork oak tree is an unusual crop – it can be ""harvested"" without cutting it down as only the outer bark is removed. A cork oak tree can live for up to 200 years and be harvested around 16 times during its lifetime, without causing lasting damage to the tree. This means the trees can live out their full lives, serving as long-lasting carbon sinks. Cork forests have also been found to prevent desertification and provide habitat for a huge number of animal and plant species, boosting biodiversity. (Read more about why cork is making a comeback in this feature by Alistair Leithhead.)

""The cork forest is a unique ecosystem,"" says Antonio Rios Amorim, chief executive of Portuguese cork producers Corticeira Amorim. ""It is one of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots. It contributes to climate regulation, is a driving force for sustainable development and plays a crucial role in the world's ecological balance.""

Corticeira Amorim has been producing cork for more than 150 years, and has been supplying the aerospace industry since the 1960s.

""70% of the cellular structure of cork is air,"" says Amorim. ""For every cubic centimetre you have 40 million cells. This means it's a very light material, and it has extremely strong cell walls. This makes it a very good insulator."" Cork, he adds, can withstand extreme temperature changes. ""This is not done by us, this is a gift from nature.""

The third Artemis mission will see the SLS launch astronauts in Nasa's Orion spacecraft on the first ever mission to the Moon's South Pole. Without sufficient insulation, the rocket's structural integrity would be compromised – and those astronauts' lives would be at risk.

Michael Alldredge is a materials engineer at Nasa. His job is to select the materials that will go into the thermal protection systems applied to the Moon rocket hardware. These will be crucial to ""maintain structural temperatures during the ascent and operation of the vehicle"", he says.

He watched the launch of Artemis I in November 2022 and says it was hard to process that, after years of work, it was finally leaving the launchpad. But with Artemis II in November 2024, then Artemis III in 2025 the stakes will be much, much higher – when humans will be on board.

""Everybody's got to stay calm and cool because, you know, we're still on console, watching the rocket, watching the performance,"" he says. ""But we'll be trying to hold back the giddiness that comes with watching this mammoth vehicle just rip off the pad – all that power and thrust and force. It's breathtaking.""

Watch: Is cork the Earth's most versatile material?

Currently planned for 2025, the mission will be the first time humanity will set foot on the lunar surface in more than 50 years. Four astronauts will depart from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, sitting on top of Nasa's SLS – the only rocket powerful enough to send Orion, its crew and their supplies to the Moon in a single launch.

Prior to the flight, there will be one final test of the insulation – when all four RS-25 engines will be fired up, the foam and cork will be guarding the hardware ""as hot and cold collide"".

""Down at the base of the vehicle it gets very hot during ascent,"" says Alldredge. ""You've got the engines burning, and you have a lot of heat coming off the engines and the solid rocket boosters on the sides. So, we needed a material that was strong enough to deal with the heat loads at the base of the vehicle, and one that would ablate.""

During ablation, explains Alldredge, some of the material on the outside of the vehicle burns up, taking the heat with it, allowing the underlying vehicle structure to remain cool.

But is sustainability top of Nasa's agenda when it comes to choosing the materials for its rockets? Not in terms of environmental impact, says Alldredge, but in the sense of reliable, long-term availability.

""Sustainability is not necessarily something that we seek from the outset,"" he says. ""We look for what materials would work. Which ones can we get? Which ones are readily available? Which will be hard or expensive to get in the future? When you've got systems as complex as we deal with, the more things you can hold constant, the better.""

The UK Space Agency (UKSA), on the other hand, says it is taking steps towards reducing its environmental impact, with plans to use recycled materials – including cork – to insulate their launcher propulsion systems.

""We are focusing on environmental as well as economical sustainability,"" says Mauro Augelli, launch systems lead and engineer at UKSA. ""It's about respect for the for the planet, and respect for the resources.""

However, he adds, natural materials – which he defines as materials with minimal processing such as cork – can be unpredictable.

You might also like:

""If you don't process them very much, you can have uncertainties about the behaviour,"" he says. ""Plus, when you consider exploration or life support for astronauts, biomaterials can catch fire, they have permeability. These are not qualities you want to have, for example, if you are creating a Moon base.""

UKSA are currently assessing the lifecycles of the materials they use. The preference, he says, should go to materials with a lower environmental impact for the overall lifecycle.

""It's a trade-off between the objectives of the mission and [sustainability]. When we talk about lifecycle assessments, natural materials are better than other materials,"" he says.

However, he adds, UKSA are also exploring materials such as polymers which, when recycled, can be combined with other materials for use in thermal protection.

For now, however, trees are not only going to continue being important for life here on Earth, some are also destined for the stars.

By Meredith Turits Features correspondent @meredithturits

Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come.

February: TikTok bans go global

Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly.

In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.

In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions.

In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections.

March and May: Three US banks fail

The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"".

By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future.

May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America

Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape.

Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing.

The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter.

Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis.

The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.

May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap

There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap.

It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom.

July: Twitter becomes X

In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next.

Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.

Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.

Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content.

September: Rupert Murdoch steps down

After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair.

In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's.

October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial

Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.

Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.

One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more.

October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard

Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.

In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal.

November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection

Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning.

Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand.

December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court

At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward.

If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024.","Ten major events that shaped business in 2023By Meredith Turits Features correspondent @meredithturitsAlamySam Bankman-Fried's fall cast a shadow over crypto's legitimacy and future (Credit: Alamy)Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

By Michelle Tchea Features correspondent

During the Christmas and New Year's holidays, cheese fondue is forgotten as Swiss families instead opt for fondue Chinoise, a fragrant hot pot of broth for dipping tender cuts of meat.

While Italian-Americans may celebrate the holiday season with the feast of the seven fishes and the Swedes spread the festive table with seafood to make their julebord (Christmas Smorgasbord), the Swiss gather around a fondue pot in an activity of unity and friendship. However, it's not the cheese fondue you might expect – instead, they celebrate the end of the year by preparing fondue Chinoise (Chinese fondue), an Asian-inspired hot pot made with a fragrant, salty broth in lieu of cheese, and tender, melt-in-your-mouth ribeye steak for dipping, instead of bread.

Dating to the 17th Century, the history of cheese fondue, unlike fondue Chinoise, has been well-documented. It originated in western Switzerland, where farmers made hard cheese from a surplus of milk during the winter and it was ultimately eaten in the most delicious way possible: melted in a pot.

As food historian Peter Moser reported for the National Museum of Switzerland, fondue has had a place at the Swiss table since the 19th Century, when it shifted from a shepherd's dish to a household staple, and it continues to remain a winter tradition. But during the holidays, the Swiss prefer fondue Chinoise, mirroring the centuries-old hot pot recipe hailing from Mongolia and China.

Very little is known about the history of fondue Chinoise. There are rumours about a man from Switzerland visiting China in the 1950s and coming back home wanting to replicate his ""exotic"" adventures abroad, which ultimately led him to tweaking cheese fondue by swapping out dairy and bread for broth and meat. There are also stories that fondue Chinoise was created because mothers in the 1970s wanted to cook healthier versions of the cholesterol-rich classic.

Despite very little reported in Swiss literature or known about the truth of how fondue Chinoise came about in Switzerland, one thing is for sure – it is a much-loved custom and quintessential pastime during Christmas and New Year's celebrations.

American cookbook author and blogger Heddi Nieuwsma has adopted the Swiss Christmas tradition of serving fondue Chinoise. ""When we first moved to Switzerland, I was surprised to learn that fondue Chinoise was a typical Swiss dish for the holiday season, but it has become the meal we typically serve for our Christmas Eve dinner,"" she said. ""People like making it because it requires little preparation. For my family, the convenience of this meal means we can focus more on all the cooking and baking that needs to happen for the big Christmas meal the next day.""

Michelin-starred chef, Stéphane Décotterd of Maison Décotterd in Switzerland's Vaud region, explained that the beauty of fondue Chinoise is that ""everyone can make it their own and adapt it to their tastes"". This means using a variety of different proteins to dip into the slow-simmering broth at the table, or serving different sauces, which can range from curry-flavoured mayonnaise to zingy relishes.

With 26 cantons making up Switzerland, there are different versions of fondue Chinoise, explained Décotterd. ""In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, people like to add fruit as a garnish, because they appreciate the sweet and sour flavours. In French-speaking Switzerland, many people make a vigneronne fondue with a red wine broth. There are also Chinese fondues made entirely with game meat, and in the Valais region, they make a Chinese fondue called glareyarde, where the beef is marinated with herbs and spices a few days beforehand and the broth is wine-based,"" said Décotterd.

Décotterd added that there are no steadfast rules as to what you dip into your fondue Chinoise, but he recommends a mix of red and white meat. ""I like red meat like beef, duck, game meat like venison, and white poultry like chicken and turkey. One thing to remember is you should use cuts that cook quickly (like tenderloin), yet still retain their texture after cooking. These are all great served with a bowl of basmati rice and some light sauces, rather than the usual mayo-based sauce served at home.""

In the Nieuwsma household, scratch-made sauces served with fondue Chinoise are not always necessary. “I am a bit lazy and just use what we have on hand. I mix some curry powder with mayonnaise and also put some soy sauce, hot sauce and sweet chilli relishes on the table for everyone to help themselves.”

Fondue Chinoise recipe by Stéphane Décotterd

Serves 4

Décotterd makes a lighter version of mayonnaise sauce with creamy avocado instead.

Ingredients For the broth: 120g dried wood ear or shiitake mushrooms 3 tbsp olive oil 2 carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks 1 small turnip, peeled and cut into matchsticks 1 leek (white part only), peeled and cut into matchsticks 1 red capsicum, seeded and finely chopped 40g ginger, peeled and diced 1 lemongrass stick, thinly sliced crosswise 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce 1.5 litres water beef bouillon powder (optional), approximately 1 tsp but depends on the concentration of your brand 1 makrut lime leaf For the avocado sauce: 1 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted juice of 1 lemon 3 tbsp olive oil salt hot sauce, preferably Tabasco To serve: 200 to 250 grams meat per person (chicken, veal, beef), thinly sliced cooked basmati rice (optional)

Method

Step 1 Soak the mushrooms in cold water for 30 minutes. Rinse under cold running water to clean well. Drain and set aside.

Step 2 In a medium pot, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the drained mushrooms, along with the carrots, turnip, leek, capsicum, ginger and lemongrass. Cook until softened, about 6 to 8 minutes.

Step 3 Add the soy sauce to deglaze the pan, and then cover with the water. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Add the kaffir lime leaf.

Step 4 Meanwhile, make your avocado sauce. Blend the avocado and lemon juice, then blend with olive oil and season with salt and hot sauce.

Step 5 Transfer the hot broth to a fondue pot. Serve with thinly sliced meat for dipping, as well as avocado sauce and rice on the side, if desired.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67850900,Manchester United: Erik ten Hag's side ‘back to worst’ in Nottingham Forest loss,['Author not found'],"A season to forget so far for Manchester United brought a predictably dismal end to 2023.

The 2-1 defeat against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground swept away all the positive energy generated by the thrilling Boxing Day comeback against Aston Villa.

Proposed new club director Sir Dave Brailsford sat next to legendary former manager Sir Alex Ferguson for the latest painful staging post in an awful campaign that has already seen United lose an incredible 14 games - the most before the end of the year in a single season since 1930-31, when they finished bottom.

Big-money signings are not delivering and others with huge reputations are also underperforming.

As has been the case for the best part of a month now, Ten Hag has responded to a defeat by saying he cannot use injuries as an excuse yet at the same time insisting results will come when he gets the likes of Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount, Victor Lindelof, Rasmus Hojlund and Harry Maguire back.

Other observers are far less forgiving in their judgement, with former captain Gary Neville telling Sky Sports: ""Manchester United are back to their worst, back to what they are - inconsistent and awful.""

Just how bad has United's season been?

Manchester United have never had fewer points, nor scored fewer goals, at this point of a Premier League season.

Only in 1930 (28), 1972 (25) and 1921 (24) have they lost more games in a calendar year than the 21 defeats they suffered in 2023.

They have lost nine out of their opening 20 league games for the first time since 1989-90. United only lost nine times in the league in Ten Hag's first season in charge.

This season they have lost more games (14) than they have won (12) in all competitions.

United have lost five out of eight games in December, scoring six times and conceding 12.

Their best run of the season is three successive victories. They have won two games in a row just twice.

'No team can deal with so many injuries'

Ten Hag told Brailsford - a key figure for new club co-owners Ineos - he did not want to speak to him until there was a gap in his side's schedule.

That will come in January, when United have only one Premier League game - against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in a fortnight's time - after which they have a week off as part of the Premier League's winter break.

For Financial Fair Play reasons, United's January transfer window will be quiet unless there are significant outgoings - Jadon Sancho's future remains unresolved - and as part of the deal with the Glazer family, Ineos would have to be told of any business, even though they cannot legally run the club.

Whether Ten Hag will want any interruptions next week is open to question, with his side's next game at League One side Wigan in the FA Cup.

They memorably knocked Pep Guardiola's Manchester City out of the cup as a League One club in 2018 and Latics manager Shaun Maloney scored the only goal when Wigan beat United for the only time in 2012.

A repeat of that loss at the DW Stadium on 8 January is unthinkable in the current climate.

As for Ten Hag, he can only hope he is right when he says a fit squad - which he is hoping to have at his disposal by mid-January - will make all the difference.

""It is clear we are not consistent,"" he said. ""Every time I say it doesn't matter how we line up, we have to win, but the routines are not there because every time we have to swap. Football is quick, so you need communication in a split second. When the players are returning, I am sure this side will be stronger.- I believe.

""They [Ineos] know me. They know when I have a squad available the results will be there. This is part of a project. We were overperforming last year, this year we are underperforming. We have to step up and I have to lead that process.

""No team can deal with so many issues and injuries we have.""

Midfielder Christian Eriksen added: ""This season in general has been one step forward and two steps back and it felt like that today. Things will heal and get better.""

Manchester United have lost as many as nine of their opening 20 league games in a season for the first time since 1989-90

""The most boring team in the league?"" - how pundits reacted

Former defender Neville told Sky Sports: ""They [Ineos] will make a decision on the manager before the end of the season, I have no doubt, even though they will keep him in charge until the end of the season. They have been so poor though and if that continues, Erik ten Hag will find himself under real pressure.

""Ten Hag did a very good job in his first season, now the new ownership will be on a watching brief and Brailsford will look at what this club is and he is not going to like what he sees.

""I have more optimism under the new owners. They are currently operating without a sporting director, without a CEO and without a head of recruitment. What club in the world does that?

""Ten Hag is operating without a management team around him, which is incredible to think. He has been handed the keys to the safe and that shouldn't happen.""

Ex-Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I had someone message me earlier asking if Manchester United are the most boring team in the Premier League. You know what, it's hard to argue with that.

""The thing that troubles me with Erik ten Hag is I don't know what game he was watching when he comes out and answers like that. There comes a time when he has to take responsibility. He has spent over £400m.""

Former Wales midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""You are looking at the standard of players like Antony. He will develop but at Manchester United is the number of goals and assists he has good enough? No.

""Who has been saying, 'let's go and buy Antony for £90m' when he's worth £30m? Or Casemiro for £60m? And also, how many of the players who have been brought in have increased their value?""

'Ten Hag needs to be moved on' - what you said

James: This is so bad. No clue, no plan, no identity, and no desire. It's so bad. The 3-2 versus Villa papered over the cracks again. ETH needs to be moved on. The players don't understand him and what he wants. So obvious. Disgusting how the richest club in the world has the worst elite team.

Anon: I can't see ETH surviving much longer. It's clear the players are a big part of the problem but I can't see what he is trying to achieve. I don't know what the style is, there seems no plan, no effort, players stropping at one another. Maybe Ineos will think 'a new manager for a new start'.

Martin: All the hype on Tuesday about United having top-four hopes, welcome back to reality. Be lucky to be in the top half of the table.

Ben: One thing that really, really bugs me watching the conduct of United's players over the last few years is the general demeanour and attitude towards one another throughout a game. We witnessed Rashford doing it against Villa to Hojlund, stropping and having a go. For goodness sake, support each other, give your team-mates a lift! I expect that for £200k+ a week...

James: The only thing I don't understand is how on earth Man Utd will be seventh in the Premier League after this match.

Andrew: United take off Mainoo half-time. No defensive midfielder on the pitch. Concede two goals from the defensive midfielder position. This is not rocket science.

Nigel: Sums it up for me. Forest were fighting to the end, we just looked like we were turning up again and hoping for the best. We can't continue to paper over cracks.","Manchester United have never had fewer points, nor scored fewer goals, at this point of a Premier League season.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/darts/67849359,PDC World Championship 2024: Luke Littler beats Raymond van Barneveld to reach quarter-finals,['Author not found'],"Luke Littler continued his historic run at the PDC World Darts Championship with a sensational 4-1 victory over five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld to reach the quarter-finals.

The 16-year-old powered past the Dutchman with a stunning display to send the Alexandra Palace crowd wild.

Littler was born 21 days after Van Barneveld, 56, won the most recent of his five world titles in 2007.

He will play Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan in the last eight.

""Unbelievable. I don't know what to say,"" he told Sky Sports.

""I went 2-0 up, 3-0 up, then I said to my family, 'one set away and I'm over the line'.""

Littler, who has now won £50,000 in prize money, admitted in the build-up to Saturday's game that Van Barneveld was his idol growing up, posting a video of himself as a youngster on social media re-enacting the Dutchman's signature 'arms outstretched' celebration.

But he showed no sign of being in awe of the veteran, as he averaged 105 and hit nine 180s to become the youngest player to reach the quarter-finals of the World Championships.

""He [Van Barneveld] said to me 'you can go all the way, I hope you can go all the way'. I said 'thank you' - he's a true gentleman and I respect Raymond very, very much,"" added Littler, who was doing his GCSEs just six months ago.

Littler's sensational run has seen him rise from obscurity to sporting stardom, with Arsenal footballers Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale asking for a photograph with him in a hotel last week.

The Manchester United-supporting youngster, who has been playing darts since he was 18 months old, also received a good luck message from Red Devils defender Jonny Evans and former United captain Gary Neville before his meeting with Van Barneveld.

That hype will only continue as he prepares for his meeting with Dolan on New Year's Day.

Asked whether he believed he could lift the trophy, Littler said: ""I fancy myself, I do fancy myself, but we have Brendan next. Let's just focus on Brendan.""

Northern Irishman Dolan is also enjoying a memorable run as he caused another upset by beating two-time champion Gary Anderson 4-3.

The 28th seed, who beat 2021 champion Gerwyn Price in the previous round, conceded a two-set lead to trail 3-2 but hit back to level then took a tense decider to eliminate the 2015 and 2016 winner.

Meanwhile, world number three Luke Humphries squeezed through to the next round with a pulsating 4-3 win over Joe Cullen.

With the score at three sets each, both players missed nine match darts between them to leave a chaotic final set level at 5-5 and force a sudden-death leg.

Humphries then showed his composure to win the game with a 100 checkout and leave Cullen looking visibly emotional as he left the stage.

""That is one of the best games I have ever been a part of,"" Humphries told Sky Sports.

""I feel so sorry for Joe. Sometimes in darts it doesn't deserve a loser and I don't think Joe deserved to lose that game.

""But I never gave up and that allows me to keep going.""

Scott Williams set up a quarter-final meeting with three-time winner Michael van Gerwen after breezing past Australia's Damon Heta 4-1.

Williams apologised after the game for his comments about Germany following his win over Martin Schindler in the previous round.

Rob Cross is through to the last eight for the first time since he won the title in 2018 after he beat Jonny Clayton 4-0 to set up a meeting with Chris Dobey.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67809578,Man City 2-0 Sheff Utd: Rodri and Julian Alvarez score as defending champions close gap at top,['Author not found'],"Rodri scored City's late winner when they beat Sheffield United in August, and opened the scoring early on this time, with his fifth goal of the season

Manchester City ended a stellar year on a high note by beating a battling Sheffield United side to move within two points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Rodri gave the defending champions an early breakthrough when he latched on to Phil Foden's neat pass and fired into the bottom corner of the net from the edge of the area.

The Blades' packed defence meant City had to wait to add a second but Foden was the provider again when it arrived midway through the second half, with his low cross despatched by Julian Alvarez.

City, who were crowned Fifa Club World Cup winners before Christmas, displayed all five of the major trophies they have won in 2023 on the pitch before kick-off.

It was a reminder to their rivals that they remain the team to beat this season, and so was the sight of Kevin de Bruyne in their squad after more than four months out with a hamstring injury.

The Belgium midfielder did not make it on to the pitch this time, but the sight of him warming up on the touchline in the second half brought huge cheers from the home fans.

In contrast, the Sheffield United fans had little to get excited about, as their side offered little in attack other than a flurry of chances just before the break.

Defeat felt inevitable as soon as City scored their second goal, and Chris Wilder's side remain bottom of the table, and without an away win this season.

City chasing more glory in 2024

The five trophies Manchester City won in 2023 were on display before kick-off

City had dropped points through conceding late equalisers in each of their past three home league games, but there was never any danger of a repeat of that here.

As well as the victory, which means they have secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since the start of November, they also had a first clean sheet in eight games to celebrate.

It had already been a productive festive period for Pep Guardiola's side, who saw all the teams above them drop points, and they appear to have put any talk of a pre-Christmas crisis well behind them.

""We are not top, but I could not expect that with the results we had,"" Guardiola said afterwards.

""Apart from two or three games, we played really well without the results that maybe we deserved - but in football what you deserve doesn't count, it is a business and you have to win games - and here we did it.

""I am really pleased for the guys, after two days rest [after beating Everton on Wednesday].

""It was an intense month for all the Premier League teams I would say but the travel to Saudi Arabia was an incredibly positive impact on all of us, for the trophy first and to be together, after the disappointment of drawing with Crystal Palace after an incredibly good performance.""

City can look back with pride at their achievements in 2023, but they also have lots to look forward to in 2024.

De Bruyne's seemingly imminent return to action is a major boost and they will hope to welcome Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku back from injury in January, as they push on in search of more silverware - starting in the FA Cup, where they host Huddersfield next weekend.

""In terms of titles and prizes, the past year was really good,"" Guardiola added. ""To see the five trophies on the pitch was really nice.

""We are so satisfied and proud but at the same time, now they are in the trophy cabinet and it is Huddersfield next.""

Blades show spirit but lack quality

While Sheffield United showed plenty of spirit here, they were clearly short of sufficient quality to seriously trouble their hosts.

The Blades end the year bottom of the table and they must make history if they are to stay up from here, as no Premier League team has managed that after earning so few points after 20 games.

It is difficult to assess exactly where Wilder needs reinforcements going on this display, given the gulf between these two sides.

But the fact that, so far, they have so far scored the fewest goals in the top flight, as well as conceding the most, suggests improvements are needed all over the pitch when the January transfer window opens, if they are to have any hope of survival.

""There's no downside from this game, with the experience it's given some of our younger players,"" Wilder said afterwards.

""For me it wasn't just regarding this game, because we always knew it would be incredibly tough to go and get a result at City. It is the overall six games [since he took charge] that I have reflected on when I spoke to the players afterwards - what they have given me, and what they have shown.

""I said after the first game against Liverpool, don't kid me, is this a one off? And it wasn't, in terms of their attitude.

""And now what we have is hopefully some additions coming into the group [in January] and precious time to work on the training ground, where we can work on all aspects of our play.

""But I think if you asked any Sheffield United supporter what they've taken from the past six games, it's that the team has got fight in them, and it's the same from my point of view.""

If Aston Villa needed to signal that they are genuine Premier League title challengers, their victory over Burnley fulfilled that requirement.

Not that their 3-2 win over the Clarets was convincing, far from it. It was only sealed in the final minutes of regulation time through a penalty which struck the bar twice.

But it ticked the box of winning ugly, of securing three points even when well below their best. If Villa - now level on points with leaders Liverpool - are to stay in the title race, these are the wins they need.

""It was very important after our last two matches without points like we want,"" Aston Villa manager Unai Emery told Match of the Day.

""We did very good work, but we struggled in some moments. I respect Burnley a lot because they are doing a lot of good work.""

An action-packed match saw the hosts lead three times, culminating in Douglas Luiz scoring a penalty after Villa academy product Aaron Ramsey - who joined Burnley in the summer - tripped Jhon Duran.

Luiz's penalty was itself suitably chaotic - after taking an age to begin his run-up, the Brazilian's shot hit the bar, bounced on the line and hit the bar again, before finally landing in James Trafford's net.

It was the denouement of a game which saw Burnley denied a first-half lead by a narrow offside call, Villa take a first-half lead following a narrow offside call and the visitors reduced to 10 men after two avoidable yellow cards for Sander Berge.

If Villa do produce one of the greatest Premier League title triumphs, this will be viewed as a pivotal win - even if it wasn't one of their most clinical.

'Winning in the last moment, sometimes it's important'

""The goals, VAR and the red card in the second half - they were close to getting something and we had to push until the last minute but we carried on and in the end we got the penalty,"" said Emery.

""Winning in the last moment with some emotion, sometimes it is important.""

This win also caps off a truly remarkable 12 months under Emery, particularly at Villa Park.

Villa have won more home games - 17 - and earned more home points - 53 - in the Premier League in 2023 than any other side.

Douglas Luiz's penalty ensured Villa have rescued three home points late in matches over the Christmas period

They have now scored in their last 24 home league matches - Villa's longest run since 33 consecutive games scored in between May 1982 and December 1983.

Only goal difference is keeping Liverpool ahead of Villa at present. If the Reds fail to beat Newcastle on New Year's Day, Villa will be alone at the summit if they beat Everton on 14 January.

There is an awfully long way to go, but especially at home, they look ready for the fight.

""It is very difficult, we are very happy we are being competitive and at home we feel very strong with our support,"" said Emery.

Villa ahead of Leicester mark

The last time Villa had it this good after 20 games of a Premier League season was when they went top of the table on 8 January 1999. This was followed by a 10-match winless run and they ultimately finished sixth.

The lessons of history, plus the unconvincing performances over the present Christmas period, should prevent anyone associated with Villa getting overexcited.

Villa could have been ending an immense 2023 with three games without a win, this match following a draw with bottom club Sheffield United and a defeat at Manchester United where they lost a two-goal lead.

But through a mix of luck, skill and sheer force, Villa continue to barge ahead of the big names around them.

They are also still ahead of where Leicester City were in their historic title triumph of 2015-16.

Leicester were also second after 20 games, but with only 40 points after being held at home to Bournemouth. Villa, thanks to that late penalty, are two points better off.

Hugo Lloris won the 2018 World Cup and retired from international football in January having become the country's most-capped player, with 145 international appearances

Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC from Tottenham on a free transfer.

The 37-year-old has signed a deal through to the end of the 2024 season, with the option for a further two years.

Lloris made 447 appearances in 11 years at Spurs, putting him seventh on their all-time list.

""Spurs will always be a special place for me and all my family,"" said the former France international.

""It has been a great privilege to be one of yours and one of your captains for many years and it's the end of the chapter, but you will be always in my hearts.""

LAFC co-president and general manager John Thorrington described Lloris as ""arguably the most successful goalkeeper of his generation and a proven winner"".

Lloris joined Tottenham from Lyon in 2012 and was appointed captain by former boss Mauricio Pochettino in 2015.

He was part of the Tottenham side that reached the 2019 Champions League final but expressed a desire to leave the club in the summer as he entered the final 12 months of his contract.

He has not played since a 6-1 loss to Newcastle in April and has found himself behind Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster this season.

Lloris will come on to the pitch at half-time of Sunday's Premier League match against Bournemouth (14:00 GMT) at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to say goodbye to the fans.","Last updated on .From the section United States Major League SoccerHugo Lloris won the 2018 World Cup and retired from international football in January having become the country's most-capped player, with 145 international appearancesGoalkeeper Hugo Lloris has joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC from Tottenham on a free transfer.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67849327,Luton 2-3 Chelsea: 'That's why we call him Cold Palmer' - forward shines again,['Author not found'],"""That's why we call him Cold Palmer.""

Those were the words of Palmer's team-mate Noni Madueke after yet another match-winning performance from the 21-year-old forward as Chelsea survived a late scare to win 3-2 at Luton.

The ex-Manchester City man showed his coolness with a brilliant brace and he celebrated both goals with his arms crossed to symbolise the new 'cold' nickname his team-mates have given him.

Eyebrows were raised when it was announced Chelsea were signing Palmer from Manchester City for £42.5m, but that price is already starting to look like a bargain.

'He is a decisive player'

Since signing in the summer, Palmer has been involved in 12 Premier League goals, scoring eight himself and providing assists for four others.

The only player currently aged 21 or under who has been involved in more in Europe's top five leagues this season is Jude Bellingham, who has been central to 15 goals at his new club Real Madrid.

Palmer's opening goal was a ruthless finish after he was presented the ball in the penalty area, before his pass to Madueke set up a second. He completed his brace with an individual effort that will be replayed time and time again such is the composure and skill on show.

Palmer has stepped up when Chelsea have needed him and the 21-year-old has cemented himself as a key player for Pochettino.

He is now the club's designated penalty-taker and he has forced himself into the England squad and has a good chance of going to the European Championship in Germany next summer.

It is the fourth time this season that Palmer has scored and assisted in the same game, which is more than any other player in the league.

He is also only the fifth Chelsea player to reach double figures for goal involvements (eight goals, four assists) in a single Premier League season while aged 21 or under, joining a list which also includes Arjen Robben, Eden Hazard, Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount.

""Hopefully it is just the start. I have adapted to a new life, new team-mates and the city. Hopefully I can show more on the pitch as well,"" Palmer said.

Pochettino will be hoping that is the case for Palmer and Chelsea as they look to improve on a poor 2023.

""He is an important player for us,"" he said. ""He is a decisive player. I am so pleased with him and the team.""

Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas described Palmer as ""sensational"" on TNT Sports.

A year to forget

Graham Potter was sacked after less than seven months in charge following a 2-0 home defeat by Aston Villa

For many at Chelsea, the last 12 months will be a year they hope will not be repeated.

They have gone through four managers, including the one match when Bruno Saltor took charge, and only Fulham and Everton have lost more Premier League games than the Blues (19) this calendar year.

One of the main issues that has blighted Chelsea is their inability to take chances when they are on top in matches.

The Blues have missed 40 ""big chances"" according to Opta stats, the most in the Premier League this season.

Nicolas Jackson has been leading the line but, at 22 years old and in his first season in the Premier League, has struggled.

Big-money summer signing Christopher Nkunku only returned from injury in the defeat by Wolves but the inability to take chances has led to discussion about whether the club needs to sign a new striker.

Chelsea are unlikely to spend more than £100m for a player in the upcoming January transfer window - making the likes of Ivan Toney or Victor Oshimen unlikely signings - but the club will be looking to bring in a forward in the next two windows.

""Always we have very good communication,"" said Pochettino. ""We are not worried about that. We are going to assess now, we have a few days and we will start the transfer window.

""We will talk and see if we need to do something or not.

""The most important is to work with the squad, it is only now pushing them to step up, recovering players, that is my focus, 100% to try to improve our squad and the players that we have.""","Eyebrows were raised when it was announced Chelsea were signing Palmer from Manchester City for £42.5m, but that price is already starting to look like a bargain.
