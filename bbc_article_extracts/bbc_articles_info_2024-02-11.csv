Watch: Trump would not protect countries from attack by Russia if they do not pay enough into Nato

Donald Trump's suggestion the US would not protect Nato allies failing to spend enough on defence ""undermines all of our security"", the Western military alliance's chief has said.

Jens Stoltenberg also suggested it put US and European troops at greater risk.

The Republican said he had told allies he would ""encourage"" Russia to attack any Nato member that failed to meet the alliance's target of 2% of their GDP.

Members of Nato commit to defend any nation in the bloc that gets attacked.

President Joe Biden called Mr Trump's comments ""appalling and dangerous"", suggesting his predecessor intended to give Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a green light for more war and violence"".

Addressing crowds during a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, Mr Trump said he had made his comments about Russia during a previous meeting of leaders of Nato countries.

The former president recalled that the leader of a ""big country"" had presented a hypothetical situation in which he was not meeting his financial obligations within Nato and had come under attack from Moscow.

He said the leader had asked if the US would come to his country's aid in that scenario, which prompted him to issue a rebuke.

""I said: 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?'... 'No I would not protect you, in fact I would encourage them to do whatever they want. You gotta pay.'""

The frontrunner for the Republican nomination for this year's presidential election did not make clear which nation or leader he was speaking about, or even when this conversation took place.

According to Nato's own figures for 2023 spending, 19 of its 30 member nations are spending below the target of 2% of their annual GDP on defence - among them Germany, Norway and France.

But most countries which border Ukraine, Russia, or its neighbour and ally Belarus, are exceeding this guideline.

At over 3.9% of its annual GDP, Poland spends even more than the US. Romania, Hungary, Finland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia range between 2.3 and 2.7% for defence expenditure.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr Stoltenberg emphasised the alliance remains ""ready and able"" to defend its members and any attack ""will be met with a united and forceful response"".

But he said any suggestion that ""allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security"", and suggested Mr Trump's remarks ""put American and European soldiers at increased risk"".

""I expect that regardless of who wins the presidential election the US will remain a strong and committed Nato ally,"" he added.

Following Mr Stoltenberg's comments, US President Joe Biden said: ""Donald Trump's admission that he intends to give Putin a green light for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic states, [is] appalling and dangerous.""

Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's only remaining rival for the Republican nomination, warned against taking the side of Russia and Mr Putin - who she described as a ""thug who kills his opponents"" in an interview with the BBC's US partner CBS News.

Nikki Haley says the last thing the US ""would ever want to do is side with Russia""

Mr Trump has long been critical of Nato and what he sees as an excessive financial burden on the United States to guarantee the defence of 30 other nations.

Dr Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert and former Nato analyst, told the BBC that Mr Trump was reflecting anger in the US that some European Nato countries were not spending 2% of their budget on the military, as Nato wants.

""Playing hardball with Nato allies is correct, but it all depends on how far you go. These comments are too far, really,"" he said.

But he said such statements had an impact at a time when Russia had put its economy onto a war footing and its military spending was outstripping that of European countries.

""If Trump is in the White House and there was a split in Nato either over Ukraine... or about how it would respond to a small incursion that should in theory trigger article five. That's where the Nato alliance is worried are these what-ifs,"" he said.

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after Mr Trump left office. He has since bemoaned the amount of US money sent to Ukraine, which is not a Nato member.

The US has provided Ukraine with more financial support than any other country - totalling more than $44bn (£34bn) since the 2022 invasion, according to White House figures from December.

However, Republicans in Congress have since the turn of the year blocked all new funding - demanding tough measures to restrict migration into the US on its southern border, and then refusing the amended bill when it was presented earlier this week.

Mr Trump celebrated that rejection during Saturday's rally, saying the proposals made by President Biden had been ""disastrous"".","Nato chief says Donald Trump comments 'undermine all of our security'By Adam Durbin BBC NewsWatch: Trump would not protect countries from attack by Russia if they do not pay enough into NatoDonald Trump's suggestion the US would not protect Nato allies failing to spend enough on defence ""undermines all of our security"", the Western military alliance's chief has said.

Taylor Swift has invited some famous friends to the Super Bowl, including rapper Ice Spice and actress Blake Lively

Taylor Swift has arrived at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, with footage from the stadium showing her with famous friends Blake Lively and Ice Spice.

The singer, who is dating the Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce made it in the nick of time after playing a concert in Japan on Saturday evening.

Her journey, from Tokyo to Los Angeles, was tracked by thousands online.

Swift has recently threatened to sue a student who tracks her private jet and shares its movements online.

Ahead of Sunday's big game, many had wondered which friends and family she would bring along with her to watch.

A video from the stadium shows her parents, Andrea and Scott Swift, with her, In another clip, Swift was seen greeting Travis Kelce's brother, Jason Kelce, who is also a NFL player.

Earlier this month, the Japanese embassy in the US joined the conversation surrounding Swift's Super Bowl dash, posting a statement about it on social media.

""If she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins,"" the embassy said.

The 17-hour time difference between Tokyo and Los Angeles is thought to have helped Swift get back to the US in time to visit her home in LA before heading to Sin City.

In 2022, Swift topped the list of celebrities with the highest private jet CO2 emissions, according to digital marketing firm Yard.

Swift has been a regular at games since she began dating tight end Travis Kelce - and is credited with bringing along thousands of new fans to the sport.

""The viewership for this game is on a seemingly inexorable march toward more viewers, and this year Taylor Swift may be playing the role of drum major,"" said Prof Daniel Ladik, chief methodologist for the poll.

Many hope Swift's presence will also spur on the defending champions, who are playing their fourth Super Bowl in five years.

Usher learned to skate for his Las Vegas residency, which ran for 100 sold-out shows

R&B singer Usher has promised to roller-skate during his Super Bowl half-time show in Las Vegas.

He would recreate a skating sequence that had become a viral highlight of his recent Vegas residency, he said.

And the show would be a ""crescendo"" marking a ""new beginning"" in his 30-year career.

Previous Super Bowl half-time show performers include Katy Perry, Prince and Beyoncé.

But Usher will be the first independent artist to take the stage, having left his previous record label, RCA, to self-release his album, Coming Home, this weekend.

When and where can I see the show?

Usher will take to the stage midway through the Super Bowl.

The match will start at 23:30 UK time (15:30 in Las Vegas). Depending on how the game progresses, half-time will be about an hour-and-a-half or two hours into the action. That puts Usher's performance at around 01:00-01:30 UK time (17:00-17:30 in Las Vegas).

In the US, the match will be screened on CBS and streamed on Paramount+. Viewers in the UK can follow it on ITV1 and ITVX from 22:45.

If you don't want to stay up and watch the concert live, the NFL typically puts the whole show on YouTube immediately after its broadcast, and Apple Music subscribers can watch it back in spatial audio.

The San Francisco 49ers are favourites to win Sunday's match

Hit records

Interviewed earlier this week by Apple Music's Nadeska Alexis, Usher ducked several questions about his setlist.

""It definitely has been a challenge to squeeze 30 years in to 13 minutes,"" Usher said, eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses.

He had been ""very mindful of my past"" and the ""songs I feel people know me for"", as well as iconic dance routines from his career.

Asked about potential guest performers, Usher hinted he would be joined by singers who featured ""on songs that became hit records"".

""That gave me the greatest point of reference,"" said the singer, whose collaborators include Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Alicia Keys and Lil' Jon.

Usher will play at the Allegiant Stadium, as the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers.

He follows Rihanna, who performed the 2023 half-time show while pregnant, and 2022's all-star team of Dr Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J Blige, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and 50 Cent.

Usher himself has previously appeared on the Super Bowl stage. As a special guest with the Black Eyed Peas, in 2011, he performed a breathtaking leap over will.i.am, landing in the splits.

Country singer Reba McEntire will perform America's national anthem. Post Malone will sing America the Beautiful. And Andra Day will conclude the pre-game concert with Lift Every Voice and Sing, often called the black national anthem. While dance musician Tiesto will be the Super Bowl's first-ever in-game DJ.

Usher has announced a new album and US tour to capitalise on his Super Bowl performance

Usher Raymond IV started singing in church in Tennessee at the age of nine. He joined a group called NuBeginning a year later and they recorded an album in 1991, which only came out after Usher hit the big time.

After the family moved to Atlanta, Usher was spotted at talent show and signed by LA Reid, the executive who also discovered TLC, Toni Braxton, and OutKast.

His first song, Call Me A Mack, appeared on the soundtrack to the Tupac Shakur and Janet Jackson film Poetic Justice when he was just 15 years old, but his debut album, produced by P Diddy, tanked.

He tried again with producer Jermaine Dupri, who made his name working with Da Brat and Mariah Carey.

Together, they figured out a sound for Usher's second album, My Way, that combined his buttery smooth tenor with stuttering, hip-hop beats that allowed him to show off his skills as a dancer.

The first single, You Make Me Wanna, was only held off the US number one spot by Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana, Candle in the Wind, in 1997. The follow-up, Nice & Slow, made it to the top, and Usher never looked back.

Over the next decade, he sold 80 million records worldwide, won eight Grammy Awards and scored four consecutive US number ones - Yeah, Burn, Confessions Pt II and My Boo - which are all-but-guaranteed to feature in his Super Bowl performance.

The 2010s were less kind - the title of his eighth album Hard II Love was unintentionally prophetic - but his reputation as a dazzling live performer remained.

After a stint as a judge on The Voice, he launched a Las Vegas residency in 2022, culminating in 100 sold out shows and, ultimately, the Super Bowl.

Why is the Super Bowl half-time show so important?

Rihanna revealed she was expecting her second child at last year's half-time show

The Super Bowl is always the most-watched programme on US television - and the half-time show regularly pulls in more viewers than the match itself.

Rihanna got the biggest-ever audience in 2022, with 121 million people tuning in. Even when the bookings aren't as stellar - like Maroon 5 in 2019 - the viewership has been close to 100 million.

The platform is so big that many performers, including Usher and Rihanna, play for no fee.

Not that Usher isn't profiting from his appearance - he's announced a new album and a US tour to coincide with his performance. Fans are already clamouring for UK dates.

Will Taylor Swift be watching?

It may have escaped your attention, because the media has barely mentioned it, but Taylor Swift if currently dating Kansas City player Travis Kelce.

She's attended more than 10 of his games over the course of the season - but her attendance at the Super Bowl is in doubt, because she's playing a concert in Tokyo the night before.

Asked about her plans, Kelce said Swift was ""focused on entertaining the crowd"" in Japan and ""making sure she's ready for her performances"".

""But the Super Bowl? We will just worry about if she can make it.""

The Japanese Embassy in Washington weighed in on the question - saying that, due to the time difference between the US and Japan, Swift could make the 12-hour flight and ""comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins"".

Meanwhile, right-wing conspiracy theorists have claimed the Super Bowl has been ""rigged"" in order to help Swift (who has endorsed Democratic politicians) and Kelce (who appeared in ads for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine) clinch victory for Joe Biden in the forthcoming US presidential election.","Super Bowl 2024: Usher promises to roller-skate during half-time performanceBy Mark Savage BBC Music CorrespondentGetty ImagesUsher learned to skate for his Las Vegas residency, which ran for 100 sold-out showsR&B singer Usher has promised to roller-skate during his Super Bowl half-time show in Las Vegas.

Watch: ""I did not handle this right,"" Lloyd Austin apologises

US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is back in the hospital for an ""emergent bladder issue"", the Pentagon said.

The White House has been informed, the Pentagon said on Sunday, and Mr Austin will continue to carry out his duties.

It comes less than a month after his secretive hospital stay in December sparked controversy for which he apologised last week.

Late last year, Mr Austin had surgery for prostate cancer.

He was readmitted to hospital on New Year's Day with severe pain in his leg, hip and abdomen because of complications related to the procedure. An evaluation found a urinary tract infection and he remained in hospital for more than two weeks.

Senior defence officials and the Biden administration did not know that Mr Austin was seriously ill until three days after his re-admission in January.

The incident incited concerns over both transparency and security and prompted three separate investigations into Mr Austin's handling of his illness and hospital stays.

He has been called to testify in front of a Congressional committee about his failure to inform President Biden and other top officials this week, on 14 February.

For this most recent hospital admission, the Deputy Secretary of Defence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have also been notified. The deputy secretary is prepared to assume Mr Austin's duties, if required, the Pentagon said.","Lloyd Austin: Defence secretary returns to hospitalBy Holly Honderich in WashingtonWatch: ""I did not handle this right,"" Lloyd Austin apologisesUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is back in the hospital for an ""emergent bladder issue"", the Pentagon said.

By Adam Durbin BBC News

Reuters

Many of the 1.5m people in Rafah are living in tents near the Egyptian border

US President Joe Biden told Israel's prime minister a military operation in Rafah should not happen without measures to ensure the safety of civilians, the White House has said.

In a call with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden said Israel needed a ""credible and executable plan"" to protect the more than a million people in the city.

Israel is facing growing international warnings over its planned offensive.

Mr Netanyahu has insisted it will go ahead and a plan is being prepared.

The call between the two leaders comes days after Mr Biden suggested Israel's military operations in Gaza were ""over the top"".

It also follows a raft of Israel's allies, international organisations and regional powers expressing growing concern at suggestions Israeli troops would enter Rafah - which lies on the border with Egypt and is the only open point of entry for humanitarian aid.

UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said ""over half of Gaza's population are sheltering in the area"", while Saudi Arabia warned of ""very serious repercussions"" if Rafah was stormed.

The United Nations has said there is nowhere safe to go for the 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in the city in the far south of the Strip.

Many of the people are living in tents in refugee camps, having already been forced to flee their homes elsewhere in Gaza at least once on the orders of the Israeli military.

Meanwhile, the Strip's Hamas rulers said there could be ""tens of thousands"" of casualties, warning that any operation would also undermine talks about a possible release of Israeli hostages held in the strip.

The warnings about an escalation of fighting in Rafah came after Mr Netanyahu ordered his military to prepare to evacuate civilians from the city ahead of an expanded offensive against Hamas.

Israel launched its operations in the Palestinian enclave after more than 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, who also took about 240 people hostage.

On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 112 more Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military over the previous day, bringing the overall death toll to more than 28,100 and more than 67,500 injured.

In their call on Sunday, the White House said Mr Biden ""reaffirmed his view that a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there"".

He repeated Israel and the US shared goal of seeing Hamas defeated and ensuring Israel's long-term security, while he also called for ""urgent and specific steps"" to increase humanitarian aid to civilians trapped in Gaza.

Negotiators working on a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have made ""real progress"" over the last few weeks, a senior White House official told Reuters.

The official said this deal was the main focus of the call between the Israeli and US leaders, but they also told the news agency that there were still some significant gaps to close.

In an interview with US broadcaster ABC News aired on Sunday, the Israeli PM said ""victory is in reach"" and the Israeli military were ""going to get the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Rafah"".

He also said Israel would ""provide safe passage"" for civilians in the southern city.

When pressed about where they should go, Mr Netanyahu suggested there were ""plenty"" of areas ""that we've cleared north of Rafah"" and insisted officials were ""working out a detailed plan"".

""Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, 'Lose the war. Keep Hamas there,'"" he added.

Israel's allies have warned against a ground offensive in Rafah, where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza

The US has already warned Israel that an invasion of Rafah as part of its assault on Gaza would be a ""disaster"", while the EU and the UN both expressed their own concerns.

Aid groups say it is not possible to evacuate everyone from the city.

UN humanitarian co-ordinator Jamie McGoldrick, who has just been to Gaza to assess the situation, told the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher that people in Rafah would have ""nowhere to go"" if Israeli troops launched their offensive.

""The safe areas that were declared are no longer safe. And if these people have to move - where can they move? We are really fearful of the horrific nature of where we are could only ever get worse,"" he said.

In other developments over the weekend:

At least six Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa

On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its air force killed two Hamas operatives in the southern city

The IDF also said it discovered a tunnel shaft near a school run by the relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) that was leading to an ""underground terrorist tunnel beneath UNRWA's main headquarters""

UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini denied any knowledge of a Hamas tunnel near the agency's office - a building which he said his staff vacated months ago

A six-year-old girl who went missing in Gaza City last month was found dead with several of her relatives and two paramedics - after appearing to come under fire from Israeli tanks

The IDF on Sunday said troops fighting in the southern city of Khan Younis had killed ""approximately 100 terrorists""

Three patients have died as Israeli troops prevented oxygen from getting to al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, the Palestine Red Crescent Society has said

The BBC is unable to independently verify many battlefield claims made during the course of the war.

Kelvin Kiptum broke Eliud Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last October

The men's marathon world record holder, Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum, 24, has died in a road accident in his home country, a Kenyan athletics official has confirmed to the BBC.

He was killed alongside his coach, Rwanda's Gervais Hakizimana in a car on a road near the town of Eldoret.

Kiptum emerged in 2023 as a rival to his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge.

He broke Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last October, running the 26.1 miles in two hours and 35 seconds.

Just last week, his team announced that he would attempt to run the distance in under two hours at the Rotterdam marathon - a feat that has never been achieved in open competition.

Kenya's opposition leader and former prime minister, Raila Odinga, said on X that the country had lost ""a true hero"" and was mourning ""a remarkable individual... and Kenyan athletics icon"".

Paying tribute to the young man, Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, described Kiptum as ""an incredible athlete leaving an incredible legacy, we will miss him dearly"".

The rise to fame for the father-of-two had been rapid - he only ran his first full marathon in 2022.

He competed in his first major competition four years earlier running in borrowed shoes as he could not afford a pair of his own.

He was among a new crop of Kenyan athletes who began their careers on the road, breaking away from the past tradition of athletes starting on the track before switching to longer distances.

Kiptum told the BBC last year that his unusual choice was simply determined by a lack of resources.","Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum: Marathon world record holder dies in road accidentBy Celestine Karoney BBC Sport Africa, NairobiGetty ImagesKelvin Kiptum broke Eliud Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last OctoberThe men's marathon world record holder, Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum, 24, has died in a road accident in his home country, a Kenyan athletics official has confirmed to the BBC.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68196261,Afcon 2023: Nigeria 1-2 Ivory Coast,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Football

Sebastien Haller was the hero for Ivory Coast again as the Elephants came from behind to beat Nigeria and win the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations final on home soil.

The striker, who had also netted the semi-final winner just 13 months on from his return from testicular cancer, flicked in Simon Adingra's cross with the toe of his boot with nine minutes remaining to complete a second-half comeback and spark wild celebrations in Abidjan.

William Troost-Ekong had put Nigeria ahead seven minutes before the end of a cagey first half when the centre-back rose highest to powerfully head in from nine yards out following a corner.

Franck Kessie nodded in the equaliser in the 62nd minute when he was left unmarked at the back post from Adingra's corner.

After a remarkable run to the final, which included the departure of coach Jean-Louis Gasset after two defeats in the group stage, the Ivorians clinched a third continental title with a deserved victory.

The West Africans add to their previous Nations Cup wins in 1992 and 2015 and become the first tournament hosts to triumph since Egypt lifted the trophy in 2006.

Interim coach Emerse Fae masterminded Ivory Coast's passage through the knockout stages, which included dramatic victories over defending champions Senegal and Mali after late equalisers in both games.

Ivory Coast spent more than $1bn (£0.79bn) on hosting the tournament, investing a similar amount on improving infrastructure in the country, and Ivorian President Alassane Outtara joined in the post-match celebrations in the stadium bearing his name.

The Elephants pick up $7m (£5.54m) in prize money, with Nigeria handed $4m by the Confederation of African Football.

Nigeria, three-time continental champions themselves, had previously been unbeaten at the finals, including a 1-0 win over the Ivorians in the group stage, but the Super Eagles rarely imposed themselves after sitting back for most of the contest.

Adingra inspires Elephants turnaround

Sebastien Haller (left) had also scored the winner for Ivory Coast in their semi-final win over DR Congo

Ivory Coast dominated most of the first half in front of a fervent crowd at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium, but failed to carve out chances as Nigeria sat deep and soaked up pressure.

The game sparked into life after the drinks break on the half-hour mark, with Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali blocking Adingra's shot from a narrow angle before Nigeria left-back Zaidu Sanusi won a corner when his effort was blocked by Odilon Kossounou.

Ademola Lookman's inswinging corner was headed up into the air by Ivory Coast midfielder Jean Michael Seri at the near post, and Troost-Ekong leapt above Serge Aurier to guide the ball back across goal and past the despairing dive of Elephants keeper Yahia Fofana.

The Ivorians came out with renewed purpose after the break, with the lively Adingra at the heart of their best moments on the left flank.

A dangerous low cross from the Brighton winger was tipped away by Nwabali and Calvin Bassey made a crucial block to prevent an equaliser after Max Gradel pounced on the loose ball.

Nwabali then had to dive to his right to scramble a long-range shot from Kossounou wide, and the Elephants equalised from the resulting corner as the Nigeria defence somehow failed to pick up Kessie.

The Super Eagles had a chance to retake the lead when Troost-Ekong headed a free-kick from Ademola Lookman wide, but the decisive moment came from an inspired finish by Haller when the Borussia Dortmund man stuck out his right leg to flick Adingra's cross past Nwabali.

Fairy tale ending for Fae

Emerse Fae (far right, in white) coached Nice's youth teams and was the reserve team of French Ligue 1 club Clermont before becoming Ivory Coast's assistant coach in May 2022

The tournament, which was delayed from its intended staging in June and July last year because of weather concerns in West Africa, will live long in the memory after a record number of goals, unrelenting upsets and an apparent capacity for unceasing drama.

Much of that was provided by the hosts, who had appeared on the brink of an early exit after a shock 4-0 defeat by Equatorial Guinea in their final Group A outing.

And so it begins. Nine months still to go before the next US presidential election and already the Republican party favourite and former President Donald Trump is sending eyebrows and blood pressure skywards in Nato capitals with his provocative statements.

And yet they will delight many of his supporters.

Suggesting at a rally in South Carolina that he would ""encourage"" aggressors (for example Russia) ""to do whatever the hell they want"" with Nato countries that fail to pay their dues has prompted an immediate condemnation from the White House. A spokesman called the comment ""appalling and unhinged"", saying it was ""encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes"".

Nato Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has also responded forcefully, saying: ""Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the US, and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.""

Did Trump mean what he said? Probably not. This is typical Trump fare. Say something provocative, grab some headlines, outrage your critics and thrill your fans.

Yet ironically, there is a grudging gratitude in some quarters of Nato for Mr Trump's threats when he was in the White House. Back in 2018, President Trump was so angered by the failure of several European nations to fulfil their agreed quota of spending 2% of GDP on defence that he threatened to pull the US out of the alliance altogether.

Military chiefs throughout Nato were aghast. If a US president ever went through with such a threat, abandoning Europe to fend for itself, it would so severely undermine the alliance that it would cease to exist in its present form.

But the shockwaves it sent, coupled with Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, have had the effect of prompting some, notably Germany, to promise to raise their defence spending accordingly.

Watch: Trump would not protect countries from attack by Russia if they do not pay enough into Nato

For Trump supporters, and others too, his gripe about other nations not paying their way resonates strongly. According to statistics published by Nato themselves, US military spending in 2023 amounted to 3.49% of GDP. The UK spent 2.07%, but Germany, France, Italy and Spain all came in below the agreed 2% threshold.

Tellingly, the countries closest to Russia's borders spent the most in percentage terms. There are voices in the US Republican party saying, ""Why should we, America, carry the burden of defending Europe when it won't pay for its own defence?"".

Mr Trump's throwaway comments still constitute dangerous talk at a dangerous time, for Nato and for the Western world. Ukraine's summer 2023 offensive has failed.

Russian forces remain firmly in place in the areas they have occupied and are slowly pushing back the Ukrainians in the Donbas. Moscow has moved its economy on to a war footing, allocating about 40% of national income to defence, churning out low-quality weaponry in vast numbers in the hopes of overwhelming Ukraine's defences.

Poland and the Baltic states are convinced that once President Putin has achieved his war aims in Ukraine, then Russia will rebuild its army and make a move on their countries, perhaps as soon as within three years from now.

Much faith has been placed in the long-standing deterrent value of something called Article 5. This is the part of Nato's constitution that stipulates that an attack on any member state calls for the collective defence by all.

In other words, should Moscow decide to send tanks across its borders into, say, Estonia, then this would trigger a massive response by Nato. Under a Trump presidency, that certainty would not look nearly so certain.

And thereby lies the danger in Trump's comments. If a future aggressor, be it Vladimir Putin in Europe or Xi Jinping in the South China Sea, begins to doubt Washington's commitment to defend its allies, then it risks a massive miscalculation. You don't have to look far for an example. Two years ago, President Putin's intelligence people told him the West would sit on its hands if he invaded Ukraine.","Trump on Nato: Dangerous talk at a dangerous timeBy Frank Gardner BBC security correspondentEPABritish Army soldiers on a military exercise in Estonia on 10 FebruaryAnd so it begins.

BBC

Some demonstrators supporting Imran Khan gathered in the city of Rawalpindi

Pakistan's second and third political blocs have agreed to co-operate after elections in which jailed ex-PM Imran Khan's supporters came first.

Ex-PM Nawaz Sharif's PMLN and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's PPP issued a statement saying they planned to work together to bring political stability.

If they do form a government, the move is likely to anger Mr Khan's followers.

His PTI party was barred from taking part in the election, so most of its candidates stood as independents.

Earlier, police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of Mr Khan's supporters in Rawalpindi.

According to final results, independents won 101 of the National Assembly seats. BBC analysis shows 93 of them went to PTI-backed candidates.

That puts them ahead of the PMLN, who won 75, and the PPP, who gained 54.

The two parties formed an alliance to oust Mr Khan from power in 2022 and ruled until last August.

The Karachi-based MQM party has also made a surprising return in the polls, winning 17 seats, and could play a role in any coalition.

As wrangling continues, independent candidates who did not win have flooded courts with vote-rigging allegations.

Both the PTI, which was blocked from taking part in the election, and Mr Sharif's PMLN say they want to form the next government.

The result was a surprise as most observers had expected Mr Sharif's party - widely seen as having the powerful military's backing - to win, given Mr Khan had been jailed on charges ranging from corruption to having married illegally and his party was barred from the ballot sheet.

To govern, a candidate has to show they are at the head of a coalition with a simple majority of 169 seats in the National Assembly.

Of the National Assembly's 366 seats, 266 are decided by direct voting and 70 are reserved - 60 for women and 10 for non-Muslims - and these are allocated according to the strength of each party in the assembly.

Under Pakistan's rules, independent candidates are not eligible to be allocated reserved seats in parliament.

The PTI, among several other parties, has called for protests against the results, alleging they have been rigged.

On Sunday, police blocked streets near the electoral commission building in Rawalpindi with barbed wire and large trucks, preventing any protesters from accessing it.

For about 90 minutes, a crowd of a few hundred protestors chanted on the street. Then the atmosphere turned. Police used several rounds of teargas to disperse the crowd, which then left the area.

The Punjab police told the BBC that there was a section 144 in place - a colonial-era law that stopped a gathering of more than four people.

This restriction had been put in place before the election until 12 February, but it detailed that civilians were not allowed to carry firearms, not that they were prevented from gathering.

The PTI's chairman had called for peaceful protests outside electoral commission offices where they were concerned about ""forged"" results.

Pakistani media reported that the PTI party claimed that the results of at least 18 National Assembly seats were ""falsely changed"" by election officers.

On Saturday, Mr Sharif - who is thought to be favoured by the military - called for other parties to help him form a unity government.

As negotiations got under way between Mr Khan's political rivals, experts have warned Pakistan could be facing a ""prolonged period of political instability"".

Dr Farzana Shaikh from the Chatham House think tank told the BBC that the Khan-linked independents were unlikely to be allowed to form a government and many people feared a ""weak and unstable coalition"" would result from any tie-up between Mr Sharif and the PPP.

Meanwhile, at least six PTI-backed candidates who did not win their seats have lodged legal challenges in the courts to try to get the outcome overturned.

Among them is Yasmin Rashid, who stood against Mr Sharif in Lahore.

Sarawak Report founder Clare Rewcastle Brown is the sister-in-law of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown

UK journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown has accused Malaysia of seeking ""political revenge"" for her reporting after a court jailed her in absentia.

The 64-year-old is appealing a surprise conviction for criminal defamation of a Malaysian royal handed down this week.

A local magistrates' court sentenced her to two years in prison during a single-day hearing.

Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she was being targeted after her work on the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal.

The scandal saw $4.5bn (£3.9bn) stolen from the Malaysian sovereign fund founded by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in what is thought to be the world's largest kleptocracy case.

It ensnared top Hollywood celebrities, brought down bankers from Goldman Sachs and saw the first criminal charges filed against the storied Wall Street firm.

Najib was jailed in 2022 but still faces a raft of other charges. He denies all wrongdoing.

On Wednesday the Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court ruled that Ms Rewcastle Brown criminally defamed Malaysia's former Queen Nur Zahirah in her book The Sarawak Report - The Inside Story of the 1MDB Expose.

Ms Rewcastle Brown said she was not notified in advance nor given the opportunity to defend herself in court. Her lawyers have already requested the ruling be set aside by a higher court on violations of the criminal procedure code.

""I'm afraid this is malicious, it is politically motivated. And I see it as revenge for my public interest journalism,"" she told the BBC.""I think there are a lot of very powerful and wealthy people in Malaysia who are revengeful that I identified the corruption of their former prime minister [Najib Razak], who remains popular and powerful and wealthy.

""And I think that it's no coincidence that just two or three days after [he] failed to get a pardon from the [Malaysian] King that would have let him out of jail after a fraction of his sentence, that this sentence was then passed against me"".

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described the decision to jail Rewcastle Brown as ""outrageous"" and has called on Malaysia to scrap the sentence and to ""stop harassing the journalist over her crucial reporting on the country's 1MDB scandal, recognized as one of the world's biggest-ever corruption cases"".

""The harsh ruling will deter all reporters from investigating official corruption in Malaysia and represents a clear and present danger to press freedom in the country,"" CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative Shawn Crispin said in a statement issued on Friday.

Defamation cases

Malaysia has the world's only rotating constitutional monarchy. The federal head of state changes every five years in what is a largely ceremonial role but the monarch wields significant cultural and political influence.

The oil-rich coastal state of Terengganu is home to one of the country's nine royal families. The Malay ruler is called a Sultan and his wife, a Sultanah.

Terrangganu Sultanah Nur Zahirah, who served as Malaysia's Queen from 2006-2011, has filed two defamation cases against Ms Rewcastle Brown for allegedly insinuating she was involved in corrupt practices linked to 1MDB.

The first was a civil case in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur which was dismissed by the High Court in October 2022. That was overturned on appeal and is still making its way through the courts. The second filing was the case in her local magistrates court which she has won.

Ms Rewcastle Brown said there was a misidentification error in the book that was corrected back in 2018. She also apologised for the error. But her legal team have argued that the error is not defamation, nor criminal libel.

""I do fear that there has been manipulation of this case and I do not seek to lay blame for that at the feet of the Sultanah. She was understandably annoyed,"" Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC.

Sultanah Nur Zahirah and her legal team have been approached for comment by the BBC.

Najib's reduced sentence

The former leader is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence that was halved this week by Malaysia's pardons board - a move that sends a message leaders in South East Asia can act with impunity, said James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania.

Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which previously led the ruling coalition that governed Malaysia, has been pushing for a royal pardon after testing and exhausting other legal avenues of appeal.

Najib had his sentence halved last month

Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she finds it hard to believe Najib's reduced sentence and her defamation conviction, which took place shortly afterward, are not linked.

""I have become somewhat emblematic in the eyes of those who are deeply resentful that Najib was found guilty and convicted of this crime.

""We can speculate, but I think that it's hard to come to the conclusion other than it is all connected to this 1MDB case"".

Najib's lawyers are reportedly also trying to get Netflix documentary Man On The Run about the 1MDB scandal taken down for ""sub judicial and contemptuous"" content.

He is also said to be looking to take legal action against former Malaysian attorney-general Tommy Thomas and Rewcastle-Brown over their statements in the documentary Man On The Run.

A Netflix spokesperson said they wouldn't be commenting on the matter.

Interpol involvement

Ms Rewcastle Brown also fears the Terengganu magistrates court ruling may impact her ability to travel freely.

Malaysian law enforcement officials have twice before applied for an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown on charges related to her 1MDB reporting. Interpol denied the previous two applications, she said.

It is unclear whether Malaysian authorities will pursue an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown's arrest again. The Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment.

Ms Rewcastle Brown is requesting support from the UK government and various non-governmental organisations such as the CPJ and Index on Censorship.

Born in Sarawak, Ms Rewcastle Brown has two grown sons with husband Andrew Brown, a media strategist and former journalist who is the younger brother of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

She founded investigative website Sarawak Report in 2010, which made her name as a journalist and environmental campaigner focused on corruption in the lucrative palm oil trade.

She hopes to one day return to Malaysia without the threat of imprisonment.

""I will just keep going,"" she said. ""I'm just one of many, many journalists campaigning to support the right of journalists to do their job, which is to bring information in the public interest to the wider audience.""

Herbert Wigwe was widely seen as an industry leader

The co-founder of Access Bank, one of the largest banks in Nigeria, was among six people killed in a helicopter crash in California on Friday.

Herbert Wigwe, his wife, son, and a former president of the Nigerian stock exchange were all killed in the crash.

President Bola Tinubu described the death of Mr Wigwe as an ""overwhelming tragedy"".

Investigators are scouring the site in southern Californian desert to determine the cause of the crash.

The chartered helicopter was on its way from from Palm Springs to Boulder City in Nevada when it went down about 96km (60 miles) from Las Vegas.

According to Nigerian media, the 57-year-old banker was on his way to Las Vegas to attend Sunday's Super Bowl.

The San Bernardino county sheriff's department said the crash site was near Nipton, on the edge of the Mojave Desert Preserve. The weather was poor, with reports of rain and snow showers in the area.

Mr Wigwe founded Access Bank in 1989. It became the largest bank in Nigeria in 2018 after it acquired its main competitor, Diamond Bank.

In recent years, Mr Wigwe had been working to expand across the continent, acquiring banks in countries including Kenya, South Africa and Botswana.

He was planning to open a new banking service in Asia in the first quarter of 2024.

Tributes have been pouring in following the news of his death. President Tinubu said it was ""shocking beyond comprehension"". The president's office described his death as ""a terrible blow"" for Nigeria and Africa's banking industry.

Goma's population has swelled in recent days as people arrive by motorbike and foot fleeing advancing fighters

Emile Bolingo is not sure how long he and other residents of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, can hold out.

This major city in the region, with about two million people, has been cut off from the farms that feed it for several days.

It is the latest episode in a resurgence of fighting that has seen tens of thousands added to the nearly seven million who have been forced from their homes in the country because of multiple conflicts.

Rebels from the ethnic Tutsi-led M23 movement are blocking the two main roads into Goma from the north and the west and preventing produce from getting through.

""We are scared of going hungry if the [Congolese army] do not liberate any of the main roads very soon. You can feel the panic here… people are very scared,"" Mr Bolingo told the BBC.

Goma's population has swelled in recent days with people running from the advancing fighters.

Mundeke Kandundao, a motorbike taxi rider, has just undergone surgery after a bomb blast

Sake, a town 25km (15 miles) north-west of Goma, came under attack on Wednesday.

""I sustained a pelvic injury caused by shrapnel,"" Mundeke Kandundao told the BBC from his hospital bed in Goma where he has undergone surgery.

The 25-year-old motorbike taxi driver said a shell was launched by the rebels from a hill overlooking the town on Wednesday.

""I was standing behind a cabin and there were a lot of other people there and that's where it exploded,"" he said.

""We are scared because you know the war goes on and on, it is meaningless. We are waiting to see if it ends so that we can go back to our homes.""

Laurent Cresci, from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told the BBC from the state-run Bethsaida Hospital in Goma that patient numbers had surged on Wednesday: ""It was really a mass casualty. We were before 80 patients in our ward, and now we have 130 patients so it's really hard to manage.""

For many people it is a tragic case of déjà vu.

""For how long shall we live like this? Every now and then we keep fleeing,"" Pascal Bashali told the BBC after he had arrived in Goma. People are streaming in by foot, on motorbikes and mini buses.

Aline Ombeni said she was distraught on her arrival in the city: ""We have fled empty-handed just as you are seeing us - no food, no clothes we need help with shelter and food.""

M23 fighters are well equipped, but the group denies being a Rwanda proxy

As the conflict edges closer, it brings back memories of 2012 when the rebels occupied the lakeside city for 10 days before abandoning it following international pressure.

The M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. UN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.

""We all know that the reason of this war is economic. Rwanda is continuing... for the past 25 years… looting our mineral resources,"" Congolese Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya told the BBC, urging the UK to use its influence with Rwanda to ease the situation.

There are now fears that the M23 - by far the most organised, disciplined and well-equipped of the many militia groups in the region - could capture Goma once again.

Recently re-elected Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi last year said that ""Congolese need to learn to trust us, Goma will never fall"". He repeated the promise, in the city itself, during the election campaign in December.

Within reach of major mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand such as gold, tin and coltan, Goma has become a vital economic hub. Its road and air transport links, and the fact that it has a huge UN peacekeeping base, has attracted a host of businesses, international organisations and diplomatic consulates.

As such, Goma is a valuable strategic target, but the M23 says it does not want to capture it and maintains it is on the defensive not offensive.

""If you see the military power of the M23, they could take Goma if they wanted to, but this could bring them many problems,"" said Onesphore Sematumba, a DR Congo analyst at the International Crisis Group thinktank.

The rebels may just be displaying their capabilities, and also thinking back to 2012 and the international opprobrium that followed the seizing of Goma then.

In the aftermath of its withdrawal it suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army backed by a multinational force that saw it expelled from the country. M23 fighters then agreed to be re-integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected.

But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken.

It emerged from the mountain forests on the border between DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda and edged closer to Goma taking swathes of territory.

Ceasefires have been agreed, but these have all broken down, with the government and the M23 blaming each other.

The M23 has repeatedly said it still wants peace negotiations with Kinshasa.

""We asked for the dialogue to resolve this problem peacefully,"" M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka told the BBC. ""Many cycles of war… don't resolve the root causes of conflict. The Congolese government itself doesn't want that, it wants to go on a war, and kill people even more.""

President Tshisekedi has said talks are ""out of question"".

""One thing must be clear is that we as government, we will never negotiate with M23. M23 doesn't exist. It's Rwanda acting with its puppet,"" his communications minister told the BBC.

Reuters

Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled their villages to live in makeshift camps; some are on the move again

Last year, an East African force, which was in DR Congo to help protect civilians and secure areas that armed groups had withdrawn from, left the country at the government's request.

Its departure in December was followed by the end of the latest ceasefire and the recent upsurge in activity by the M23.

President Tshisekedi hopes that a southern African force that recently arrived in its place will have more success as it has a mandate to attack rebel groups.

He has also asked the large UN force in the country, known as Monusco, to leave. It has become increasingly unpopular for its failure to end the conflict during its 25-year deployment.

But there are concerns that the conflict could get even worse after the Congolese president threatened in December to declare war on Rwanda if the rebels attack again.

In an apparent reply to the remarks, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said in January that in defending his country ""we will fight like people who have nothing to lose"".

Meanwhile, Natàlia Torrent, from medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has warned that the intensification of fighting in ""different areas and on different fronts"" since mid-January is having a devastating effect on an already vulnerable population.

""We are in an area that has been already prone to the spread of different epidemics. We have been already working in the last year on cholera or measles and we are afraid... [a] new wave of epidemics are going to surge again,"" she told the BBC.

Reflecting on the fighting, Goma resident Mr Bolingo added: ""We are the ones who suffer.""

Mr Bashali, who fled from Sake with his wife and nine children, agreed: ""Men are dying, children are dying, women are dying, those fighting are dying, what for? We are praying that our country will be peaceful.""","Rebels from the ethnic Tutsi-led M23 movement are blocking the two main roads into Goma from the north and the west and preventing produce from getting through.

By Sofia Ferreira Santos BBC News

VATICAN/EPA

The occasion marked the first meeting between Argentina's President Javier Milei and Pope Francis

Argentina's first female saint was canonised on Sunday, in an event which brought Pope Francis and the country's president face-to-face for the first time.

President Javier Milei, a libertarian, had previously said the Pope was an ""imbecile"" who ""promotes communism"".

He has since toned down his criticism after taking office in December.

Mr Milei travelled to the Vatican for the Mass at St Peter's Basilica, where he met and hugged the 87-year-old Pope.

They will meet again in a private audience at the Vatican on Monday.

María Antonia de Paz y Figueroa, known as Mama Antula, was an 18th-Century laywoman who is considered by some to be Argentina's first feminist.

She renounced her family's riches to minister to the poor, and helped keep the Jesuit movement alive in Argentina after the religious order - to which the Pope belongs - was suppressed.

The Pope described her on Friday as a ""gift to the Argentine people and also to the entire Church"".

The meeting between the political and religious leaders comes amid major political uncertainty in Argentina - where inflation has soared to 200% and 40% of the population lives in poverty.

Thousands of Argentines have protested against Mr Milei's economic policies, which include deep spending cuts and a 50% devaluation of the Argentine peso.

He has also announced plans to slash workers' rights, abolish rent caps and remove government subsidies on everyday items.

Mr Milei has said the country needs ""economic shock therapy"" to fix its current economic crisis, deemed the worst in decades.

Shortly after his election win in November, Mr Milei invited the Pope - whom he addressed as ""Your Holiness"" - to visit Argentina in 2024.","Pope and Milei meet as Argentina gains first female saintBy Sofia Ferreira Santos BBC NewsVATICAN/EPAThe occasion marked the first meeting between Argentina's President Javier Milei and Pope FrancisArgentina's first female saint was canonised on Sunday, in an event which brought Pope Francis and the country's president face-to-face for the first time.

They also gave free jerseys to all 14,000 season-ticket members, which resulted in retail sales being ""off the chart"" as everyone else in the city saw the jerseys and wanted to be a part of it, especially as the team kept winning.

""Something really unique and special happened, a bond formed really quickly,"" Bubolz says. ""In a strange way, the tragedy brought us together. In despair came a connection, and people fell in love with these players.""

By Mike Wendling BBC News

Jack Sweeney

Jack Sweeney insists that he means no harm against those whose planes he tracks

A university student from Florida has made a habit of getting under the skin of some of the world's richest and most powerful people. How? By telling the rest of us where their private planes are - and how much carbon they emit.

Jack Sweeney would like to clarify a few details. For one thing, he thinks Taylor Swift has some good tunes.

However, he believes - despite the threat of legal action - that anybody should be able to see where her private jet is headed, and how often it flies.

""I like to be fair,"" he told the BBC in an email. ""I try to share everyone's info no matter who it is.""

But it is specifically information about the locations of private planes of the rich and powerful - posted to his social media accounts - that has repeatedly made the 21-year-old the subject of news stories and legal threats.

Mr Sweeney is the son of an airline maintenance operations controller and a teacher, and grew up in the suburbs of Orlando. He says he has always had an interest in aviation and technology, and particularly in Elon Musk's SpaceX and Tesla companies.

Those interests gradually led him to develop a plane tracking website, TheAirTraffic.com, and social media accounts which track the aircraft of celebrities, politicians, tycoons and Russian oligarchs.

The system relies on publicly available data collected by amateur enthusiasts. Aeroplanes in the sky regularly send out information about where they are located, and these signals can be picked up by people using inexpensive receivers on the ground.

This thriving cohort of online plane trackers is part of the larger Osint (open-source intelligence) community, populated by people who delve into masses of freely available online data looking for incriminating, insightful or just plain interesting nuggets of information. It is a motley crew that includes a range of individuals - from the mildly curious to dedicated researchers and committed investigative journalists.

""Originally I was just kind of doing this as a hobby as I found it interesting,"" said Mr Sweeney, who is currently in his third year of an information technology degree at the University of Central Florida.

As time has gone by, he has found a more defined purpose. He says he believes ""in the importance of transparency and public information"".

And there is an environmental angle: ""The flyers are trying to hide the bad PR of [carbon] emissions.""

His data has been used in studies showing the huge carbon footprint of Ms Swift and her entourage. The singer says she has bought enough carbon offsets to cancel out emissions from her latest tour twice over.

But there are also privacy issues at stake. Ms Swift, through her lawyers, contends that revealing the location of her private plane puts her at risk from stalkers.

In a letter first revealed by the Washington Post, lawyers for the singer wrote that plane tracking was a ""life-or-death matter"" and there was ""no legitimate interest in or public need for this information, other than to stalk, harass, and exert dominion and control"".

Mr Sweeney rejects those assertions and says there is a fundamental public interest in locating the pop star's plane. His proof? Swifties themselves.

""Her fans, who have grown the TaylorSwiftJets accounts and subreddit, are the ones truly interested,"" he says. ""These tracking accounts consistently have more supporters and fans [than detractors].""

Taylor Swift performing Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome

And given world tours and numerous public appearances - including recently at marquee NFL games - it is usually fairly easy to figure out where Ms Swift will be at some point in the future.

Over the past fortnight, for instance, numerous stories have been published outlining how she might be able to travel between two pressing engagements - her Saturday night show in Tokyo and Sunday's Super Bowl in Las Vegas.

Much of this public information is more granular than the location of a plane. Flight data can show who owns an aircraft and where it is in the sky, but not who is on it, or where those people travel to after the plane lands.

But Ms Swift's representatives say the plane information gives exact times and locations of her movements, and notes that one alleged stalker was recently arrested outside her New York home. Her publicist Tree Paine said in a statement: ""His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be.""

Mr Sweeney also had some advice for the star - gently suggesting that if privacy is her top concern, she could register her private jet through an anonymous corporate entity and perhaps choose an identification code that does not include her birthday and initials.

James Slater, Mr Sweeney's lawyer, says that he does not expect Ms Swift to take any further legal action.

""The letter was an attempt to bully Jack into doing something that legally he doesn't have to do,"" he said. ""Unfortunately folks with power and money often do this.

""He's not doing anything unlawful.""

Ms Swift's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

One question is whether the Swift fandom will still follow Mr Sweeney's accounts after the latest news.

After the story broke about the legal letter, there was a flurry of online chatter about the case. It included support for Mr Sweeney but also sentiments such as: ""Jack Sweeney wants Taylor Swift to die like Princess Diana. I'm not letting this go. I'm so angry.""

But it is not the first time Mr Sweeney has been on the receiving end of pressure from the rich and famous.

Most notably, when he purchased Twitter (now X) in 2022, Elon Musk vowed in the name of free speech not to take action against Mr Sweeney's @elonjet tracking account.

In a matter of weeks, however, Mr Musk reversed course, banned the account and threatened to sue, claiming that @elonjet resulted in a stalker tracking him down and climbing on top of his craft when his small child was inside.

Police later identified a member of Mr Musk's security team as a suspect, and said that Mr Sweeney's account had nothing to do with the incident.

TheAirTraffic/Jack Sweeney

A screenshot from Jack Sweeney's website TheAirTraffic.com

Mr Sweeney now runs an account that tracks Mr Musk's jet with a 24-hour delay, in order to comply with a site rule banning real-time location tracking.

He also runs accounts on several social media sites keeping track of planes owned by Kim Kardashian, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Donald Trump and others.

But he expressed frustration at the vagaries of social media rules, noting that Meta has suspended the Facebook and Instagram accounts tracking Ms Swift's plane, but has left up various other plane tracking accounts - including the ones which track Mr Zuckerberg's aircraft.

The BBC has contacted Meta for comment.

Meanwhile the planespotters who chat on Mr Sweeney's server on the Discord site have defended his stance - along with their enthusiasm for their hobby. And some admitted they, too, are fans of Ms Swift.

""I have no doubt crazy people have sent her wild threats,"" said one commenter, ""but the airport is not the place where she is vulnerable.""","Mr Sweeney is the son of an airline maintenance operations controller and a teacher, and grew up in the suburbs of Orlando.

American voters, including many Democrats, have consistently raised Joe Biden's age as one of their biggest concerns about the 81-year-old president ahead of November's election.

Now a special counsel report into Mr Biden's handling of classified documents has thrust the issue centre stage.

Robert Hur's inquiry concluded that the president had ""wilfully retained and disclosed"" classified files after leaving office as vice-president in 2017 - but the prosecutor declined to bring criminal charges.

His report did cause political damage, however, with its repeated references to Mr Biden's memory, and his alleged inability to recall key events and dates.

We asked members of our panel of US voters - especially those who say they might vote for the president - for their reaction to the report.

Bessy is a liberal who has concerns over backing Biden again due to his strong support for Israel and the situation in Gaza.

The memory issues that were brought up in the report are extremely alarming.

I think most Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, were already having mixed feelings about our aging government. While I voted for Biden in the 2020 election, I am on the fence about his age going into the next four years.

These findings confirm that Democrats need to present another presidential candidate or they risk losing the presidency to Donald Trump.

A lot of younger voters voted for Biden due to a lack of choice. I think he owes his party and country the chance to move in a new direction with a different candidate.

He needs to see that Republican voters aren't the only ones that are concerned with his age.

John voted for the libertarian candidate in 2016 and voted for Biden in 2020 because he did not like Trump.

This report confirms what many people already knew: that President Biden is getting up there in age and his memory is not what it used to be.

Frankly, I don't think he has the stamina or memory for the job anymore. I'm still going to vote for him in November, but at this point I really feel like I'd be voting for Vice-President Kamala Harris.

As someone who used to work extensively with classified information, I am extremely troubled by how our elected politicians keep treating these documents. If I wilfully kept classified information like Donald Trump or misplaced reams of classified documents as has President Biden, I would have lost my clearance, my job, and potentially, my freedom.

I believe it is absolutely fair for the special counsel to bring up these examples as they highlight the president's inability to safeguard information pertaining to national security.

Pandem would prefer to see a younger, fresher face as the Democratic candidate, but says the report does not change his opinion of Biden.

My biggest takeaway from the report was that I think the special counsel presented the difference between how Biden and Trump handled it - cooperation versus staunch opposition - in terms clear enough to at least mute the argument that Biden should be charged too.

I don't think it was fair for Hur to use those [memory] examples or to even mention in the report that he felt a jury would perceive Biden as an elderly man with memory problems.

I think even including that statement gave political ammunition to Biden's critics as sort of a consolation prize because he [Hur] couldn't, in good faith or legal standing, press charges.

It would have been better for Hur to say ""I don't believe it likely to persuade a jury that President Biden had any malicious intent in retaining these documents"".

As of now, I plan to vote for Joe Biden in November. He's not the ideal candidate but I will vote for him as opposed to Trump.

A conservative voter, Luke wants a Republican alternative to Trump this time, but says he will ultimately vote for the former president if he is on November's ballot.

This report is further evidence that the sitting president of the United States is alarmingly incompetent, a situation that should be viewed as a serious threat to national security.

Not only was it fair for Hur to bring up these examples, it was necessary for him to do so, as he explained that a jury would likely not be able to convict Biden due to his debilitated mental condition.

That said, this development does not change much for me - I would not have voted for Biden anyway. But it strengthens my belief that he will not actually be on the ticket in November - the Democratic National Committee and its donor base will replace him.

Sandra is worried by the prospect of Trump returning to the White House - and dismisses the focus on Biden's age and memory.

The biggest takeaway for me was the media bias regarding the justice department report.

The fact that President Biden was shown to have done nothing approaching the level of criminal - no indictment will be coming - is being ignored.

This exoneration of the president was no surprise. President Biden cooperated immediately and voluntarily sat for hours of interviews that covered four decades of his career.

The report does not change how I feel about him. He's doing a masterful job leading this country through some turbulent times. My vote this November will be for President Biden, and I'm trying to tune out attacks that will only escalate as we near the election.

By Jeremy Bowen BBC international editor, Jerusalem

BBC

I'd rather be writing this story in the Gaza Strip, not Jerusalem. After many years of covering wars, since El Salvador in 1989, I'm convinced that nothing beats first-hand reporting.

Unfortunately, in this terrible war, international journalists can't do that. Israel and Egypt, the two countries that control Gaza's borders, do not want us in there, reporting freely. Israel allows some closely supervised visits with its army. I have been on only one, back in November.

Since we cannot get in, we rely on Palestinian journalists who can't get out. I have huge admiration for their courage and dedication to truthful reporting.

Fortunately, in the modern world it is impossible to seal a war off. That is because ordinary people can film with a phone - and with a few clicks, post their pictures online. We can talk to them too, if communications haven't been cut. Israel and Hamas upload their own videos. Everything must be verified and checked, especially now that artificial intelligence is much easier to use.

With all those constraints in mind, this is how the war looks on a February day from Jerusalem.

The humanitarian crisis

Just after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defence minister, announced: ""We are putting a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed.""

""We are fighting human animals,"" he added, ""and we are acting accordingly.""

Under pressure from US President Joe Biden, Israel now allows limited supplies of food, water and medicine into Gaza. Aid agencies and the UN cite considerable evidence that Israeli security checks slow the supply of relief into Gaza, and that Israel restricts the movement of relief convoys inside the Strip. Very little medical and food aid has reached northern Gaza this year.

In response to this article, the Israeli embassy in London said claims by UN agencies about the food situation in Gaza were inaccurate and ""constitute support of Hamas propaganda"". Israel says that if aid is not getting through, it's because of the UN and aid agencies on the ground. The statement added that ""Hamas steals aid from the residents of Gaza"".

After four months of war, law and order in Gaza is in fragments. Aid convoys are looted every day. Sunday 11 February was the worse day of looting so far in the south, according to the UN. It said what's left of the local police force stopped protecting convoys after eight of their men were killed in Israeli raids.

Because we are not permitted to enter Gaza, we cannot check Israel's claims that Hamas is stealing the food.

The UN's prime suspects are criminal gangs who sell it on. Judging by the few videos of looting that have emerged, desperate individuals are doing it too.

""I don't know who they are,"" Jamie McGoldrick, the UN's humanitarian coordinator told me. ""They're young guys, not in uniforms. They just come here and they stop us and take stuff off the back. And it turns up in the market sometimes. I wouldn't mind if desperate people got to use it but you see some stuff in the market which has been taken off our trucks."" Mr McGoldrick said it was getting impossible to operate in such a lawless environment.

Israel is increasingly sensitive about accusations that it is responsible for the suffering of civilians in Gaza, because of pressure from its allies, especially the US, and the genocide case it is facing at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Later this month, it has to show the court that it has improved conditions for non-combatants in Gaza.

International aid groups say on top of the fact that innocent civilians in Gaza are being killed and wounded, they are also being starved and deprived of medical treatment. The Geneva Convention says that punishing civilians for crimes they did not commit amounts to collective punishment, which is a war crime.

The Americans have since 7 October urged Israel to respect the laws of war in Gaza, specifically to stop killing so many Palestinian civilians. The fact that American officials, from President Biden downwards, keep repeating and strengthening their criticisms shows they believe Israel has ignored them.

On his visit here this week, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued his most stinging public criticism yet of Israel's conduct of the war. The brutality of Hamas attacks on Israel, he said, cannot be used to justify brutalising Palestinians.

""Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,"" he told a news conference in Tel Aviv. ""The hostages have been dehumanised every day since. But that cannot be a license to dehumanise others.""

""The overwhelming majority of people in Gaza had nothing to do with the attacks of October 7,"" Mr Blinken went on. ""The families in Gaza whose survival depends on deliveries of aid from Israel are just like our families. They're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, who want to earn a decent living, send their kids to school, have a normal life. That's who they are. That's what they want.""

Even so, the US has chosen not to attach conditions to its huge military and diplomatic support for Israel. It continues to supply Israel with weapons, even though it does not approve of the way that they are being used.

Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of UNRWA, the UN agency that is leading the humanitarian operation in Gaza, issued his own warning about the long-term consequences of the war for young people in Gaza when I spoke to him this week.

""I'm extremely worried,"" he said. ""They're all deeply traumatised by this unprecedented war. They're living in absolutely miserable conditions. Now, if the war ends tomorrow, our first priority should be to find ways to bring these children back into an education system… [or] we will just be sowing the seed of more resentment and hate in the future.""

Bruno Boelpaep/BBC News

Jeremy Bowen speaking to Philippe Lazzarini

Israel will not be impressed by Mr Lazzarini's comments. It has made serious allegations against UNRWA, accusing it of aiding and abetting Hamas. Mr Lazzarini has been fighting to save the agency since Israel presented a dossier to the Americans saying about a dozen UNRWA staff took part in the 7 October attacks.

UNRWA sacked the accused men and is trying to reassure the 16 major donor countries who have suspended its funding. Mr Lazzarini says he takes the allegations very seriously, is determined to root out any Hamas sympathisers, but Israel still has not given him the dossier it sent to the US. Israel believes UNRWA is rotten to the core. The crisis surrounding the agency is without a doubt another impediment to the aid operation.

Northern Gaza is virtually inaccessible for the UN and other aid organisations. Information has trickled out, with local people living in the ruins reporting general starvation and widespread malnutrition among children that is likely to have life-long health consequences for those who survive.

We get more information from southern Gaza, where getting on for two million people are trying to stay alive. Some 1.4 million are in Rafah, hard up against the Egyptian border wire. Most people live in tents made of plastic sheeting, next to pools of sewage.

Unlike journalists, aid workers from the organisations involved in the relief effort can go in and out of Gaza. I've spoken to a range of UN officials with decades of experience in war zones. All have said it is the worst they have ever seen. One told me: ""I've never seen anything of this size and scale and depth.""

Another said Gaza was the most dangerous and difficult place he had ever been, not just because of Israeli bombing, but because law and order had broken down. He said: ""There are many guns in Gaza, but as well as that, there are lots of big angry men with clubs."" The UN was moving aid convoys in the small hours of the morning to stop them being robbed.

The war in Gaza

Palestinians in Rafah are approaching panic about a ground assault into the town by Israeli troops. A colleague from BBC Arabic spoke to Jabr al-Burdini, a middle-aged man in Rafah who had just been digging dead children out of the ruins of a neighbour's house.

""If there were Israeli operations here, thousands of people would be killed. The kids are terrified and so are the adults. Look at the children. They can't sleep.""

A view over Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip

Mr Lazzarini told me that a major Israeli assault on Rafah would ""add an additional apocalyptic layer in the Gaza Strip"".

He said that some 5% of the population - about 100,000 people - had in the last four months either been killed, wounded or had disappeared, most likely dead under the rubble.

""And then you have the rest of the population now being concentrated almost in the open air in Rafah. And then you conduct a military operation in this place, you can only add an additional disastrous layer of tragedy. And this needs absolutely to be avoided.""

Air strikes already kill many people in Rafah, but despite American calls for restraint, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ordered the army to attack the town once it has a plan to move Palestinian civilians out of Rafah. Since nowhere in Gaza is safe, residents do not find that reassuring. Perhaps Mr Netanyahu is trying to mollify Mr Biden.

Another potential audience might be the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which has ruled that Israel faces ""plausible"" allegations that it is committing the crime of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has set a high bar for victory that might be unattainable, even over many months. It wants to wipe out Hamas, restore Israel's security and free the hostages Hamas took on 7 October. Many of the families of Israelis held in Gaza and their supporters do not buy the prime minister's argument that only force will free the hostages. They want a ceasefire deal, as they fear that the longer the war continues, the less likely it is that they will ever see them again.

Israel has inflicted considerable damage on Hamas, but it has not broken its capacity to fight. A senior Western intelligence official told me that Israel had killed about one-third of Hamas forces and destroyed about one-third of the tunnel network that makes Hamas such an obdurate enemy.

Mr Netanyahu has also said Israel would like to kill Hamas leaders, starting with Yahya Sinwar, the man who it is believed instigated and directed the 7 October attacks. So far, Mr Sinwar and his closest lieutenants are believed to be alive, perhaps living in the tunnel network shielded by Israeli hostages.

The war in the wider Middle East

In four months, the shockwaves of the war in Gaza have spread out across the Middle East. Iran's network of allies, which it calls the axis of resistance, is engaged in the wider war.

After three US soldiers were killed in Jordan by a militia trained and funded by Iran, the US started a rolling programme of air strikes in Syria and Iraq. With the UK, it has also bombed the Houthis in Yemen who are attacking shipping in the Red Sea. Hawks in the US and Israel want the American military to bomb Iran.

The Houthis and Iran's other allies and proxies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. The most powerful ally of Iran is Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its border war with Israel is getting more serious and more intense by the day. Pressure is growing inside Israel to send troops into southern Lebanon.

The Americans are trying to construct a path to a peaceful future in the Middle East. Secretary of State Blinken has laid out a vision of Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel, if the Israelis allow the Palestinians to have an independent state of their own. Prime Minister Netanyahu says Palestinian independence will not happen.

It was March 2022. The Russian rouble crashed, the value in London of corporate giants Gazprom and Sberbank fell 97%. Queues began to form at cash machines in Moscow. Oligarchs' yachts, football teams, mansions and even their credit cards were seized.

Russia crashed into a major recession.

This was the immediate result of the most extraordinary attempt by the West at financial containment of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

At its heart was the seizing of the Russian state's official foreign exchange assets and, in particular, the unprecedented freezing of the central bank's $300bn (£238bn) in reserves.

Western governments pointedly shied away from using phrases like ""economic war"", but it certainly seemed like there was a financial theatre of battle with the Kremlin. It was better than the alternative of direct confrontation between nuclear states.

Some two years on and there is quite a change in this economic backdrop.

In a long and rambling interview this week, President Putin gleefully exclaimed Russia as the fastest growing economy in Europe.

Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) underlined the resilience of the Russian economy when it upgraded its forecast growth for this year to 2.6% from 1.1%.

Based on the IMF's figures, the Russian economy grew faster than the whole G7 last year, and will do so again in 2024.

These are not just numbers. The stalemate in Ukraine last year and the growing expectation of a frozen conflict on the ground across this year, has been underpinned by Russia's remobilisation of its economy to its military effort, especially in the construction of defensive lines in the east and south of Ukraine.

Western leaders argue that this model is utterly unsustainable over the medium term. But the question is - for how long it can sustain?

Russia has transformed its economy into a mobilised war economy. The Russian state is spending a record in the post-Soviet era.

Military and security spending at up to 40% of the budget is back to late-Soviet era levels. Other areas of state support to the population have been squeezed to make up for funding the production of tanks, missile systems and those defences in occupied Ukraine.

On top of that, despite Western restrictions on Russian oil and gas, the flows of hydrocarbon revenues have kept coming into the state coffers.

The tankers are now going to India and China and more of the payments are in Chinese yuan rather than the US dollar.

Russian oil production remains at 9.5 million barrels per day, barely down on pre-war levels. The country has skirted sanctions by buying and deploying a ""shadow fleet"" of hundreds of tankers.

Last week, its finance ministry reported that hydrocarbon taxes in January exceeded levels seen in January 2022, just before the invasion.

The ongoing flow of foreign exchange into Russian oil, gas, and diamonds has also helped alleviate the stress on the value of the rouble.

Western leaders are adamant that this cannot last, but recognise its impact.

One world leader recently said privately: ""2024 will be much more positive for Putin than we thought. He has managed to reorganise his own industry more efficiently than we thought.""

Russia exposed

But this form of economic growth has greatly increased Moscow's dependence on oil revenues, on China and on non-productive war spending.

As demand for oil and gas peaks, and competitor production from the Arabian Gulf comes on-stream in the coming year, Russia will be exposed.

Reuters

Russia's spending on the war has lifted GDP, but as vehicles are destroyed, the boost is unsustainable

Statistical rises in gross domestic product (GDP) from the production of tanks and shells that are then blown up in the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, are also far from productive.

Meanwhile, Russia has experienced a brain drain of some of its most talented citizens.

The Western strategy has been not to lay siege to Russia's economy, but to engage in a cat and mouse game to restrict access to technology, raise costs, limit revenues and make the conflict unsustainable long-term.

""We'd rather Russia uses its money to buy tankers [for oil] than tanks"" one US official told me. In the oil market, the aim of policy is not to try to prevent India, for example, from buying Russian oil but to limit the profits from that trade going back to the Kremlin war machine.

But this resilience and stalemate can last the rest of this year at least. It feeds into the clear strategy in the Kremlin of waiting for a possible change of US president and a reduction of Western funding for Ukraine's defence.

That is why attention is now turning back to the central role of those hundreds of billions in frozen Russian financial assets.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told me last month: ""If the world has $300bn, why not use it?"" All of those frozen funds should be deployed to fund Ukraine's rebuilding effort, he said.

Getty Images

Ukraine's President Zelensky has asked that billions of dollars of frozen Russian assets be used to help his country

The UK's Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Foreign Secretary David Cameron back the move.

Lord Cameron told me: ""We've frozen these assets. The question is are we going to use them?""

He said ""using some of this money now is if you like an advance payment on [Russian] reparations"" for its illegal invasion of Ukraine, and could be used ""to help Ukraine and save Western taxpayers money at the same time"".

The G7 has asked its central bankers to come up with a technical and legal analysis. Central bankers are understood to be uneasy. One top financier told me there would be risks to what he called ""weaponising the dollar"". Traditionally, central banks enjoy sovereign immunity from these sorts of actions.

A plan being developed would use the funds, or the profits from the investments to raise tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine.

But it is a balancing act. If Russian assets are seized in this way, then what message does it send to other nations, perhaps in the Gulf, or Central Asia, or Africa, about the safety of their safe-haven reserves in Western central banks?

These relationships are some of the central arteries of global finance, recycling hundreds of billions of dollars used to pay for energy, across the world. Putin certainly wished to communicate that China was now emerging as an alternative, if not for the West, then for emerging economies.

The Russians have also indicated that they will take court action over any seizure, and in turn take similar assets from Western companies frozen in Russian banks.

So the shadow battle over Russia's economy is essential to understanding where this conflict and the world economy, is going.

Russia's war economy can not sustain long-term, but has bought the country some extra time. The West is about to up the ante, after Russia displayed this unexpected resilience.","Faisal Islam: Russia’s war economy cannot last but has bought timeBy Faisal Islam Economics editor @faisalislamReutersIt was March 2022.

By Ido Vock BBC News

Reuters

Mr Putin began the interview by claiming that 862 was the year of the ""establishment of the Russian state""

US talk show host Tucker Carlson's interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin began with a rambling half-hour lecture on the history of Russia and Ukraine.

Mr Carlson, frequently appearing bemused, listened as Mr Putin expounded at length about the origins of Russian statehood in the ninth century, Ukraine as an artificial state and Polish collaboration with Hitler.

It is familiar ground for Mr Putin, who infamously penned a 5,000-word essay entitled ""On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians"" in 2021, which foreshadowed the intellectual justification the Kremlin offered for its invasion of Ukraine less than a year later.

Historians say the litany of claims made by Mr Putin are nonsense - representing nothing more than a selective abuse of history to justify the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Regardless of the historical realities, none of Putin's assertions would form a legal justification for his invasion.

A state-centred narrative

Mr Putin began the interview by claiming that 862 was the year of the ""establishment of the Russian state"". This was the year that Rurik, a Scandinavian prince, was invited to rule over the city of Novgorod, the capital of the Rus - the people who would eventually develop into today's Russians.

Mr Putin contrasts what he claims is the unbroken tradition of Russian statehood dating back to the 9th Century with the modern ""invention"" of Ukraine - a country he insists was ""created"" as late as the 20th Century.

But Sergey Radchenko, a historian at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, says the president's claim is ""a complete falsehood"".

""Vladimir Putin is trying to construct a narrative backwards, saying Russia as a state began its development in the 9th Century. You could equally say that Ukraine as a state began its development in the 9th Century, exactly with the same kind of evidence and documents.

""He's trying to use certain historical facts to construct a state-centred narrative that would favour Russia as opposed to any alternative agglomerations.""

Ronald Suny, a professor at the University of Michigan, says the Rus was made up of ""a bunch of bandits, who burned their own capital repeatedly"".

He adds that Mr Putin is repeating an ""established mythology made up at certain points in the past by Muscovite tsars who trace their lineage back to Rurik.""

""This mythology was crystallised in Moscow to justify their imperial hold over Ukraine.""

A 'special ethnic group'

Mr Putin told Tucker Carlson that by the 17th Century, when Poland came to rule over parts of present-day Ukraine, they introduced the idea that the population of those areas ""was not exactly Russians. Because they lived on the fringe, they were Ukrainians.""

""Originally the word Ukrainian meant that the person was living on the outskirts of the state, along the fringes.""

But Anita Prazmowska, a professor emerita at the LSE, says that although a national consciousness emerged later among Ukrainians than other central European nations, there were Ukrainians during that period.

""[Vladimir Putin] is using a 20th Century concept of the state based on the protection of a defined nation, as something that goes back. It doesn't.""

Mr Suny says that while it may be true that Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians ""came from the same stock … through time, they developed into different peoples.""

'New Russia'

Mr Putin claims that areas in the south and east of Ukraine ""had no historical connection with Ukraine whatsoever"". Conquered from the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empress Catherine the Great in the 17th Century, the Russian president says that means these lands are in fact rightfully Russian. Mr Putin later refers to them using the 18th Century term ""Novorossiya"" - New Russia.

Mr Suny points out that the inhabitants of these lands when they were conquered by Russia were neither Russian nor Ukrainian, but Ottoman, Tatar or Cossacks - Slavic peasants who had fled to the frontiers.

Catherine the Great conquered parts of present-day Ukraine

But claiming that these territories are in reality rightfully Russian serves Mr Putin's interests, as they are precisely the areas that Russia is attempting to conquer from Ukraine during the now decade-long conflict with its neighbour.

So-called Novorossiya includes Crimea - illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. New Russia also covers areas around Kherson, Mariupol and Bakhmut, which Mr Putin declared part of Russia in 2022.

An 'artificial state'

Mr Putin went on to claim that ""Ukraine is an artificial state that was shaped at [Joseph] Stalin's will,"" arguing that Ukraine was created by the Soviet leadership in the 1920s and received lands to which it had no historical claim.

In a sense, he is correct, says Prof Radchenko. The Soviet leadership drew up the borders of Soviet republics ""almost like the Western colonial powers drew up borders in Africa - kind of randomly.""

""But that does not mean that Ukrainians did not exist.""

More broadly, Mr Radchenko denies Mr Putin's claims that Ukraine is not a real country because it was formed in its modern form in the 20th Century. ""Any country is a fake country, in the sense that countries are created as a result of a historical process.""

""Russia was created as a result of decisions taken by the Russian tsars, such as the colonisation of Siberia, which came at the considerable expense of the local population.

""If Ukraine is a fake country, then so is Russia.""

'Collaborating with Hitler'

Perhaps Mr Putin's most inflammatory claim was regarding Poland. Mr Putin claimed that Poland - which was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 - ""collaborated with Hitler"".

The Russian president told his interviewer that by refusing to cede an area of Poland called the Danzig Corridor to Hitler, Poland ""went too far, pushing Hitler to start World War Two by attacking them"".

For Prof Prazmowska, President Putin's interpretation of history is a flawed reading of the historical record. She says that while it is true that there were diplomatic contacts between Poland and the Nazis - the first treaty Hitler signed after coming to power was a non-aggression pact with Poland in 1934 - Mr Putin is conflating diplomatic outreach to a threatening neighbour with collaboration.

""The accusation that the Poles were collaborating is nonsense,"" says Mrs Prazmowska.

""You can't interpret these things as if this were collaboration with Nazi Germany, because it just so happened that the Soviet Union also signed treaties with Germany [at the same time].""","Tucker Carlson interview: Fact-checking Putin's 'nonsense' historyBy Ido Vock BBC NewsReutersMr Putin began the interview by claiming that 862 was the year of the ""establishment of the Russian state""US talk show host Tucker Carlson's interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin began with a rambling half-hour lecture on the history of Russia and Ukraine.

China's Spring Festival travel rush is the world's largest mass migration every year

""If I had the choice, I definitely wouldn't go back home,"" says Yuwen, a 33-year-old who has been unemployed for more than six months, days ahead of the Chinese New Year.

Many of China's nearly 380 million internal migrants only go home once a year - and the Lunar New Year, the most important festival for family reunion, is usually the time to do it. That is why the Spring Festival travel rush, known as ""chunyun"", is the world's largest annual mass migration. Authorities are expecting a record nine billion trips this time for the Year of the Dragon.

But Yuwen dreads the homecoming trip because he says he will be grilled by relatives over every aspect of his life, particularly his work situation including salaries and benefits. His parents know he has lost his job and have been understanding about it. They have agreed with Yuwen that the best course of action is to lie to relatives that he still has his old job.

Yuwen will also spend just three days with his relatives - usually it would be more than a week. ""It will be over soon,"" he says.

Hundreds of young people have taken to popular social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Weibo to say that they will not go home for the festival. Like Yuwen, some of them are recently unemployed.

Official data released in June 2023 revealed more than one in five city-dwellers aged between 16 and 24 in China were unemployed. China then suspended the release of youth unemployment data until last month. The figure now stands at 14.9% - but the data excludes students.

After decades of breakneck growth, the Chinese economy is losing steam and the anticipated post-Covid recovery has not materialised. Its real estate market has crashed, and local government debts are mounting.

But the confidence crisis is perhaps the thorniest issue - investors are worried that the Chinese leadership will prioritise party control over economic development. Under China's leader Xi Jinping, there have been crackdowns on private enterprises from tech to private tutoring. Relations with the West have also deteriorated over the last few years.

In 2014, he decided to pursue a graduate degree in Chinese language education in Beijing, about 185 miles (300km) away from his hometown in Hebei province. It was to ""ride the wave of a national policy"" - because Mr Xi had launched the Belt and Road Initiative a year before to spread greater influence overseas.

After he graduated, he quickly found a job at a private tutoring company and was tasked with managing and training foreign tutors for Chinese students. But in July 2021, the Chinese government banned private, for-profit tutoring in the name of easing the burden on students. This was a death knell for the $120bn (£95bn) tutoring industry.

Yuwen was forced to change careers. He got a job at a big tech company in January 2023. He was responsible for formulating live-streaming rules for its overseas platforms and supervising the work of prominent influencers. But it only lasted five months.

A regulatory crackdown on big tech since late 2020 had already wiped off more than $1 trillion in its value, according to Reuters. Then the US threatened sanctions against Chinese tech companies over concerns with Beijing's national security legislation. That proved to be the last straw for Yuwen's company, which decided to move its overseas operations outside China.

Yuwen says he has sent out his CV over 1,000 times in the last six months alone. He has not received any job offers even though he has already lowered his salary expectations. ""At the beginning, I felt quite calm but then I became increasingly anxious. I didn't expect it to be this difficult,"" he says.

Qingfeng moved to Shenzhen to be closer to his girlfriend, who is studying in Hong Kong

In the southern city of Shenzhen, fitness trainer Qingfeng has decided to go travelling by himself for the Chinese New Year.

He will lie to his parents, telling them he cannot buy the tickets to come home. ""Who doesn't want to go home to celebrate the new year? But I just feel embarrassed.""

After leaving the military in 2019, Qingfeng started working as a fitness instructor and says he was able to make about 20,000 yuan ($2,800; £2,200) per month in Shanghai. Last year, he moved to Shenzhen to be closer to his girlfriend who is studying in neighbouring Hong Kong.

The 28-year-old found a job with a foreign trading company as he wanted more job stability. But the pay was only 4,500 yuan a month. This was unsustainable as monthly rent in Shenzhen is at least 1,500 yuan.

Qingfeng left his job after two months and has now got a position at a new gym that will open after the holidays. But he does not want to see his family, because he says he lost almost all his savings last year. He does not want to divulge details, but he says: ""You can say that I have failed in the stock market.""

In early February, Chinese stocks plunged into a five-year low. The Weibo account of the US embassy became an outlet for the frustrations of Chinese investors, with some even calling on the Americans to help. Some criticised the current leadership. All such posts have since been taken down.

Not everyone is looking forward to the Year of the Dragon

Qingfeng is not sure he will be able to build a customer base at the new gym due to the economic downturn. ""Many large gyms have shut down lately because of their high debts.""

But is is not just the economy that has prevented some young Chinese from wanting to go home for the festival.

Some single women - like Xiaoba - say they do not want to be pressurised by their families to get married and settle down.

""I have been working across the country. Whenever I go to a city, my mother will find a man out of the blue and tell me to go on a blind date. It's outrageous,"" says the 35-year-old project manager.

Its low birth rate has caused fears that the country will lose young workers, who are a key force in propelling its economy. Young people are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children, and the number of registered marriages has been declining for nine consecutive years, according to official data.

In October, Mr Xi said women played a ""unique role"" in promoting traditional virtues and there was a need to cultivate a ""new marriage and childbearing culture"" to tackle the ageing population. But the government's efforts to boost marriage and birth rate so far have been ineffective.

Xiaoba no longer panics about getting married and is enjoying her life. She is planning to spend the Lunar New Year with her cat and watch the huge CCTV New Year's Gala - which is aired every Spring Festival Eve - at her rented flat in Shenzhen.

Yuwen, for his part, hopes that the next Lunar New Year will be better. ""I believe I will make it because I am determined. I have never considered giving up.""

But there are things out of his control. ""I am not too optimistic about the economy in 2024.""","After decades of breakneck growth, the Chinese economy is losing steam and the anticipated post-Covid recovery has not materialised.
Under China's leader Xi Jinping, there have been crackdowns on private enterprises from tech to private tutoring.
But in July 2021, the Chinese government banned private, for-profit tutoring in the name of easing the burden on students.
Then the US threatened sanctions against Chinese tech companies over concerns with Beijing's national security legislation.
But is is not just the economy that has prevented some young Chinese from wanting to go home for the festival."

Cillian Murphy is nominated for best actor at next month's Academy Awards

Cillian Murphy says he has struggled being in the spotlight, but he will try to enjoy the Academy Awards next month where he is nominated for best actor.

The Irish-born star has been nominated for Christopher Nolan's blockbuster Oppenheimer and is set to face off Maestro's Bradley Cooper for the prize.

""You'd be an eejit not to enjoy it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.

He was asked by host Lauren Laverne how he will deal with being out of his comfort zone at the Oscars.

""I have struggled with it in the past and you know, it's not something I'm ever totally at ease with - but I think you have to, like, choose to enjoy it and I think you can do that in your brain, just make that alteration and it's easier then,"" the 47-year-old said.

Murphy - also known for horror film 28 Days Later, thriller Red Eye and playing Tommy Shelby in hit BBC crime series Peaky Blinders - is often not forthcoming about his private life.

He has previously spoken about finding red carpets ""challenging"".

But, Murphy said having his wife, Yvonne McGuinness, by his side has been ""crucial"" to feeling grounded as the ""sort of ancillary aspect of being an actor is quite challenging"".

Murphy also said: ""To have a really secure solid base (with fame) is important.

Oil now covers some of Tobago's pristine beaches

Trinidad and Tobago is considering declaring a national emergency over a huge oil spill from a ship that ran aground and overturned this week.

At least 15km (nine miles) of Tobago's south-western coast have been affected, including some of the Caribbean island's pristine beaches.

Some 1,000 volunteers have now joined government staff to clean up the spill.

Divers have been trying to isolate the leak from the vessel, which was abandoned by its crew.

Farley Augustine, the chief secretary of the island of Tobago, on Saturday said the government may designate the accident a Level 3 disaster, the highest.

""Everything indicates that we are going in that direction,"" he was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.

The spill is currently Level 2, meaning the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management believes that the country can deal with the spill.

A national emergency is declared when local resources become ""overwhelmed"" and international assistance is needed.

The ship - identified only as The Gulfstream - capsized last Wednesday off the coast of the Cove Eco-Industrial Estate.

By Nadine Yousif BBC News

Alicia Joo/Jews for Ceasefire

The hunger strike follows months of protests against the Israel-Gaza war on Brown University's campus

A group of Brown University students have entered the eighth day of a hunger strike to pressure their school to divest from businesses they say benefit from Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.

The 19 students began their protests on 2 February.

They said they will continue until Brown officials consider divesting.

It is likely the longest hunger strike in the US since the beginning of the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.

The strike at the Ivy League university in Rhode Island has been organised by campus groups Palestine Solidarity Caucus and Jews for Ceasefire Now.

It is led by both Palestinian and Jewish students, said Ariela Rosenzweig, one of the students striking.

More than 27,900 Palestinians have been killed and at least 67,000 injured after Israel launched its campaign in the Palestinian enclave, according to the health ministry - which is run by Hamas.

The campaign followed an unprecedented assault by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which more than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed, according to Israeli officials.

Ms Rosenzweig, 22, said it was inspired by a similar 11-day hunger strike on campus in 1986 which called for divestment from firms operating under apartheid in South Africa.

""I see our hunger strike as part of a lineage of student organising,"" she told the BBC on Friday, adding that it follows months of protest at the university, including a sit-in in November where 61 students were arrested.

""It is a desperate plea for the university to not only hear our voices, but the voices of thousands who have been murdered in Gaza,"" Ms Rosenzweig said.

As part of the hunger strike, the students said they have only consumed water and pedialyte - an electrolyte solution - for over a week.

They added they have spent each day at the university's campus centre, taking part in protests and other programming to raise awareness about Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza, and have received support from other students and faculty.

Their action seeks to pressure Brown to consider a proposal recommending that it divest from companies that ""profit from human rights abuses in Palestine"".

The 16-page proposal, penned in 2020 by Brown's advisory committee on corporate responsibility in investment policies (ACCRIP), names 11 companies, including RTX Corporation, a weapons manufacturer and Northrop Grumman, a military company, among others.

The strike was timed ahead of a series of closed meetings by the Corporation of Brown taking place Thursday and Friday, where the students hoped their demands would be discussed.

In a letter sent to the students at the beginning of the hunger strike, Brown President Christina Paxson expressed concern for their wellbeing, but added that ""the bar for divestment is high"".

""It requires a demonstration that the University's investments in the assets of specific companies create social harm, and that divestment will alleviate that harm,"" she said in the letter, dated 4 February.

The president added that the university rejects using the endowment ""as a tool for political advocacy on contested issues"".

In an email, Brown spokesperson Brian Clark told BBC that the university is not directly invested in any defence stocks or large munition manufacturers.

And while a large percentage of the university's endowment is overseen by third-party managers, he said Brown is ""confident that our external managers have the highest level of ethics and share the values of the Brown community, including the rejection of violence"".

Sherena Razek, a PhD student and one of the organisers of the divestment campaign, said she believes the university's response shows ""a lack of regard"" for the students undertaking the hunger strike and their request.

She noted that the university has used divestment in the past to protest other issues, like the South African Apartheid, the Darfur genocide in Sudan and the tobacco industry.

Ms Rosenzweig said that given the university's divestment history, she and the other students believe their request is not impractical.

The hunger strike began as Hisham Awartani, a Palestinian-American student, returned to Brown's campus after spending months recovering from a gunshot wound to his spine.

Mr Awartani, who is among the students supporting the calls for divestment, was one of three young Palestinian-Americans who were shot in Burlington, Vermont on Thanksgiving weekend, in what they believe was a hate crime.

The suspected gunman, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder.

During the hunger strike, some students carried signs that read ""no others like Hisham"".

The protests at Brown are among many that have taken place across American university campuses, which have become the backdrop to heated debates on the ongoing Israel-Gaza war since October.

While it is likely the longest hunger strike in the US since October, it is not the first. Advocates, including Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon, staged a five-day hunger strike in November outside the White House calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.","Brown University students enter eighth day of hunger strike over Israel-GazaBy Nadine Yousif BBC NewsAlicia Joo/Jews for CeasefireThe hunger strike follows months of protests against the Israel-Gaza war on Brown University's campusA group of Brown University students have entered the eighth day of a hunger strike to pressure their school to divest from businesses they say benefit from Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.

By Nick Thorpe BBC News, Budapest

Reuters

Hungarian President Katalin Novak announced her resignation in a live television address

The president of Hungary has resigned live on television over a decision to pardon a man convicted of covering up a child sexual abuse case.

It was revealed last week President Novak had given clemency to a man jailed for forcing children to retract sexual abuse claims against a director of a state-run children's home.

Protests calling for her to step down had been growing in Hungary.

Ms Novak apologised and said she made ""a mistake"" in granting the pardon.

Judit Varga, the former minister of justice who approved the pardon, has also resigned from her new role leading the European elections campaign for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party.

The controversy which led to the resignations came after the names of 25 people pardoned by Ms Novak in April last year, as part of a visit to Hungary by Pope Francis, were made public by Hungarian media last week.

On the list of convicts was the deputy director of a children's home near Budapest, who had been jailed for three years after forcing children to retract claims of abuse against the director of the home.

The director had himself been jailed for eight years over abusing children at the government-run facility.

Hungarian opposition parties and protesters had been demanding her resignation, but Ms Novak's decision to do so was as sudden as it was unexpected.

Ms Novak is a popular figure in Fidesz and a rare female politician in a male-dominated country. She is a key ally of Hungarian Mr Orban and previously worked as his family minister.

In 2022, she became the first woman to hold the largely ceremonial role of Hungarian president.

The case has unleashed an unprecedented political scandal for Hungary's long-serving nationalist government.

In particular, it caused deep embarrassment for Fidesz, which has made traditional family values the cornerstone of its social policy.

Speaking in an address live on television, Ms Novak said she granted the pardon in the belief the convicted man ""did not exploit the vulnerability of the children under his oversight"".

She apologised to victims who ""might have felt that I did not stand up for them"".

""I made a mistake, as the pardon and the lack of reasoning were conducive to triggering doubts about the zero tolerance that applies to paedophilia,"" Ms Novak added.

In addition to the resignation of Ms Novak, another leading female politician from Fidesz has also resigned over the same case.

Judit Varga, who was minister of justice at the time of the pardon, countersigned the clemency decision.","Hungarian President Katalin Novak resigns over child abuse pardon scandalBy Nick Thorpe BBC News, BudapestReutersHungarian President Katalin Novak announced her resignation in a live television addressThe president of Hungary has resigned live on television over a decision to pardon a man convicted of covering up a child sexual abuse case.

On 1 February, Myanmar entered its fourth year since the coup

The government in Myanmar has announced compulsory military service for all young men and women as the country's turmoil continues.

The army seized power from the civilian government in a coup in February 2021.

But in recent months it has been defeated in a series of battles with ethnic militias and anti-coup fighters.

The move announced on Saturday will require all men aged 18-35, and women aged 18-27, to serve at least two years under military command.

No further details have been released. But in a statement, the junta said its defence ministry would ""release necessary bylaws, procedures, announcements orders, notifications and instructions"".

The military has faced a series of humiliating defeats in recent months.

At the end of last year, three ethnic insurgent armies in Shan State - supported by other armed groups that oppose the government - captured border crossings and roads carrying most of the overland trade with China.

Last month, the Arakan Army (AA) said it had taken control of Paletwa in Chin State and the last military post in Paletwa township, the hilltop base at Meewa.

The military-installed president of Myanmar, Myint Swe - a former general - has previously warned the country is in danger of breaking apart if the government could not bring fighting under control.

A law allowing conscription was introduced in Myanamar in 2010, but has not been not enforced until now.

Under the legislation, the terms of service can be extended up to a period of five years during a state of emergency. Those ignoring summons to serve can instead be jailed for the same period.

A state of emergency was announced by the country's junta in 2021 and was recently extended for a further six months.

Myanmar had endured almost 50 years of rule under oppressive military regimes before the move towards democracy in 2011.

On 1 February 2021, the military announced it had taken control of the country.

Disorders and fighting have affected the country ever since, with more than one million people being displaced and thousands killed.","Myanmar's military government enforces conscription lawBy Maria Zaccaro BBC NewsGetty ImagesOn 1 February, Myanmar entered its fourth year since the coupThe government in Myanmar has announced compulsory military service for all young men and women as the country's turmoil continues.

Taylor Swift has arrived at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, with footage from the stadium showing her with famous friends Blake Lively and Ice Spice.

The singer, who is dating the Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce made it in the nick of time after playing a concert in Japan on Saturday evening.

Her journey, from Tokyo to Los Angeles, was tracked by thousands online.

Swift has recently threatened to sue a student who tracks her private jet and shares its movements online.

Ahead of Sunday's big game, many had wondered which friends and family she would bring along with her to watch.

A video from the stadium shows her parents, Andrea and Scott Swift, with her, In another clip, Swift was seen greeting Travis Kelce's brother, Jason Kelce, who is also a NFL player.

Earlier this month, the Japanese embassy in the US joined the conversation surrounding Swift's Super Bowl dash, posting a statement about it on social media.

""If she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins,"" the embassy said.

The 17-hour time difference between Tokyo and Los Angeles is thought to have helped Swift get back to the US in time to visit her home in LA before heading to Sin City.

In 2022, Swift topped the list of celebrities with the highest private jet CO2 emissions, according to digital marketing firm Yard.

Swift has been a regular at games since she began dating tight end Travis Kelce - and is credited with bringing along thousands of new fans to the sport.

Watch: ""I did not handle this right,"" Lloyd Austin apologises

US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is back in the hospital for an ""emergent bladder issue"", the Pentagon said.

The White House has been informed, the Pentagon said on Sunday, and Mr Austin will continue to carry out his duties.

It comes less than a month after his secretive hospital stay in December sparked controversy for which he apologised last week.

Late last year, Mr Austin had surgery for prostate cancer.

He was readmitted to hospital on New Year's Day with severe pain in his leg, hip and abdomen because of complications related to the procedure. An evaluation found a urinary tract infection and he remained in hospital for more than two weeks.

Senior defence officials and the Biden administration did not know that Mr Austin was seriously ill until three days after his re-admission in January.

The incident incited concerns over both transparency and security and prompted three separate investigations into Mr Austin's handling of his illness and hospital stays.

He has been called to testify in front of a Congressional committee about his failure to inform President Biden and other top officials this week, on 14 February.

For this most recent hospital admission, the Deputy Secretary of Defence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have also been notified. The deputy secretary is prepared to assume Mr Austin's duties, if required, the Pentagon said.","Lloyd Austin: Defence secretary returns to hospitalBy Holly Honderich in WashingtonWatch: ""I did not handle this right,"" Lloyd Austin apologisesUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is back in the hospital for an ""emergent bladder issue"", the Pentagon said.

Watch: Trump would not protect countries from attack by Russia if they do not pay enough into Nato

Donald Trump's suggestion the US would not protect Nato allies failing to spend enough on defence ""undermines all of our security"", the Western military alliance's chief has said.

Jens Stoltenberg also suggested it put US and European troops at greater risk.

The Republican said he had told allies he would ""encourage"" Russia to attack any Nato member that failed to meet the alliance's target of 2% of their GDP.

Members of Nato commit to defend any nation in the bloc that gets attacked.

President Joe Biden called Mr Trump's comments ""appalling and dangerous"", suggesting his predecessor intended to give Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a green light for more war and violence"".

Addressing crowds during a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, Mr Trump said he had made his comments about Russia during a previous meeting of leaders of Nato countries.

The former president recalled that the leader of a ""big country"" had presented a hypothetical situation in which he was not meeting his financial obligations within Nato and had come under attack from Moscow.

He said the leader had asked if the US would come to his country's aid in that scenario, which prompted him to issue a rebuke.

""I said: 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?'... 'No I would not protect you, in fact I would encourage them to do whatever they want. You gotta pay.'""

The frontrunner for the Republican nomination for this year's presidential election did not make clear which nation or leader he was speaking about, or even when this conversation took place.

According to Nato's own figures for 2023 spending, 19 of its 30 member nations are spending below the target of 2% of their annual GDP on defence - among them Germany, Norway and France.

But most countries which border Ukraine, Russia, or its neighbour and ally Belarus, are exceeding this guideline.

At over 3.9% of its annual GDP, Poland spends even more than the US. Romania, Hungary, Finland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia range between 2.3 and 2.7% for defence expenditure.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr Stoltenberg emphasised the alliance remains ""ready and able"" to defend its members and any attack ""will be met with a united and forceful response"".

But he said any suggestion that ""allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security"", and suggested Mr Trump's remarks ""put American and European soldiers at increased risk"".

""I expect that regardless of who wins the presidential election the US will remain a strong and committed Nato ally,"" he added.

Following Mr Stoltenberg's comments, US President Joe Biden said: ""Donald Trump's admission that he intends to give Putin a green light for more war and violence, to continue his brutal assault against a free Ukraine, and to expand his aggression to the people of Poland and the Baltic states, [is] appalling and dangerous.""

Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's only remaining rival for the Republican nomination, warned against taking the side of Russia and Mr Putin - who she described as a ""thug who kills his opponents"" in an interview with the BBC's US partner CBS News.

Nikki Haley says the last thing the US ""would ever want to do is side with Russia""

Mr Trump has long been critical of Nato and what he sees as an excessive financial burden on the United States to guarantee the defence of 30 other nations.

Dr Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert and former Nato analyst, told the BBC that Mr Trump was reflecting anger in the US that some European Nato countries were not spending 2% of their budget on the military, as Nato wants.

""Playing hardball with Nato allies is correct, but it all depends on how far you go. These comments are too far, really,"" he said.

But he said such statements had an impact at a time when Russia had put its economy onto a war footing and its military spending was outstripping that of European countries.

""If Trump is in the White House and there was a split in Nato either over Ukraine... or about how it would respond to a small incursion that should in theory trigger article five. That's where the Nato alliance is worried are these what-ifs,"" he said.

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after Mr Trump left office. He has since bemoaned the amount of US money sent to Ukraine, which is not a Nato member.

The US has provided Ukraine with more financial support than any other country - totalling more than $44bn (£34bn) since the 2022 invasion, according to White House figures from December.

However, Republicans in Congress have since the turn of the year blocked all new funding - demanding tough measures to restrict migration into the US on its southern border, and then refusing the amended bill when it was presented earlier this week.

Jack Sweeney

Jack Sweeney insists that he means no harm against those whose planes he tracks

A university student from Florida has made a habit of getting under the skin of some of the world's richest and most powerful people. How? By telling the rest of us where their private planes are - and how much carbon they emit.

Jack Sweeney would like to clarify a few details. For one thing, he thinks Taylor Swift has some good tunes.

However, he believes - despite the threat of legal action - that anybody should be able to see where her private jet is headed, and how often it flies.

""I like to be fair,"" he told the BBC in an email. ""I try to share everyone's info no matter who it is.""

But it is specifically information about the locations of private planes of the rich and powerful - posted to his social media accounts - that has repeatedly made the 21-year-old the subject of news stories and legal threats.

Mr Sweeney is the son of an airline maintenance operations controller and a teacher, and grew up in the suburbs of Orlando. He says he has always had an interest in aviation and technology, and particularly in Elon Musk's SpaceX and Tesla companies.

Those interests gradually led him to develop a plane tracking website, TheAirTraffic.com, and social media accounts which track the aircraft of celebrities, politicians, tycoons and Russian oligarchs.

The system relies on publicly available data collected by amateur enthusiasts. Aeroplanes in the sky regularly send out information about where they are located, and these signals can be picked up by people using inexpensive receivers on the ground.

This thriving cohort of online plane trackers is part of the larger Osint (open-source intelligence) community, populated by people who delve into masses of freely available online data looking for incriminating, insightful or just plain interesting nuggets of information. It is a motley crew that includes a range of individuals - from the mildly curious to dedicated researchers and committed investigative journalists.

""Originally I was just kind of doing this as a hobby as I found it interesting,"" said Mr Sweeney, who is currently in his third year of an information technology degree at the University of Central Florida.

As time has gone by, he has found a more defined purpose. He says he believes ""in the importance of transparency and public information"".

And there is an environmental angle: ""The flyers are trying to hide the bad PR of [carbon] emissions.""

His data has been used in studies showing the huge carbon footprint of Ms Swift and her entourage. The singer says she has bought enough carbon offsets to cancel out emissions from her latest tour twice over.

But there are also privacy issues at stake. Ms Swift, through her lawyers, contends that revealing the location of her private plane puts her at risk from stalkers.

In a letter first revealed by the Washington Post, lawyers for the singer wrote that plane tracking was a ""life-or-death matter"" and there was ""no legitimate interest in or public need for this information, other than to stalk, harass, and exert dominion and control"".

Mr Sweeney rejects those assertions and says there is a fundamental public interest in locating the pop star's plane. His proof? Swifties themselves.

""Her fans, who have grown the TaylorSwiftJets accounts and subreddit, are the ones truly interested,"" he says. ""These tracking accounts consistently have more supporters and fans [than detractors].""

Taylor Swift performing Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome

And given world tours and numerous public appearances - including recently at marquee NFL games - it is usually fairly easy to figure out where Ms Swift will be at some point in the future.

Over the past fortnight, for instance, numerous stories have been published outlining how she might be able to travel between two pressing engagements - her Saturday night show in Tokyo and Sunday's Super Bowl in Las Vegas.

Much of this public information is more granular than the location of a plane. Flight data can show who owns an aircraft and where it is in the sky, but not who is on it, or where those people travel to after the plane lands.

But Ms Swift's representatives say the plane information gives exact times and locations of her movements, and notes that one alleged stalker was recently arrested outside her New York home. Her publicist Tree Paine said in a statement: ""His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be.""

Mr Sweeney also had some advice for the star - gently suggesting that if privacy is her top concern, she could register her private jet through an anonymous corporate entity and perhaps choose an identification code that does not include her birthday and initials.

James Slater, Mr Sweeney's lawyer, says that he does not expect Ms Swift to take any further legal action.

""The letter was an attempt to bully Jack into doing something that legally he doesn't have to do,"" he said. ""Unfortunately folks with power and money often do this.

""He's not doing anything unlawful.""

Ms Swift's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

One question is whether the Swift fandom will still follow Mr Sweeney's accounts after the latest news.

After the story broke about the legal letter, there was a flurry of online chatter about the case. It included support for Mr Sweeney but also sentiments such as: ""Jack Sweeney wants Taylor Swift to die like Princess Diana. I'm not letting this go. I'm so angry.""

But it is not the first time Mr Sweeney has been on the receiving end of pressure from the rich and famous.

Most notably, when he purchased Twitter (now X) in 2022, Elon Musk vowed in the name of free speech not to take action against Mr Sweeney's @elonjet tracking account.

In a matter of weeks, however, Mr Musk reversed course, banned the account and threatened to sue, claiming that @elonjet resulted in a stalker tracking him down and climbing on top of his craft when his small child was inside.

Police later identified a member of Mr Musk's security team as a suspect, and said that Mr Sweeney's account had nothing to do with the incident.

Mr Sweeney now runs an account that tracks Mr Musk's jet with a 24-hour delay, in order to comply with a site rule banning real-time location tracking.

He also runs accounts on several social media sites keeping track of planes owned by Kim Kardashian, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Donald Trump and others.

But he expressed frustration at the vagaries of social media rules, noting that Meta has suspended the Facebook and Instagram accounts tracking Ms Swift's plane, but has left up various other plane tracking accounts - including the ones which track Mr Zuckerberg's aircraft.

The BBC has contacted Meta for comment.

Meanwhile the planespotters who chat on Mr Sweeney's server on the Discord site have defended his stance - along with their enthusiasm for their hobby. And some admitted they, too, are fans of Ms Swift.

""I have no doubt crazy people have sent her wild threats,"" said one commenter, ""but the airport is not the place where she is vulnerable.""","Mr Sweeney is the son of an airline maintenance operations controller and a teacher, and grew up in the suburbs of Orlando.

And so it begins. Nine months still to go before the next US presidential election and already the Republican party favourite and former President Donald Trump is sending eyebrows and blood pressure skywards in Nato capitals with his provocative statements.

And yet they will delight many of his supporters.

Suggesting at a rally in South Carolina that he would ""encourage"" aggressors (for example Russia) ""to do whatever the hell they want"" with Nato countries that fail to pay their dues has prompted an immediate condemnation from the White House. A spokesman called the comment ""appalling and unhinged"", saying it was ""encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes"".

Nato Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has also responded forcefully, saying: ""Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the US, and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.""

Did Trump mean what he said? Probably not. This is typical Trump fare. Say something provocative, grab some headlines, outrage your critics and thrill your fans.

Yet ironically, there is a grudging gratitude in some quarters of Nato for Mr Trump's threats when he was in the White House. Back in 2018, President Trump was so angered by the failure of several European nations to fulfil their agreed quota of spending 2% of GDP on defence that he threatened to pull the US out of the alliance altogether.

Military chiefs throughout Nato were aghast. If a US president ever went through with such a threat, abandoning Europe to fend for itself, it would so severely undermine the alliance that it would cease to exist in its present form.

But the shockwaves it sent, coupled with Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, have had the effect of prompting some, notably Germany, to promise to raise their defence spending accordingly.

Watch: Trump would not protect countries from attack by Russia if they do not pay enough into Nato

For Trump supporters, and others too, his gripe about other nations not paying their way resonates strongly. According to statistics published by Nato themselves, US military spending in 2023 amounted to 3.49% of GDP. The UK spent 2.07%, but Germany, France, Italy and Spain all came in below the agreed 2% threshold.

Tellingly, the countries closest to Russia's borders spent the most in percentage terms. There are voices in the US Republican party saying, ""Why should we, America, carry the burden of defending Europe when it won't pay for its own defence?"".

Mr Trump's throwaway comments still constitute dangerous talk at a dangerous time, for Nato and for the Western world. Ukraine's summer 2023 offensive has failed.

Russian forces remain firmly in place in the areas they have occupied and are slowly pushing back the Ukrainians in the Donbas. Moscow has moved its economy on to a war footing, allocating about 40% of national income to defence, churning out low-quality weaponry in vast numbers in the hopes of overwhelming Ukraine's defences.

Poland and the Baltic states are convinced that once President Putin has achieved his war aims in Ukraine, then Russia will rebuild its army and make a move on their countries, perhaps as soon as within three years from now.

Much faith has been placed in the long-standing deterrent value of something called Article 5. This is the part of Nato's constitution that stipulates that an attack on any member state calls for the collective defence by all.

In other words, should Moscow decide to send tanks across its borders into, say, Estonia, then this would trigger a massive response by Nato. Under a Trump presidency, that certainty would not look nearly so certain.

And thereby lies the danger in Trump's comments. If a future aggressor, be it Vladimir Putin in Europe or Xi Jinping in the South China Sea, begins to doubt Washington's commitment to defend its allies, then it risks a massive miscalculation. You don't have to look far for an example. Two years ago, President Putin's intelligence people told him the West would sit on its hands if he invaded Ukraine.","Trump on Nato: Dangerous talk at a dangerous timeBy Frank Gardner BBC security correspondentEPABritish Army soldiers on a military exercise in Estonia on 10 FebruaryAnd so it begins.

HMS Prince of Wales has remained in Portsmouth despite a scheduled departure

A Royal Navy aircraft carrier has failed to set sail for a Nato exercise, a week after its sister ship pulled out because of a mechanical fault.

HMS Prince of Wales was due to replace HMS Queen Elizabeth in Exercise Steadfast Defender - the largest Nato exercise since the Cold War.

However, the £3bn warship has remained in Portsmouth and the harbour mouth has been reopened to normal marine traffic.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the departure had been ""postponed"".

Hundreds of people lined Portsmouth Harbour to watch the carrier's scheduled departure at 12:15 GMT.

However, after MoD police boats secured the area and the harbour mouth was closed, the channel was reopened and the crowd dispersed.

Last Sunday, HMS Queen Elizabeth cancelled its deployment to the exercise off Norway at the last minute, after an ""issue"" was found with a coupling on the starboard propeller shaft.

In 2022, HMS Prince of Wales broke down off the Isle of Wight, when it also suffered a malfunction with a coupling on its starboard propeller.

The MoD previously said the issues were ""separate and not linked"".

HMS Prince of Wales was taken to Rosyth, Fife, to undergo repairs, which took nine months to complete.

An MoD spokesman said the sailing had been postponed and added that a further announcement would be made later on Sunday.","HMS Prince of Wales fails to depart for Nato exercisesPA MediaHMS Prince of Wales has remained in Portsmouth despite a scheduled departureA Royal Navy aircraft carrier has failed to set sail for a Nato exercise, a week after its sister ship pulled out because of a mechanical fault.

Kelvin Kiptum broke Eliud Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last October

The men's marathon world record holder, Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum, 24, has died in a road accident in his home country, a Kenyan athletics official has confirmed to the BBC.

He was killed alongside his coach, Rwanda's Gervais Hakizimana in a car on a road near the town of Eldoret.

Kiptum emerged in 2023 as a rival to his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge.

He broke Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last October, running the 26.1 miles in two hours and 35 seconds.

Just last week, his team announced that he would attempt to run the distance in under two hours at the Rotterdam marathon - a feat that has never been achieved in open competition.

Kenya's opposition leader and former prime minister, Raila Odinga, said on X that the country had lost ""a true hero"" and was mourning ""a remarkable individual... and Kenyan athletics icon"".

Paying tribute to the young man, Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, described Kiptum as ""an incredible athlete leaving an incredible legacy, we will miss him dearly"".

The rise to fame for the father-of-two had been rapid - he only ran his first full marathon in 2022.

He competed in his first major competition four years earlier running in borrowed shoes as he could not afford a pair of his own.

He was among a new crop of Kenyan athletes who began their careers on the road, breaking away from the past tradition of athletes starting on the track before switching to longer distances.

Kiptum told the BBC last year that his unusual choice was simply determined by a lack of resources.","Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum: Marathon world record holder dies in road accidentBy Celestine Karoney BBC Sport Africa, NairobiGetty ImagesKelvin Kiptum broke Eliud Kipchoge's world record in Chicago last OctoberThe men's marathon world record holder, Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum, 24, has died in a road accident in his home country, a Kenyan athletics official has confirmed to the BBC.

By Lipika Pelham & Carrie Davies, Pakistan correspondent BBC News

BBC

Some demonstrators supporting Imran Khan gathered in the city of Rawalpindi

Pakistan's second and third political blocs have agreed to co-operate after elections in which jailed ex-PM Imran Khan's supporters came first.

Ex-PM Nawaz Sharif's PMLN and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's PPP issued a statement saying they planned to work together to bring political stability.

If they do form a government, the move is likely to anger Mr Khan's followers.

His PTI party was barred from taking part in the election, so most of its candidates stood as independents.

Earlier, police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of Mr Khan's supporters in Rawalpindi.

According to final results, independents won 101 of the National Assembly seats. BBC analysis shows 93 of them went to PTI-backed candidates.

That puts them ahead of the PMLN, who won 75, and the PPP, who gained 54.

The two parties formed an alliance to oust Mr Khan from power in 2022 and ruled until last August.

The Karachi-based MQM party has also made a surprising return in the polls, winning 17 seats, and could play a role in any coalition.

As wrangling continues, independent candidates who did not win have flooded courts with vote-rigging allegations.

Both the PTI, which was blocked from taking part in the election, and Mr Sharif's PMLN say they want to form the next government.

The result was a surprise as most observers had expected Mr Sharif's party - widely seen as having the powerful military's backing - to win, given Mr Khan had been jailed on charges ranging from corruption to having married illegally and his party was barred from the ballot sheet.

To govern, a candidate has to show they are at the head of a coalition with a simple majority of 169 seats in the National Assembly.

Of the National Assembly's 366 seats, 266 are decided by direct voting and 70 are reserved - 60 for women and 10 for non-Muslims - and these are allocated according to the strength of each party in the assembly.

Under Pakistan's rules, independent candidates are not eligible to be allocated reserved seats in parliament.

The PTI, among several other parties, has called for protests against the results, alleging they have been rigged.

On Sunday, police blocked streets near the electoral commission building in Rawalpindi with barbed wire and large trucks, preventing any protesters from accessing it.

For about 90 minutes, a crowd of a few hundred protestors chanted on the street. Then the atmosphere turned. Police used several rounds of teargas to disperse the crowd, which then left the area.

The Punjab police told the BBC that there was a section 144 in place - a colonial-era law that stopped a gathering of more than four people.

This restriction had been put in place before the election until 12 February, but it detailed that civilians were not allowed to carry firearms, not that they were prevented from gathering.

Police in Rawalpindi used teargas to disperse a crowd protesting against alleged rigging

The PTI's chairman had called for peaceful protests outside electoral commission offices where they were concerned about ""forged"" results.

Pakistani media reported that the PTI party claimed that the results of at least 18 National Assembly seats were ""falsely changed"" by election officers.

On Saturday, Mr Sharif - who is thought to be favoured by the military - called for other parties to help him form a unity government.

As negotiations got under way between Mr Khan's political rivals, experts have warned Pakistan could be facing a ""prolonged period of political instability"".

Dr Farzana Shaikh from the Chatham House think tank told the BBC that the Khan-linked independents were unlikely to be allowed to form a government and many people feared a ""weak and unstable coalition"" would result from any tie-up between Mr Sharif and the PPP.

Meanwhile, at least six PTI-backed candidates who did not win their seats have lodged legal challenges in the courts to try to get the outcome overturned.

Among them is Yasmin Rashid, who stood against Mr Sharif in Lahore. The petitioners allege collusion in the alteration of election results on specific forms.","Pakistan election: Pact may shut out Imran Khan supportersBy Lipika Pelham & Carrie Davies, Pakistan correspondent BBC NewsBBCSome demonstrators supporting Imran Khan gathered in the city of RawalpindiPakistan's second and third political blocs have agreed to co-operate after elections in which jailed ex-PM Imran Khan's supporters came first.

King Charles has attended church in Sandringham in his first public outing since Buckingham Palace announced his cancer diagnosis.

The King waved to members of the public as he walked outside St Mary Magdalene Church with his wife, Queen Camilla.

It comes after the King, 75, thanked people on Saturday for their ""support and good wishes"" since the news.

He said all those affected by cancer knew ""such kind thoughts"" were ""the greatest comfort and encouragement"".

Around 100 well-wishers were gathered on Sunday as the King walked into church in Sandringham, briefly speaking with the Rev Canon Dr Paul Williams.

Crowds gathered around the gates of the private estate, but were not allowed to enter the grounds - which are closed to the public until Easter.

King Charles left Clarence House, London, for his Norfolk residence on Tuesday, accompanied by the Queen. His youngest son, the Duke of Sussex, had flown in from the US for a brief visit earlier that day.

The King's cancer was detected while he was undergoing treatment in London for an enlarged prostate in January.

While the type of cancer has not been disclosed, the Palace confirmed it was not prostate cancer.

King Charles has stepped back from all public-facing duties while he receives treatment, with senior royals - including Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales - taking on his duties for some events.

In his message of thanks, the King wrote: ""It is equally heartening to hear how sharing my own diagnosis has helped promote public understanding and shine a light on the work of all those organisations which support cancer patients and their families across the UK and wider world.

""My lifelong admiration for their tireless care and dedication is all the greater as a result of my own personal experience.""

Sarawak Report founder Clare Rewcastle Brown is the sister-in-law of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown

UK journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown has accused Malaysia of seeking ""political revenge"" for her reporting after a court jailed her in absentia.

The 64-year-old is appealing a surprise conviction for criminal defamation of a Malaysian royal handed down this week.

A local magistrates' court sentenced her to two years in prison during a single-day hearing.

Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she was being targeted after her work on the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal.

The scandal saw $4.5bn (£3.9bn) stolen from the Malaysian sovereign fund founded by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in what is thought to be the world's largest kleptocracy case.

It ensnared top Hollywood celebrities, brought down bankers from Goldman Sachs and saw the first criminal charges filed against the storied Wall Street firm.

Najib was jailed in 2022 but still faces a raft of other charges. He denies all wrongdoing.

On Wednesday the Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court ruled that Ms Rewcastle Brown criminally defamed Malaysia's former Queen Nur Zahirah in her book The Sarawak Report - The Inside Story of the 1MDB Expose.

Ms Rewcastle Brown said she was not notified in advance nor given the opportunity to defend herself in court. Her lawyers have already requested the ruling be set aside by a higher court on violations of the criminal procedure code.

""I'm afraid this is malicious, it is politically motivated. And I see it as revenge for my public interest journalism,"" she told the BBC.""I think there are a lot of very powerful and wealthy people in Malaysia who are revengeful that I identified the corruption of their former prime minister [Najib Razak], who remains popular and powerful and wealthy.

""And I think that it's no coincidence that just two or three days after [he] failed to get a pardon from the [Malaysian] King that would have let him out of jail after a fraction of his sentence, that this sentence was then passed against me"".

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described the decision to jail Rewcastle Brown as ""outrageous"" and has called on Malaysia to scrap the sentence and to ""stop harassing the journalist over her crucial reporting on the country's 1MDB scandal, recognized as one of the world's biggest-ever corruption cases"".

""The harsh ruling will deter all reporters from investigating official corruption in Malaysia and represents a clear and present danger to press freedom in the country,"" CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative Shawn Crispin said in a statement issued on Friday.

Defamation cases

Malaysia has the world's only rotating constitutional monarchy. The federal head of state changes every five years in what is a largely ceremonial role but the monarch wields significant cultural and political influence.

The oil-rich coastal state of Terengganu is home to one of the country's nine royal families. The Malay ruler is called a Sultan and his wife, a Sultanah.

Terrangganu Sultanah Nur Zahirah, who served as Malaysia's Queen from 2006-2011, has filed two defamation cases against Ms Rewcastle Brown for allegedly insinuating she was involved in corrupt practices linked to 1MDB.

The first was a civil case in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur which was dismissed by the High Court in October 2022. That was overturned on appeal and is still making its way through the courts. The second filing was the case in her local magistrates court which she has won.

Ms Rewcastle Brown said there was a misidentification error in the book that was corrected back in 2018. She also apologised for the error. But her legal team have argued that the error is not defamation, nor criminal libel.

""I do fear that there has been manipulation of this case and I do not seek to lay blame for that at the feet of the Sultanah. She was understandably annoyed,"" Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC.

Sultanah Nur Zahirah and her legal team have been approached for comment by the BBC.

The former leader is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence that was halved this week by Malaysia's pardons board - a move that sends a message leaders in South East Asia can act with impunity, said James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania.

Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which previously led the ruling coalition that governed Malaysia, has been pushing for a royal pardon after testing and exhausting other legal avenues of appeal.

Najib had his sentence halved last month

Ms Rewcastle Brown told the BBC she finds it hard to believe Najib's reduced sentence and her defamation conviction, which took place shortly afterward, are not linked.

""I have become somewhat emblematic in the eyes of those who are deeply resentful that Najib was found guilty and convicted of this crime.

""We can speculate, but I think that it's hard to come to the conclusion other than it is all connected to this 1MDB case"".

Najib's lawyers are reportedly also trying to get Netflix documentary Man On The Run about the 1MDB scandal taken down for ""sub judicial and contemptuous"" content.

He is also said to be looking to take legal action against former Malaysian attorney-general Tommy Thomas and Rewcastle-Brown over their statements in the documentary Man On The Run.

A Netflix spokesperson said they wouldn't be commenting on the matter.

Interpol involvement

Ms Rewcastle Brown also fears the Terengganu magistrates court ruling may impact her ability to travel freely.

Malaysian law enforcement officials have twice before applied for an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown on charges related to her 1MDB reporting. Interpol denied the previous two applications, she said.

It is unclear whether Malaysian authorities will pursue an Interpol Red Notice for Rewcastle Brown's arrest again. The Kuala Terengganu Magistrates' Court did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment.

Ms Rewcastle Brown is requesting support from the UK government and various non-governmental organisations such as the CPJ and Index on Censorship.

Born in Sarawak, Ms Rewcastle Brown has two grown sons with husband Andrew Brown, a media strategist and former journalist who is the younger brother of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

She founded investigative website Sarawak Report in 2010, which made her name as a journalist and environmental campaigner focused on corruption in the lucrative palm oil trade.

She hopes to one day return to Malaysia without the threat of imprisonment.

""I will just keep going,"" she said. ""I'm just one of many, many journalists campaigning to support the right of journalists to do their job, which is to bring information in the public interest to the wider audience.""

By Zaria Gorvett Features correspondent @ZariaGorvett

The Western world was once obsessed with these macabre memorials.

*This article contains details and images that some readers might find distressing.

On 7 May 1821, two doctors were engrossed in a frantic search. There was a decomposing body at stake – and if they didn't find some plaster soon, its features would be lost forever.

Mere hours earlier, the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte had succumbed to a brief illness, after six years in exile. Those in attendance were keen to create a death mask, an impression of the face usually taken soon after the person has died. But there were two small glitches to the plan.

Firstly, the hunt was unfolding on the tropical island of Saint Helena, a barren speck in the South Atlantic, 807 miles (1,299km) from any other land. There were no shops on this ""miserable and dreary rock"", as Napoleon described it, that could supply highly specialist products such as plaster. Secondly, neither of the doctors present had ever made a death mask before.

The history of death masks stretches back millennia, deep into antiquity. Most of them were not exact replicas taken from moulds, but artworks created for elite members of society – protective armour that could help the deceased to navigate the afterlife or ward off evil spirits.

By the late Middle Ages, Europe had become obsessed with death, after the plague wiped out up to 50% of the population in just four traumatic years. It was at this moment that true death masks superseded the sculpted, artistic kind. These likenesses, created by moulding wax or plaster over the face, were a useful way of fossilising the features of deceased relatives, so that sculptors could use them as a reference for the lifelike portraits displayed at funerals. Then in the 18th Century, something unexpected happened: people began to value death masks for their own sake.

For the next 200 years, doctors across Europe set about assiduously preserving these glimpses of the moments after death for posterity. The faces of icons, criminals and even babies were immortalised in grisly detail – a practise that coincided with a surge of interest in the pseudoscience phrenology, in which a person's personality traits were inferred from the features of their skull. Many death masks were turned into spooky heirlooms, while some became souvenirs that command six-figure sums to this day. One was revered as an object of beauty comparable to the Mona Lisa, inspiring countless artworks and wild theories.

This is a short history of the death mask, and what it can reveal about how our attitudes to death have changed over the centuries.

A collector's item

Back on the island of Saint Helena, the two doctors still needed to make Napoleon's death mask – and still couldn't find any plaster. But they had a couple of backup ideas.

One of them – Napoleon's personal physician François Antommarchi – darted off to the local village, Jamestown, and purchased some 150 figurines made from plaster. These were then ground down to a powder and used to make an improvised plaster mash. Alas, when this messy mixture was applied to the dead man's face, it didn't work.

The other doctor – Irish surgeon Francis Burton – focused his efforts on tracking down the raw ingredient in plaster: gypsum, a soft mineral found in layers of sedimentary rock. To turn one into the other, gypsum is ground into a powder, and heated to evaporate off its water content. This breaks down the crystals within the rock. The next step is mixing this dehydrated gypsum with water again to form a paste. As it dries, its crystal structure reforms and the plaster is left set in its moulded state.

Eventually a local source of this prized ingredient was identified, and one and a half days after Napoleon took his final, shallow breaths, the cast was accomplished. By this point, Napoleon had been deceased for longer than was usual when making death masks, so his face is immortalised in its deathly state – with sunken eyes and hollowed cheeks. Decomposition had begun to kick in already, and the facial muscles were less tense, giving the usually-melancholy man a relaxed look.

However, if the former French emperor had dreamed that his likeness would have ended up at the bedside of his wife, Marie Louise, or in a place of national honour, he might have been surprised at what happened next. Antommarchi eventually stole the blueprint for his colleague's successful death mask, and created hundreds of copies which could be purchased as collectible souvenirs, for as little as 20 francs. Though the original death mask has long since vanished, its progeny are scattered at museums and in private collections across the globe to this day.

The Age of Enlightenment

When Isaac Newton died in his sleep at the age of 84, in 1727, he left behind an intimidating legacy. Among other things, this included a corpus of letters and manuscripts comprising some 10 million words of writing, numerous world-changing discoveries, including the laws of gravity, endless notes on failed alchemical experiments – and a bizarre assortment of anagrams of his own name. Soon afterwards, a death mask was added to this list.

Ancient Rome

In the Roman era, elite citizens often honoured the death of a family member by creating idealised funerary masks. These ""imagines"" weren't usually buried with the deceased, but kept as memorials and stored in special niches in the family home – and even sometimes worn to other funerals by living family members. This tradition was traditionally reserved for older men and allowed for them to be initiated into a family's canon of ancestors.

But around the 2nd Century AD, there was a twist: imagines became popular among the lower classes, too. These versions were true death masks, made as casts, and in this non-elite world, they weren't just reserved for men. According to research by Kelsey Madden, a research student in archaeology at the University of Sheffield, UK, this hints that, for the lower classes, women and children were also allowed to become ""ancestors"".

One famous imagine thought to be in this category is that of Claudia Victoria, a 10-year-old girl who lived in the Roman city of Lugdunum in Gaul, which is now buried under Lyon, France. Her round, youthful face was captured in plaster, and buried alongside her in her tomb. The inscription read: ""To the departed spirit of Claudia Victoria who lived ten years, one month and eleven days. Her mother Claudia Severina made this monument for her sweet daughter and for herself in her lifetime.""

The Industrial Revolution

In the late 1880s, the body of a young woman – thought to have drowned – was found floating in the Seine river in Paris. The corpse was taken to the local morgue, which was a popular attraction at the time, and put on display in case anyone could identify the person it belonged to. Instead, in an uncomfortable development to a story that has since been acknowledged as deeply creepy, the pathologist on duty became so taken with the young woman's beauty and innocence that he had a death mask made before she was buried.

The cast from L’Inconnue de la Seine, ""the unknown woman of the Seine"", in which the woman seems to be smiling contentedly with her lips pursed, was subsequently turned into a popular artwork. The work inspired sculptors, writers and painters, and was displayed on the walls of the houses of ordinary people, until, one day – over half a century after its unknown subject died – a Norwegian toy manufacturer decided to use the face for a lifelike resuscitation doll he was working on. ""Resusci Annie"", sometimes known as ""rescue Annie"", was born, and it's been estimated that the CPR courses she has helped with have saved some 2.5 million people from cardiac arrest.

The modern era

With changing attitudes to death and the growing popularity of photography in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, the practice of making death masks gradually fell out of fashion. People just didn't need them anymore when they could look at a photo of their lost loved ones instead.

Today the practise of making death masks has largely disappeared. But some artists are still keeping it alive through their own modern interpretations.

One example is the ""death mask"" series created by Tracey Emin. The English artist is famous for creating honest, sometimes shocking works that tell her own story, and the four impressions – which she took of her own face – have been described as ironic and autobiographical. They also challenge the historical expectation that death masks were created for men.

Another modern take is a work by the sculptor Robert Gober, who preserved the memory of his beloved dog, Paco, by moulding its snout and then blending this with a cast of his own face. The cartoonish result was Gober's way of preserving this ancient tradition – and who knows, it might just catch on.

Many brands are courting consumers during Lunar New Year, but some have failed spectacularly (Credit: Getty Images)

Companies often make crucial cultural missteps that alienate consumers during one of the biggest spending events of the year.

International businesses have long capitalised on the spending surge around Lunar New Year. People who mark the massive global celebration – primarily people of eastern and south-eastern Asian backgrounds – represent a significant market opportunity.

For instance, during the week-long Lunar New Year celebration in 2023, China witnessed a 30% increase in tourism revenue from the previous year, reaching 375.8bn yuan ($52.7bn; $41.8bn). Meanwhile, according to the General Statistics Office, in January 2024, Vietnam saw its total retail sales of goods and consumer service revenues reach 524.1bn Vietnamese dong ($21.5bn; £17bn), marking an 8.1% increase from the previous year, driven by heightened consumer shopping activity in anticipation of Tết.

To get a slice of the Lunar New Year revenue pie, many companies throughout the years have launched targeted marketing campaigns to engage with Asian consumers – including high-profile global brands.

For Lunar New Year 2024, which falls on 10 February, Apple released its Chinese New Year-themed film Little Garlic, shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Burberry introduced a capsule collection celebrating the Year of the Dragon, touted by brand ambassadors Tang Wei and Chen Kun in Chengdu, China. Coca-Cola released its Tết campaign in Vietnam, featuring the Golden Dragon symbol, inspired by the historic Dragon from the Lý Dynasty.

Many people around the world have come to expect these ambitious brand campaigns – and companies have, in many cases, executed to the delight of customers. However, leveraging the Lunar New Year for commercial success isn't as simple as using the colour red or employing Asian ambassadors. As brands of all sizes have begun to venture into Lunar New Year market, some have made crucial cultural missteps that have damaged brand reputation and impacted their market share in a profitable window.

In 2019, Dolce & Gabbana faced widespread backlash for an advertising campaign that featured a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. The controversy escalated quickly, as many consumers perceived the advert as mocking Chinese culture. It led to the cancellation of a highly anticipated fashion show in Shanghai as well as mass boycotting. The mistake has left lasting consequences: the brand's reputation is still shaky in the massive Chinese consumer market.

That same year, Burberry's first Lunar New Year campaign came under scrutiny. Critics said its stark portrait of a Chinese family came off as ""creepy"" – in direct contrast to the joyful, family-centric celebrations core to Lunar New Year festivities. ""It showed a lack of empathy from the brand,"" says Tana Licsandru, a senior lecturer in marketing and researcher on inclusive branding at Queen Mary University of London.

Licsandru says brands that miss the mark often fail to understand and reflect the audience's lived experiences and perspectives – which can make them look culturally insensitive at best. ""The way to do it is to bring people from the targeted communities to look at the adverts and see whether your message comes across the right way.""

Mistakes like these are missed opportunities for brands to connect meaningfully with their audiences during a season when spirits are high and wallets are open. ""They fail because they don't employ the right people or only make a tokenistic effort,"" adds Licsandru.

Yet brands are becoming more adept at navigating cultural nuances by partnering with external stakeholders to bridge the gap between Western and Eastern markets. These businesses that often operate in target markets can help prevent brands from cultural insensitivies, and design campaigns to resonate with Asian communities and respect their diverse customs.

We see many examples of brands just ticking the box. For example, superficial showing of large families, but that doesn't make you stand out – Ranjana Singh

This is particularly important, because Lunar New Year is a wide term for a holiday celebrated in different ways across different cultures. A common misconception, for instance, is that Lunar New Year is solely a Chinese holiday – when it is actually celebrated in Indonesia, Singapore, the Korean Peninsula and more. And each market may be looking for different things both in terms of products and their positioning.

In Vietnam, for instance, ""consumers are keen on online shopping and discovering products from abroad, influenced heavily by word-of-mouth"", says Peter Huynh, founder of Intelligence4Start, a Melbourne-based agency that helps international brands enter the Vietnamese market. In China, many consumers often snap up luxury goods; Q1 luxury sales are expected to soar, in part due to purchases during Lunar New Year.

""To understand what, why and how people celebrate is very important,"" says Ranjana Singh, Vietnam and Indonesia chairperson of WPP, a global marketing and communications company. ""We see many examples of brands just ticking the box. For example, superficial showing of large families, but that doesn't make you stand out.""

Although emerging brands may tempted to enter the market during the flurry of Lunar New Year spending, Huynh cautions the timing might not be ideal, especially for newcomers to the Asian market.

Competition is high, he says, and not all products align with Lunar New Year customs – so the product-market fit may not be there, which can be glaringly obvious with so many eyes on Asia-focused campaigns. ""If you're a new player in the market, you shouldn't take the risk by coming into Asia during Lunar New Year. You may wait until the low season to stand out and grab the consumer's attention.""","It's easy to enter the Asian market during Lunar New Year.

San Francisco Chronicle food critic MacKenzie Chung Fegan heads on a food tour of Chinatown, from splurging at Mister Jiu's to mooncakes at Garden Bakery for Lunar New Year or anytime.

San Francisco can't help but charm visitors and locals alike with its rolling hills, candy-coloured Victorian homes and diverse neighbourhoods. Its Chinatown is the US' oldest, dating to 1848. Today, its iconic jade green tiled Dragon Gate signals both a classic San Francisco photo op and the gateway to some of the best food in the city.

The SpeciaList MacKenzie Chung Fegan loves food. Formerly the editor of Bon Appétit, Bay Area native Fegan grew up in an illustrious restaurant family and has landed in San Francisco after 20 years in New York City to serve as the lead food critic for The San Francisco Chronicle.

We spoke to MacKenzie Chung Fegan – the lead food critic for the San Francisco Chronicle – to get her insider take on where to eat – and drink – in San Francisco's Chinatown. ""One of the things I like about Chinatown is that it is, of course, very touristy, but it's also where Chinese people go to shop,"" said Fegan. ""Stockton Street is kind of a main thoroughfare; there's a lot of vegetable markets or fish markets, and you'll see both aunties doing their shopping for the week but also people from restaurants going early in the morning and to make sure that they're getting the best produce. It's a living, breathing Chinatown.""

Opened in 2022, the Chinatown-Rose Pak MUNI station at the corner of Stockton Street makes it easier than ever to explore this bustling neighbourhood. ""I think wandering is the best way to explore Chinatown,"" said Fegan. ""Because you literally will round a corner and be, like, wow, I'm hit with the smell of garlic, or the smell of fresh baked pineapple buns. Just go into any place that looks good, that smells good, that has a line of people outside. That's generally how I do it.""

To narrow it down, here are six of Mackenzie Chung Fegan's tasty picks for your next visit to San Francisco's Chinatown.

1. Best mooncakes: Garden Bakery

Start your Chinatown visit with a stop at a bakery, to choose from rows of beautifully moulded sweets and breads, like Fegan's pick, neighbourhood stalwart Garden Bakery.

Lunar New Year in Chinatown San Francisco's Chinatown is especially fun to visit during Lunar New Year. ""There's red lanterns strung up everywhere,"" said Fegan. ""There's lots of small alleys in Chinatown as well, which is very atmospheric and beautiful. You'll see lion dances from local troupes go down the street, which is so fun. There'll be firecrackers."" Keep an eye out for lunar new year treats. ""A common theme in general is foods that like look like money,"" said Fegan. ""Mandarin oranges, kumquats, long noodles celebrate longevity. But the jiaozi dumplings are among the most iconic Lunar New Year foods and it's really fun. Everybody can get together and make them… it's a real family activity.""

""It's a hole in the wall bakery,"" she said. ""You're gonna find old timers with paper coffee cups sitting at no frills tables…. everything's very reasonably priced.""

While Garden Bakery rolls out an array of Chinese sweets, Fegan likes it for its mooncakes. The intricately designed filled cakes are most often consumed for the Mid- Autumn festival – the second largest holiday in China after Lunar New Year – but customers will find them year-round here.

""Mooncakes are very traditional, but they can be dry,"" observed Fegan. ""They can be not that delicious, but I think Garden Bakery's are very good. Their red bean mooncake in particular is a favourite. They're pressed, they don't use moulds. They use a pneumatic press now but they're very intricate, beautiful to behold and quite tasty as well.""

Fegan also enjoys the bakery's pineapple buns – fluffy large buns with a characteristic cracked custard top. ""You can get pineapple buns for $1 [.80p] – a great deal,"" said Fegan. ""… and they do they do mini mooncakes as well for, like, $3.50 [£2.75]. So those are a lower commitment way to sample a traditional mooncake.""

2. Best quick lunch worth standing in line for: Hon's Wun-Tun House

Few things comfort the soul like a steaming bowl of Hong Kong-style wonton soup, and the line outside the legendary Hon's Wun-Tun House proves it.

""Hon's Wun-Tun House is a favourite,"" said Fegan of the vintage eatery, which opened on Kearny Street in 1972. ""You'll see people line up there around lunchtime. The vibe is very serviceable. You're going in for a fast lunch, you're probably taking things to go. It's pretty bare bones. It's nothing fancy on the inside.""

And yet, Hon's Wun-Tun House is so popular that it opened a second location in 2023 – and this one has a line snaking outside, too. The menu offers a large variety of noodle and dumpling soups, but the wonton soup with its freshly made wontons and delicate noodles remains the star. ""Yeah, the wonton soup is the is the thing to get here for sure,"" said Fegan.

3. Best view: Empress by Boon

San Francisco's Chinatown is full of interesting nooks and details at street level, but to take it all in at once, Fegan likes Empress by Boon, Michelin-starred Chef Ho Chee Boon's namesake restaurant on the sixth floor of the historical Empress of China banquet hall.

""It's fine dining. It's a five-course set menu,"" said Fegan. ""It's kind of over the top because the music's clubby, but the food is good. The view is really what sets it apart. You can look out over Chinatown, and you can see the streets all lit up with the red lanterns… And then you have a view of Coit Tower into the distance, so you can see Chinatown all the way up into North Beach and then Coit Tower lit up on the hill.""

Empress by Boon's set menu features elegant yet approachable modern Cantonese dishes, like crispy pumpkin puffs and braised squab breast. ""They do a dish that I thought was excellent,"" said Fegan. ""It's one shrimp dumpling and one squid dumpling and it comes in a hot sour broth… the shrimp [dumpling] looks like a koi fish and the squid looks like a tiny squid. [It's] artful the way that they have shaped these dumplings to look like a squid and koi fish swimming in the broth.""

4. Best for groups: City View Restaurant

When visiting Chinatown with a hungry group, Fegan recommends stopping for dim sum – its endless bevvy of small plates made for sharing. ""You want to be able to try a bunch of things, and so if you go with a group, you can try most of the menu and not feel like you're missing out,"" she explained. One of her San Francisco Chinatown group-friendly dim sum picks is City View Restaurant.

""Everything's delicious,"" she said. ""They have char sieu bao (barbecue pork steamed buns). Often it's served as steamed buns, but these are big with a little crackly topping and they're really good.""

City View Restaurant is a long-time San Francisco Chinatown favourite, and in April of 2023, moved from its historical 662 Commercial Street address to a new spot on the ground floor of 33 Walter U. Lum Place. It's still serving a robust menu of Cantonese dim sum favourites, from savoury chicken feet to delicate shrimp-filled har gow dumplings to fluffy stuffed bao steamed buns.

""This is a place that's painful to go to with only one other person or solo,"" said Fegan.

5. Best splurge: Mister Jiu's

Chinatowns serve some of the most delicious food at low prices, but if you're in the mood to splurge, head to Fegan's pick: Mister Jiu's, Chef Brandon Jew's elegant Michelin-starred Waverly Place eatery. ""It's expensive. It's fancy,"" said Fegan, of the restaurant's seasonal Cantonese-inspired fare. ""But the food is delicious. It's creative. It is modern and tradition fused together.""

Fegan, who is a staunch advocate of supporting local businesses and Chinatown's new wave, noted that Chef Jew is part of San Francisco Chinatown's latest generation of chefs.

""His family's from Chinatown, but he himself is a trained chef,"" said Fegan. ""He's cooked at some fancy places, and he wanted to come back home and open up a restaurant in his community, [and] people who have cooked at his restaurant have gone on to open their own things. One example is his former pastry chef Melissa Chow, who has a bakery down downstairs on the weekend. It's called Grand Opening. You can pre-order [online], and on Saturdays and Sundays she sells her pastries downstairs for Mister Jiu's.""

Mister Jiu's currently offers a modern banquet-style tasting menu, with a mix of seasonally inspired communal and individual dishes, frequently featuring an elegant spin on whole Peking duck.

""People are coming to celebrate,"" said Fegan. ""A lot of people have waited a long time for this reservation.""

6. Best dive bar: Li Po Cocktail Lounge

Cap off the evening by visiting another old school Chinatown establishment: the Li Po Cocktail Lounge. ""It's been open since 1937,"" said Fegan of the historic dive bar on Grant Avenue. ""The outside has a neon sign. It's very atmospheric.""

She noted that the regulars haunting the cave-like red-lit bar aren't locals – ""You'll see a lot of tourists and people coming from other neighbourhoods. The clientele is not Chinese by and large. But the servers are, the bartenders are, and you can get a shot of baijiu (Chinese liquor) and a beer, and they also are famous for their Chinese Mai Tai.""

The numbingly sweet ""Chinese"" Mai Tai at Li Po Cocktail Lounge – made with Chinese wine as its special ingredient as well as rum and pineapple juice – was invented by the bar's current owner Kenneth Lee and is notoriously powerful. ""[Li Po is] such a vibe,"" said Fegan. ""It's such a great atmosphere. It's just a very old school dive bar and worth a stop. Or at least worth poking your head in. ""

British and American quietly luxurious interiors styles have merged over the centuries. What are the elements of this ultra-rich, ""old money"" look, and what makes it so timeless?

The stratospherically rich famously love to wear under-the-radar European fashion labels that only their peers will clock – a tacit affirmation of their superior social status. Now this stealth-wealth aesthetic is being echoed by a style of interior décor that is equally beloved by the super-affluent. It is explored in a new book Quiet Luxury, featuring 18 homes in Paris, Madrid, Dubai, New York, Melbourne, Stockholm, Athens, and Knokke and Hooogstraten in Belgium.

In his foreword to the book, Wim Pauwels writes: ""Quiet Luxury refers to understated architecture and interiors made with very high-quality materials. All interiors are a non-ostentatious take on luxury, with a focus on exquisite materials and fabrics, muted colours, timeless designs, pared-back chic. It is all about developing a personal style that the architects, interior designers and homeowners believe in, far away from volatile trends.""

Pauwels tells BBC Culture: ""People increasingly value quality, craftsmanship and longevity over disposable items. This is a reflection of a deeper cultural shift towards sustainability, minimalism and a focus on well-made, enduring pieces. Quiet luxury emphasises simplicity, and a connection to natural materials.""

Don't be fooled by the look's apparent cultural neutrality and homogeneity, however: in the main, the style slaloms between referencing American and European modernism. Author and cultural commentator Peter York traces the pedigree of this aesthetic in both fashion and interiors to well-heeled East Coast Americans, epitomised by the moneyed milieu portrayed in the hit TV series Succession – although its protagonist Logan Roy is self-made, the series is inspired by such established media dynasties as the Hearsts, Mercers and Sulzbergers.

This style, founded on people's idea of European subtlety, is now international – Peter York

""It's a small, important, fading minority of mostly Northeastern preppy types of old money in American terms,"" says York. ""Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, who married a British toff, spent a lot of time in London in the 1930s. The Kennedys were tribal with the Devonshires. American plutocrats love British clothes, especially men's clothing. And they love our interiors. Clive Aslet's book, An Exuberant Catalogue of Dreams: The Americans who Revived the Country House in Britain, is about American owners of English country houses who restore English country houses, making them perfect, if sanitised. To be fair, they often do this very well.""

He sees the English country-house look as an early variant of quiet luxury. Its 20th-Century incarnation was a transatlantic confection, popularised by US heiress and interior decorator Nancy Lancaster, who collaborated with John Fowler, co-founder of quintessentially British decorating firm Colefax & Fowler. She helped cement Anglo-American ties by buying the business in 1948.

York believes quiet luxury has less influence now in the US because Americans are becoming less Anglophile. ""It's a shrinking sector but won't disappear,"" says York, who is not a fan of the look. ""This style, founded on people’s idea of European subtlety, is now international anyway – and it's fantastically boring and bland.""

Architect Richard Parr, whose practice, Richard Parr Associates, designs many rural homes in Britain, sees Italian fashion and interiors as a major influence: ""This understated style is very much that of Giorgio Armani. Among the uber-affluent, it's much classier not to broadcast logos. As you'd expect, the Armani Hotel in Milan, which opened in 2011, and is housed in a 1930s palazzo, is the original take on quiet luxury greige. It's stood the test of time, never been refurbished.""

Clean lines

Simplicity fused with opulent elements were espoused by modernist and mid-century architects and designers. An iconic example is Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion of 1929. While uncluttered and free of ornamentation, it feels luxurious thanks to its use of rich materials, including dark green Tinian marble and rust onyx, some used for structural elements such as walls. A taste for measured luxury is also evident in its furniture, notably van der Rohe's Barcelona chair with its caramel leather-upholstered seat and chromed steel frame.

Its primary characteristics lie in a use of simple elements, clean lines and understated materials – it's a philosophy that whispers rather than screams luxury – Pierre Petit

""Quiet luxury can be seen as a contemporary interpretation of the 'less is more' principle coined by Mies van der Rohe,"" says Pierre Petit, co-founder of Paris interior design firm Atelier DAAA. The book Quiet Luxury features its renovation of a Haussmannian apartment in Paris. ""Its primary characteristics lie in a use of simple elements, clean lines and understated materials, aiming to be free of non-essential embellishments,"" he explains. ""If its manifestation in fashion recalls Shiv Roy's camel cashmere wardrobe, its equivalent in décor could be a chair wrapped in mohair velvet or [modernist designer] Charlotte Perriand's Berger stools. It's a philosophy that whispers rather than screams luxury.""

Atelier DAAA's apartment highlights another characteristic of quiet luxury – it doesn't necessarily banish classical, decorative elements. ""Its moulded ceilings are accentuated by marble-clad arches,"" continues Petit. ""In general, choice of materials is crucial – metals are bronzed or softened not polished; woods remain raw and untreated, velvets look muted not glossy.""

Another project in the book called Stairway to Heaven, also in Paris, designed by Véronique Cotrel, takes its cue from US mid-century modernism. ""I drew a lot of inspiration from Californian 1960s modernism, which advocated clean interiors and natural materials – wood combined with stone. It's minimalist in style yet capitalises on its many windows, which we enlarged to create an inside-outside feel. We installed mirrors on the sides of window recessesto bring more light and a feeling of nature indoors.""

""In a time when we're saturated with images and notifications, I attach importance to emptiness,"" adds Cotrel. ""I like to create interiors that don't necessarily have usual functions but have what I call aesthetic functions, such as clear perspectives that are easy on the eye and enhance natural light and a sense of space.""

The quiet luxury trend can also be seen as a reaction against the overblown, visual cacophony of maximalism. While flamboyant interiors can be thrillingly theatrical, their appeal arguably palls fast – fun to dip into temporarily in a hotel, say, but not to be embraced permanently. In the light of pressing environmentalist concerns, a layered, more-is-more philosophy seems wasteful, self-indulgent and likely to date quickly.

""There's been a noticeable reaction against ostentatious interiors,"" says Margit Argus, founder of architects practice Studio Argus, based in Tallinn, Estonia. ""A desire for simplicity and a thoughtful choice of materials signifies a collective yearning for authenticity. This movement is a response to our fast-paced world, with individuals seeking solace in calm spaces.""

Influenced by new circumstances and contemporary concerns, the style is becoming increasingly popular. ""The trend aligns with a growing emphasis on wellness and mindfulness,"" says Pauwels. ""It's also propelled by a desire for serenity amid turbulent times.""

Some believe a commitment among designers and their clients for sustainability is increasingly stoking a demand for more enduring materials and a comparatively timeless aesthetic. ""The adoption of a quiet colour palette is intricately intertwined with concerns for the environment,"" says Argus. ""The neutral tones of quiet luxury frequently originate from a growing use of eco-friendly materials.""

Quiet, refined, calm spaces with considered elements and open spaces are what ultimately feel soothing – Nicole Hollis

Some established interior designers have always favoured a pared-back look, in the belief that our homes are a haven that cocoon us from the frenetic pace of public life, and don't see it as a passing trend. ""This has never been a trend for us but something I've always gravitated towards,"" says Nicole Hollis, a San Francisco-based interior designer who has undertaken residential projects in the US and Europe. Her interiors are uncluttered and feature striking sculptural furniture and neutral colours, such as charcoal grey and ivory.

Studio Argus

She believes the pandemic made people more aware of the serenity home life provides. ""A key question for us now is 'How does this space make me feel?' Quiet, refined, calm spaces with considered elements and open spaces are what ultimately feel soothing. Key ingredients of the style are symmetry, an avoidance of diagonal lines, natural materials and a muted palette, which quiet our senses and allow us to recharge. I'm attracted to art that can overwhelm the senses but I wouldn't want to live in a space that feels like this.""

Consistent use of materials is important, she says. ""We carve elements from the same block of stone or marble to give continuity to a space,"" she says. ""For example, we've worked on homes in the US where we've gone to Italy to source marble, and selected a block that is laser-cut for all slabs, counters, sinks and doors. The veining matches throughout and shows a consideration for fine detail.""

Historical precedents for the style, she adds, include architect Piero Portaluppi's Villa Necchi in Milan – a mansion that was pioneering for melding Italian rationalism, Art Deco and state-of-the-art creature comforts, such as central heating, electric blinds and a dumb waiter.

Identifying a house's key qualities and bringing them out via carefully considered design details is another characteristic of the look, says Richard Parr: ""In my projects, I draw the design out of the place itself. I use locally sourced materials that don't jar with a house's environment – and in inventive ways. Our interiors are very architectural – we keep to the fabric of the building, only adding a simple layer. For a house in Suffolk, we are installing glazed ceramic tiles inspired by amazing colours I saw on a local river shore.""

What tips can designers give to achieve the style in an accessible way? ""Make sustainable choices when selecting furniture, and mix old and new pieces,"" counsels Clémence Pirajean, co-founder of London-based interior and product design studio Pirajean Lees. ""Avoid trends. Instead create a look that's personal and tailored to your lifestyle. Incorporate objects you've collected on your travels abroad. Accumulating items over time will help establish your home so it doesn’t look brand new but feels timeless and lived-in.""

Rasmus Graversen, a scion of the Graversen family that established Danish furniture brand Fredericia in 1911, suggests allowing furniture to age naturally. ""With furniture and other homeware it's about showing you dare to let them acquire patina. For example, instead of putting lacquer on brass to stop it rusting, let it age naturally.""

The quiet luxury aesthetic might seem beyond the reach of most of us, but it also springs from a mindset that believes less can be more, says Jo Littlefair of London-based interior design practice Goddard Littlefair. ""An accessible entry into this aesthetic is a more mindful approach,"" she advises. ""Decluttering is paramount. A few standout pieces can transform a room. It's a style embodied by thoughtful curation.""

By Christine Ro Features correspondent

With the top contenders for the US presidential election in 2024 both well past the typical retirement age, science says there is both pros and cons to having older leaders.

Pauline Newman, currently 96, holds a lifetime position as a US federal judge. Though she wants to carry on working, she's in the midst of lawsuits with colleagues who want her to retire.

The US has become a hotspot for debates about whether people in the political sphere can ever be too old to lead. The top contenders for the 2024 US presidential election are Joe Biden – who turned 81 in 2023 and is more than twice as old as the median American; and 77-year-old Donald Trump, who is a more than a decade beyond the ""Normal Retirement Age"" – the age at which Americans can receive their full retirement benefits. In the US Senate, Republian Chuck Grassley is the oldest sitting senator at the age of 90, followed by Senator Bernie Sanders at 82.

The spotlight on Biden's age increased in intensity in February 2024 when Special Counsel Robert Hur described the US President as ""an elderly man with a poor memory"" in a report on a year-long inquiry into Biden's handling of classified files. The White House has described the report as ""inappropriate"".

Apart from discussions of the fact that gerontocracies – societies governed by older people – are typically not representative of their population, there are other concerns.

One key focus is mental fitness. Neuroscience and psychology suggest that cognitive performance varies widely as people grow older, making it tricky to determine whether someone can be too old to lead. And while some skills tend to decline with age, others improve. Some ""super agers"" even possess the mental acuity of people many decades younger than themselves. So, how old is ""too old"" to lead – or is this the wrong question?

How does ageing affect the brain?

Brain volume diminishes over time. In healthy people, the prefrontal cortex is the region of the brain with the most age-related volume loss, of roughly 5% per decade. Through its connections to other parts of the brain, it helps manage executive function: a complex set of mental processes that has been likened to a thermostat or the conductor of a symphony. It's key to discussions of leadership capacities because it's involved in areas like problem-solving, goal-setting and impulse control.

Executive function declines gradually during a person's 30s, and this accelerates as we enter our 70s. White matter disease – a group of conditions caused by damage to the white matter in the brain – also contributes to executive dysfunction, and affects about a third of people aged 65 and older. Executive dysfunction can show up in reduced impulse control and increased repetition of thoughts and behaviours.

A significant proportion of people over 65 have some impairment of executive function, ""I think as a general break point, 65 is reasonable,"" says Mark Fisher, who directs the Center for Neuropolitics at the University of California, Irvine. Other structural changes in the brain become solidified around this age as well – mental processing speed has been shown to decline from around the age of 60 in a study using US data.

You might also like:

The very loose threshold of 65 applies to the US, where the overall life expectancy at birth is 76. However, it may be different in countries with markedly different life expectancies and health systems (and there is also substantial racial and other inequality within the US that affects longevity). For example, the life expectancy for men in the US is 73. This is lower than in the top countries, but much higher than the life expectancy of 60 for men in Cameroon, whose president, 90-year-old Paul Biya, is said to be the world's oldest national leader.

Life expectancy at birth doesn't tell the full story of longevity, as this number is brought down by factors like infant mortality. For example, an 80-year-old in the US could expect to live another decade. This means that in reality, there is no hard and fast rule for when, or even if, a person will be significantly affected by the decline of executive function – particularly when you factor in that we don't all have the same proficiency to begin with.

What are the benefits of an older brain?

Fisher explains that in general, averages can obscure expectations of healthy longevity and cognitive fitness, given what he calls the ""tremendous individual variability"" in executive function. ""The battery of testing would be the best way to formally determine one's executive function, but there is going to be wide variation in terms of how individuals function,"" Fisher says.

One differentiator is comorbidities: multiple conditions like heart disease, high cholesterol, and hypertension (high blood pressure). All of these can impact brain function, particularly executive function. And while ageing does not always come with illness, it makes it more likely.

According to Fisher, ""hypertension is, probably along with ageing itself, the most important, most impactful factor on brain ageing as a whole and executive function as well"". Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension is an important area of intervention to protect brain health. And positively, this is an area where treatments and knowledge are regularly improving, Fisher says.

There's also variation in which parts of the brain can compensate for others that show some age-related damage. While the brain is generally very plastic, and many of us can partially make up for disruptions in one part of the brain by enlisting other parts of the network, others will experience a failure of compensation along the lines of Alzheimer's disease, explains Mark Mapstone, a translational neuroscientist at University of California, Irvine.

However, it's not all bad news. There are some aspects where older brains actually show better performance. While the ability to take in new information declines much earlier, the ability to direct and act on information can improve well into a person's 70s.

So, while 70-year-olds will probably process new information more slowly than 30-year-olds, they may do better at synthesising it. Mapstone says that 60-year-olds typically have better vocabulary than 20-year-olds, and can thus substitute words better. For example, one study found that vocabulary scores increase until a person's mid-60s.

""What happens with older brains is they get better at what is called crystallised intelligence,"" explains Rose McDermott, who specialises in political psychology at Brown University. ""You have these kind of established schemas and ways of thinking about things. And you're able to integrate new information into existing structures much more readily and in many cases creatively than you can when you're younger because you don't sit on the same degree of knowledge base.""

What happens when you age

Does politics make unique cognitive demands?

Some people, known as ""super agers"", retain the cognitive functions of much younger people. These are people in their 80s and older with the cognitive health of those two to three decades younger. Super agers show larger, healthier neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a part of the brain critical to memory. Unsurprisingly, they do better on memory tests than their peers.

Physical activity, mental stimulation and social connection are all important to preserving brain tissue and brain function. Political leadership certainly provides at least the mental challenge and social connection parts, and powerful people are also likely to have many privileges, including financial security and access to excellent healthcare. Some scientists consider leaders like Biden to be super agers.

However, while ageing presents some cognitive challenges in general, it may present extra issues for political leaders. ""Cognitive flexibility in thinking and problem solving is an essential form of cognition for political leaders to excel at in order to make good-quality decisions under uncertainty and risk,"" notes Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. ""These types of decisions are also often time limited."" However, cognitive flexibility usually dwindles over time.

Some mental changes associated with age could be particularly alarming to voters. For one thing, it appears that brain ageing can affect political attitudes. A novel study by Fisher and colleagues, of Southern California retirees with a mean age of 95, found that while political ideology remained consistent overall over a six-month period, people with cognitive impairment showed inconsistency between their political orientation and policy choices. Fisher comments of this finding: ""It does appear to be that this is a consequence of cognitive impairment, that one's political behaviour becomes relatively unanchored from one's stated policy.""

However, ""neuropolitics"", the combined field of neuroscience and political science, has its critics. Some disability scholars argue that it's simplistic to find biological explanations for political behaviours, for instance.

Should political leaders undergo cognitive screening?

Given the evidence of the effects of ageing on the brain, Fisher and some colleagues from different disciplines are calling for cognitive screenings for politicians, which would not necessarily depend on age. ""We view cognitive screening as something analogous to the financial disclosures that politicians are often expected to make,"" he says.

Cognitive function is mainly assessed through a neuropsychological evaluation – a set of standardised tests that can be so detailed and extensive that they are spread out over several days, Mapstone explains. Manijeh Berenji, an occupational medicine specialist and member of the clinical faculty at UC Irvine, believes that these assessments of politicians can be feasible and fair.

However, the concept is highly controversial and politicised. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has been leading calls for politicians over the age of 75 to undergo mental competency tests. But the approach has been criticised as ageist and difficult to implement. At the start of 2024, Haley went further by launching an series of politcal adverts that focused on Biden's and Trump's ages, including one that depitced the pair as the lead characters in the 1993 film ""Grumpy Old Men"".

Hans Förstl, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at the Technical University of Munich, believes that it would be hard for an assessment to capture the cognitive complexity and demands of being a head of state. ""Activities of daily living, cognitive performance during daily routines and challenges is decisive, not the performance during a shorter or longer test,"" Förstl says. ""The demands on a head of state are exceptional in every respect; no test would be able to gauge that mix of fitness, intelligence, experience and wisdom.""

McDermott, for her part, thinks that though the tests are sufficiently sound, in the US the idea is a non-starter for political reasons. Given the polarised nature of beliefs around certain politicians, she wonders, ""If they passed, would the public believe it?""

However, others disagree. According to a poll by the Associated Press and the research organisation Norc Center for Public Affairs, the majority of voters see US President Joe Biden's age as a significant concern. Meanwhile, a recent survey by CBS and the data analytics firm YouGov found that the majority of respondents thought it would be ""too demanding"" for someone to hold elected office as the US president over the age of 75 – which would rule out both Biden and Trump.

Whatever the public decide, it's hard to imagine that cognitive testing will finally lay the debate to rest.

Employees who once clamoured to work for Big Tech companies are changing their tunes as layoffs proliferate and perks are cut (Credit: Getty Images)

Once the pinnacle of employment, Big Tech is finding its star tarnishing among layoffs and cutbacks. Workers across the industry are questioning their next moves.

Michael says he joined his Big Tech company in spring 2021 to test himself against the best software engineers in the world. ""They do some very complicated projects: when you join them, you're supposedly joining the best. You feel you're working somewhere that raises your brand value as a person.""

Initially, the move went well. Michael says he got to work on high-impact features, testing his mettle against senior developers. The perks also helped. ""It was a typical Big Tech company in that it offered huge benefits, with a great work-life balance,"" he says. ""Compared to my past employers, it was a breeze: there was free food, wellness expenses and health insurance. And the people were amazing – it was a nice working environment, if at times a little cult-ish.""

But the first sign something was changing came in March 2022. Amid the economic slowdown, the free laundry service was taken away. Soon there were more cuts – the timing of dinners for workers putting in late hours changed, conflicting with the final free shuttle scheduled to leave the New York campus. Employees had to effectively pick between free food and a free ride home. ""Folks complained – particularly the younger ones. It was a very pampered place.""

Months later, cuts to perks were followed by cuts to jobs – Michael was one of 11,000 employees let go in November that year, amid a broader tech slowdown and industry-wide layoffs. His next move was to leave Big Tech entirely. He now works in ""Big Finance"", for a major investment bank. It's a job that still offers interesting projects, says Michael, and he feels he has comparatively greater job security. ""If you'd have asked me before, I'd have said I'd work for another 'Faang' company next. But there's a world outside Big Tech.""

Up until recently, tech roles – particularly among major players such as Meta, Alphabet and Amazon – were often considered some of the most desirable jobs available, offering candidates six-figure salaries, lavish perks and the prospect of being at innovation's forefront. But since summer 2022, the sector has been rife with cuts, layoffs and uncertainty. In some cases, leaders have also cracked down on remote work, making the return to office a disciplinary issue.

A recovery feels distant. According to industry tracker Layoffs.fyi, 23,670 workers were laid off across 85 tech companies in January 2024 alone, including Microsoft, Amazon, eBay and Google. And it means some workers are beginning to look for jobs outside the sector they once competed to work in.

'Tech was the place to be'

Before layoffs, tech companies were more renowned for workplace cultures that serviced employees with free benefits and premium amenities in state-of-the art offices. But gourmet chefs and meditation rooms weren't introduced just to keep workers on site for as long as possible – they were a means of attracting talent. Scott Dobroski, career trends expert at Indeed, in San Francisco, says candidates – particularly in tech – are attuned to employer branding and company culture.

This changed following the pandemic. As the economy faltered in spring 2022, rising inflation and interest rates curbed companies' growth. This initially led to hiring freezes, and then industry-wide layoffs in late 2022, which are ongoing. ""Covid-19 was a once-in-a-generation event that changed companies' trajectories, overestimating demand and sending them into hiring sprees,"" says Dobroski. ""After coming too strong out the gate in 2021, tech companies had to suddenly pull back their recruitment.""

I no longer feel inspired, or that 'buzz' when I first stepped into the office – Alessandra

The tech sector has consequently become less desirable for many workers. According to Indeed's Best Jobs of 2024. Measured by salary, flexibility and growth, only three in its top 25 are tech roles, versus 11 in its 2023 edition.

""While tech jobs continue to command high salaries and offer above-average levels of flexible working, they've fallen significantly in terms of growth,"" says Dobroski. ""Job seekers typically want to join companies that are flourishing, in which they feel they can grow. But when layoffs are announced, that doesn't only reduce opportunities to move in the job market – it harms employers’ reputations and signals uncertainty.""

It's not just job seekers put off by tech roles. Current employees in the industry report feeling disenchanted.

Alessandra works for a blockchain technology firm in London. She says she chose tech as her career when she first stepped into her employer's corporate headquarters as an intern. ""I was wowed by the office – it made it feel as though tech was the place to be. It was its fast-paced and innovative nature that stood out most to me: as though I could be part of something new.""

Like many in the sector, Alessandra's firm has been impacted by the tech slowdown. By February 2023, one of its blockchain product offerings was closed. Layoffs have continued ever since – her team has now been slashed fivefold. Employees are also mandated to be in the office three days a week – or face the consequences. ""My day alternates from being super intense when it seems things are 'taking off', to long periods of doing absolutely nothing,"" she says.

Her disillusionment extends beyond her company and to the industry itself. ""It's seemingly luck whichever part of tech you fall in. Right now, AI is taking off, so everyone else feels like they're getting left behind. It's not just my company: the market itself doesn't know what it needs to do to succeed, or where it's headed. I no longer feel inspired, or that 'buzz' when I first stepped into the office.""

'The glory days will be back'

Dobroski believes that excitement for jobs in the tech sector will only return once the economy fully recovers, layoffs end and companies recommence hiring en masse.

Until then, only certain roles remain coveted. ""History has shown that when there's job growth, that's the signal there are opportunities for job seekers,"" he says. ""For now, there are areas within the industry that are still very attractive to tech talent, such as AI teams among both Big Tech and start-ups.""

Although he's left the industry, Michael says he'd still work for a Big Tech firm in the future. ""The benefits are great, and you're driven to work on big problems you can one day point to and say, 'I developed that'. The glory days will be back: a couple of years post-economic downturn and it'll be back to 2021. Tech talent is always going to be in short supply.""

But for now, many tech workers are beginning to look elsewhere. ""Most of my colleagues feel the same way: we're working towards something that's going nowhere,"" says Alessandra. ""And after seeing so many close colleagues suddenly be made redundant, or quit as a result, we've lost faith in what we're trying to achieve. Most of us are planning our exit strategies from the company – and some even from the industry.""","Big Tech jobs have lost their glamourBy Alex Christian Features correspondentGetty ImagesEmployees who once clamoured to work for Big Tech companies are changing their tunes as layoffs proliferate and perks are cut (Credit: Getty Images)Once the pinnacle of employment, Big Tech is finding its star tarnishing among layoffs and cutbacks.

Plump, spicy and juicy, these chorizo dumplings from the cookbook, Double Awesome Chinese Food, are accompanied by a white bean puree and coriander-infused oil.

Adding spicy chorizo to Chinese dumplings might be unconventional, but according to Boston Magazine, the savoury delight from Mei Mei Dumplings ""might just be the best two-bite morsel in town"".

People just love dumplings,"" said Chef Irene Li, who co-founded Mei Mei as a food truck in 2012 with older siblings Andrew and Margaret. Mei Mei, which translates to ""little sister"" in Mandarin, is a nod to one of the siblings' favourite foods growing up.

""Many of my favourite childhood memories are of making and eating dumplings in a kitchen full of noise and laughter and love,"" Li said. ""I also love that dumplings are present all over the world. We like to say that dumplings make the world go round because so many cultures have some kind of stuffed food: knishes, empanadas, tortellini, manti and on and on and on.""

Li's culinary roots go back to the China Garden Restaurant that her grandparents ran in White Plains, New York, from the 1950s to the '70s. It was renowned for what was then considered exotic delicacies and for its elegant Gourmet Room that featured the kind of cuisine served in aristocratic Chinese households.

China Garden closed before Li was born, but Li and her siblings seem to have inherited the same knack for food as their grandparents.

According to Li, ""Our dumplings at Mei Mei are an expression of our Chinese heritage and our love for local and seasonal food here in the Northeast. We use some traditional Chinese ingredients, but for the most part, our dumplings are unique, like our cheddar scallion potato dumplings, which I like to call our 'love letter' to the pierogi. They are definitively not Chinese, but they are authentic to us and the multicultural household we grew up in.""

Why chorizo? Li explained that she was first inspired during college when she worked in a butcher shop. ""There was always extra raw chorizo,"" she said. ""I loved taking it home and trying to find new and exciting things to do with it, and dumplings ended up being my favorite application!"" She sources the best chorizo she can find, using pork from heritage breed pigs that graze in the pastures of New York's Finger Lakes region.

During the pandemic, Li and new business partners reimagined the business as Mei Mei Dumpling Factory, Café & Classroom, serving the same unconventional dumplings but now also teaching people how to make them.

The chorizo dumplings are served on a smear of hummus or creamy white bean puree, adding what Li describs as ""a creamy foil to the piquancy of the chorizo spices"". Then they are drizzled with coriander oil and served hot.

Chorizo Dumplings recipe By Irene, Andrew and Margaret Li

Makes about 24 dumplings

This recipe can be streamlined by using store-bought hummus, pre-made dumpling wrappers and infused oil.

Ingredients For the bean puree: one 400g (15oz) can chickpeas or white beans, such as cannellini, drained and rinsed 2 garlic cloves, sliced ¼ small onion, minced ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil ½ tsp kosher salt a pinch of white pepper For the coriander oil: 1 bunch coriander, roughly chopped (or substitute parsley or chives) 210g (1 cup) neutral oil, such as canola For the dumplings: one 396g (14oz) pack of round dumpling wrappers or homemade Hot Water Dough (recipe below) 455g (1lb) raw (not cured) chorizo sausage, casings removed if necessary (you can substitute any seasoned, raw loose sausage) neutral oil, such as canola, for frying

Method

Step 1 Make the bean puree. In a small saucepan, combine the drained beans, garlic, onion and ⅔ cup water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Transfer the bean mixture to a blender and add the olive oil, salt and white pepper. Blend until smooth, thinning with an additional splash of water, if desired. Taste for seasoning. Serve warm. (The puree can be refrigerated for a couple of days and reheated to serve.)

Step 2 Make the coriander oil. Using a mortar and pestle, or a blender, combine the coriander and neutral oil and mix (or blend) until the herbs are completely pureed into the oil. For a clear oil, strain through cheesecloth, if desired. (The oil can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

Step 3 Assemble the dumplings. Have a small bowl of water nearby to help seal the wrappers if using store-bought wrappers. For a classic dumpling pleat, hold a wrapper in your left hand and place a spoonful of filling (about ¾ tbsp) into the centre with your right hand. As tempting as it might be to overstuff the dumpling, don't: the filling will squirt messily and make the folding process much more difficult.

Step 4 Fold the wrapper in half into a taco shape and start from the right side to pinch the wrapper shut. Dip a finger into the water and smear it around the edge of each wrapper before you fold so the dough sticks together when you pinch shut. Start by pinching the corner of one of the dumplings, then use your thumb and forefinger to create pleats, pinching and pleating until the entire dumpling is sealed, aiming for 5 to 6 pleats per dumpling (or more if you want to get fancy). The side closest to you should remain smooth and will gradually curve towards you into a crescent shape.

Step 5 On a large plate or sheet pan, arrange the dumplings in rows with a little space between each one. You can either cook the dumplings right away or freeze them. Once frozen, transfer the dumplings into freezer-safe containers for storage.

Step 6 Coat the bottom of a large nonstick frying pan (with a lid) with a layer of neutral oil (about 2 tbsp) and heat over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmery, carefully fill the pan with a single layer of dumplings (non-pleated side down), leaving a bit of room between each one. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown – you can pick one up to check.

Step 7 Turn the heat to medium and grab the lid and about ¼ cup water. Shielding yourself with the lid, pour the water into the hot pan – it will steam and sizzle, so be careful there isn't too much oil in the pan to splatter all over the place. Cover the pan and let the steam cook the top of the dumplings for 4 to 6 minutes (8 to 10 minutes if cooking from frozen).

Once the water has evaporated, the wrappers should be slightly translucent and the filling fully cooked. (If the dumplings are not cooked through, add a splash of water and cover again for a minute or two. Turn the heat up slightly, and the remaining oil in the bottom of the pan will re-crisp the bottom of the dumplings.)

Step 8 To serve, smear a heaping spoonful of the hummus/white bean puree onto a plate and place a few dumplings on top. Drizzle with coriander oil.

Tip You can substitute ready-made coriander-infused oil, if available.

Hot Water Dough

Makes enough dough for about 24 dumplings

Ingredients 270g (2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2g (¼ tsp) salt 1 cup water, boiled and cooled for about 1 minute

Method

Step 1 Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon, slowly stir in ¾ cup of the hot water until a ball is formed and all the flour is incorporated. If the flour in the bottom of the bowl is not sticking to the ball, slowly drizzle in more water 1 tsp at a time and continue to stir.

Step 2 When all the flour has come together in a ball and the dough is cool enough to handle, place it on a very lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 3-5 minutes. If necessary, add a sprinkle of flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or work surface. Place back in the bowl and cover with a damp cloth to rest for 30-60 minutes, so the gluten strands can relax and the dough is easier to shape.

Step 3 Using a sharp knife or dough cutter, slice the dough into four equal pieces and set one aside on a cutting board. Cover the remaining pieces with a damp towel so they don't dry out. Roll the dough with your hands to form a roughly 15cm (6in) long ""snake"". Chop the snake into six equal pieces. Turn each piece onto its side and flatten with your hand slightly, then use a dowel or rolling pin to flatten into circles approximately 2-3mm thick and 7-8cm (3in) in diameter. Repeat to make the other wrappers. The dough can rest in the fridge a day or two wrapped in lightly oiled plastic wrap. Bring to room temperature before folding dumplings.

Tip Depending on your heat, water and oil levels, you may need to add more water or oil, but you'll get the hang of it after some practice.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68270263,Aston Villa 1-2 Man Utd: 'Momentum' with Red Devils as they hunt down top-four rivals,['Author not found'],"Rasmus Hojlund joined Manchester United from Atalanta for £72m in August 2023

Legendary former Manchester United skipper Roy Keane is convinced a top-four finish is in sight, while manager Erik ten Hag has growing belief.

In points terms, United may only be three closer to the coveted top four following their win at Aston Villa on Sunday than they were after losing at Nottingham Forest on 30 December.

But the optics are with them.

Three Premier League victories in a row, including late winners at Wolves and now Villa Park after Scott McTominay settled a game United could easily have lost. Four successive triumphs in all competitions for the first time this season and winnable matches against Luton and Fulham to come.

This latest win leaves them just six points off fourth-placed Spurs and a point nearer Aston Villa in fifth, which could even be enough to seal Champions League football next season with the two most successful countries in Europe securing an extra spot in next year's revamped competition.

Keane is happy to turn the spotlight on the sides United are trying to chase down.

""They have the momentum,"" the Irishman told Sky Sports. ""The teams ahead of them - especially Aston Villa and Tottenham - will be worried. They are hunting them down.""

Former Manchester United full-back Gary Neville added: ""Man Utd could have been out of it today but they now within touching distance.""

Ten Hag does not do hyperbole. But he does do blunt analysis.

""We put ourselves in this situation and we have to catch up,"" he said. ""We can beat any opponent away or home but sometimes away we have to believe it more.

""We could have won in Arsenal, we deserved to win there, and we could have won in Liverpool, it is about belief and this team today believed we could win.""

Hojlund's on fire

Before the first meeting between United and Villa on Boxing Day, Rasmus Hojlund was still to score his first Premier League goal. More pertinently, he did not actually look like scoring one. His confidence appeared to be draining.

But as United roared back to turn a two-goal deficit into a thrilling 3-2 win, the 21-year-old secured victory by ramming home the loose ball after a Bruno Fernandes corner had struck John McGinn.

It is fair to say the goal has made Hojlund's season.

The Dane held his position in the centre of the Villa six-yard area on Sunday as Harry Maguire headed the ball back from Fernandes' corner. Ollie Watkins played Hojlund onside and the striker swept home.

He has now scored six in seven games and five in his last five Premier League games. The only player to achieve the latter feat at a younger age was Nicolas Anelka, who won the Premier League and FA Cup double with Arsenal in 1997-98.

""Every time Hojlund walks on to the pitch now he looks like he will believe he can score goals,"" Keane said.

""He is a different player to his former self. He is full of confidence and shows real desire. The fact he has had to play week in and week out has actually been a big help to him.""

Ten Hag might have wanted Harry Kane at the start of the summer but he has repeatedly defended United's decision to go for youth and invest £72m on signing Hojlund from Serie A outfit Atalanta.

And, just as questioning of the wisdom of that decision may start to ease, so too will the debate over goalkeeper Andre Onana.

Andre Onana made a fine stop to deny Ollie Watkins in the first half - one of several key saves by the Manchester United goalkeeper

When United were fighting to keep Onana as long as possible before he eventually reported for Cameroon duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, some were puzzled. Onana's form had been so patchy they wondered why Ten Hag was so reluctant to allow Turkey international Altay Bayindir step in on an extended basis.

At Villa Park, Onana delivered.

""Their keeper was fantastic,"" Villa boss Unai Emery said.

It was an understatement as he produced a string of impressive saves to frustrate the hosts.

Given the number of times he has had to defend the pair, Ten Hag must have been satisfied with their joint contribution.

""The prize is awarded at the end of the season,"" the Dutchman said. ""We are in February and we have many games to play but we are returning. We have to improve our game but we are pleased we have a series of wins.""

Varane-Luiz incident played down

Douglas Luiz celebrated in front of Raphael Varane after scoring Aston Villa's equaliser

Ten Hag played down a spat between United defender Raphael Varane and Douglas Luiz, which appeared to be triggered by the Villa midfielder's reaction when he scored and required the intervention of referee Rob Jones.

""I don't have an opinion about that,"" he said. ""I haven't spoken to the players. I don't think it is important.""

The United boss also said he was not prepared to take a risk with Luke Shaw, who failed to re-appear for the start of the second half.

Shaw was making only his fourth appearance of his latest return from injury after spending three months on the sidelines earlier in the campaign with a muscle problem.

""Luke had some complaints and we know his history,"" Ten Hag said. ""He has had too many injuries and we couldn't take that risk and miss him for six weeks.""","Rasmus Hojlund joined Manchester United from Atalanta for £72m in August 2023Legendary former Manchester United skipper Roy Keane is convinced a top-four finish is in sight, while manager Erik ten Hag has growing belief.

Arsenal scored four goals in the first half of their 6-0 win against West Ham

After beating Premier League leaders Liverpool and creating plenty of debate over their celebrations, it was important Arsenal backed it up with another win on Sunday against West Ham.

They did just that in emphatic fashion.

The ruthless Gunners put six goals without reply past a stunned Hammers that led to many of the home fans departing at half-time, and will no doubt have made their title rivals sit up and take notice.

""This was a massive result,"" former Arsenal forward Paul Merson said on Sky Sports. ""If this was Manchester City we would be waxing lyrical.

""Arsenal don't get the credit they deserve. If you want to win the Premier League you have to bounce back quickly and they have done that.

""They are right in this title race now.""

Former Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown added on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""With the run of games they have, it's fantastic what Arsenal have made happen.

""You would expect them to continue to build on this and the longer this continues, the more the confidence builds.""

'We are in a good moment and have to maintain momentum'

For half an hour at the London Stadium on Sunday there was not really a hint of what was to unfold.

Chances had been few for both sides, with West Ham initially doing a decent job of containing their opponents.

But after William Saliba headed in the opener the Hammers fell apart and Arsenal put them to the sword.

The Gunners scored three goals in six minutes to lead 4-0 at the break and two further quick goals followed in the second half courtesy of Bukayo Saka and ex-West Ham captain Declan Rice.

The win was their joint-biggest margin of victory in an away league match, and their first such win by six goals since December 1935 against Aston Villa, when they won 7-1.

""It's great to make [club] history, especially the way we have done it,"" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.

""We're in a good moment and when you have good moments you have to build and maintain the momentum. The team from the beginning looked really sharp.""

Saka's two goals took him past the 50 mark for Arsenal and on to 13 for the season in all competitions.

""What he has done in the last two or three seasons is remarkable,"" added Arteta.

""His attitude, his quality, what he delivers every week - it's really difficult to find. That's why he is so important to us.""

How do Arsenal compare to the other contenders?

Arsenal beat Premier League leaders Liverpool in a crucial top-of-the-table clash on 4 February

A winter break in Dubai has done wonders for this Arsenal team.

After losing three games in a row in all competitions from 28 December, the Gunners departed for warm weather training in mid-January and have won every game they have played since their return.

But such is the quality of the teams they are up against in the title race, Arteta knows they can ill afford to drop many points between now and the end of the season.

While Arsenal have won their last four games in a row in the Premier League, Manchester City have not dropped any points since 16 December while Liverpool's only league defeat since September was last weekend's loss to the Gunners.

""Manchester City and Liverpool aren't going to drop many points,"" former Arsenal striker Alan Smith said on Sky Sports.

""It feels like every game from here on in is a must win. I don't think that is a bad thing, it keeps them sharp.""

Ex-Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane added: ""If I was in Arsenal's camp, you would be quietly confident you would be right there in the end.

""You can't get carried away. We see teams celebrating, yes do that, but you can't get too carried away.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/68269843,Six Nations 2024: 'Ireland keep back-to-back bid alive but tougher tests await',['Author not found'],"After the pizzazz and fireworks of Marseille, one of Ireland's main priorities going into Sunday's Six Nations encounter with Italy was to avoid the possible hangover from a famous, chest-beating win over one of their fiercest rivals.

In truth, it was never in doubt. While there were a few shaky moments and errors, Ireland produced a professional and efficient performance with six tries to stay on course for another Grand Slam.

While the atmosphere was flat at times, Ireland provided enough moments to spark the Dublin crowd into life, with James Lowe's superb solo score and Jack Crowley's first try for club or country prime examples.

The Azzurri, who caused Ireland plenty of issues in Rome last year, were simply not up to the task.

Ireland know the score now. The rising pressure, the constant questions about Grand Slams, the finish line creeping into sight. They went through it all last year. They know how to navigate the various facets of a Grand Slam bid, and most importantly, they know how to get the job done.

Sunday's performance won't have been revelatory for Ireland's challengers. They remain a remarkably well-coached unit capable of recording comfortable wins even while operating far below their maximum. They also remain the team to beat.

But for Andy Farrell, a 17th successive home win was particularly pleasing given how they completely shut Italy out, the first time Ireland have kept a team scoreless in a championship game since 1987.

""36-0 is a nice scoreline for us,"" said Farrell.

""It's probably a better scoreline than 50-20. I thought we were clinical at times and I thought our set-piece was excellent, top drawer.

""We scored some nice tries on the back of all that type of pressure. Two [wins] from two, it's a decent start but it gets tougher.""

Farrell's last three words reverberate the strongest. While Ireland have beaten France away - arguably their toughest fixture on paper - they must negotiate appointments with their Triple Crown rivals: home games against Wales and Scotland either side of a trip to Twickenham to face England.

While Farrell was able to make six changes and still lead his side past Italy with little fuss, there is a sense that he will need all of his heavy-hitters in the weeks ahead.

With that, the sight of Hugo Keenan limping off in the second half will have been deeply disturbing for Ireland fans. Keenan, one of Ireland's outstanding players in recent years, was electric at full-back again before being forced off.

With captain Peter O'Mahony, Tadhg Furlong and Bundee Aki all carrying niggles that were deemed serious enough for them to be excused from duty for the Italy game, and Garry Ringrose missing the first two matches, the injuries are quietly stacking up in the Irish squad.

Farrell can ill afford further injury headaches before Wales visit Dublin in a fortnight's time even if he does expect the aforementioned trio to return to training this week, but he was not in a position to offer any reassurances about Keenan.

""Hugo has a bang on his knee, so I don't know,"" Farrell said.

""He seems in good spirits but you saw him, he was limping so we'll see how he turns up tomorrow morning, whether he needs anyone to have a look at that I don't know.""

While some of Farrell's frontliners were absent, others stepped up, not least Robbie Henshaw.

A starting centre for the British and Irish Lions in 2021, Henshaw has endured his share of injury troubles while stiff competition in midfield means he is not always assured of a starting spot.

But after a big performance against France last week, the 30-year-old was central to Ireland's success again - even if the smile was momentarily wiped off his face when his second-half try was ruled out.

""He's found his mojo, he's back,"" Farrell said of Henshaw.

""He's on fire at the minute. You could see that when we first met up in training. He's back to his old self.

""His confidence, he's bouncing around the place. We spoke during the week about his combination with Stu [McCloskey] last time they played in Biarritz against Samoa [in a World Cup warm-up] how it wasn't what it should have been.

""They both worked really hard to make the team feel righty today and Robbie was certainly at the heart of that.""

Farrell praised Robbie Henshaw (left) while he said he was unsure about the severity of the knee injury suffered by Hugo Keenan (right)

Doris reflects on 'special' day as captain

It may not have been his best performance, but Sunday will be a day to cherish for Caelan Doris, who became the 110th man to captain Ireland in O'Mahony's absence.

Given that he is only 25 and made his debut for Ireland four years ago - in Farrell's first game in charge, incidentally - it is a telling reflection of Doris' rise that he was a candidate to succeed Johnny Sexton as skipper.

Farrell surprised some by handing the Leinster back row the captaincy - especially with James Ryan in the starting line-up - but Doris delivered a result in his first run-out as the group's leader.

""It was special and knowing the group we have made it even more special,"" said Doris, who admitted he was more nervous than usual in the build-up to the game.

""We're a tight-knit group. We've been together for the guts of four years now, the relationships we have are special.

""The environment the coaches have set, about being ourselves and being vulnerable makes my job easier and made it easier this week. I leaned heavily on the other lads as well.

""I hope everyone that has been involved from Ballina to Blackrock can take a bit of pride from this and seeing me captain the country.""","The Azzurri, who caused Ireland plenty of issues in Rome last year, were simply not up to the task.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68269251,Aston Villa 1-2 Man Utd: Why Villa will still make the Premier League's top four,['Author not found'],"Aston Villa have now lost three home games in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup but I still believe they will finish in the top four - there is no chance that their season will just fizzle out.

Sunday's last-gasp defeat by Manchester United will hurt, of course. It was an especially big blow psychologically, because a draw would have maintained the eight-point gap between the two clubs.

Not only that, it was the second time in the space of a few weeks that Villa have dominated against United for long spells and been beaten. After losing another thrilling game 3-2 at Old Trafford in December, Villa have now seen six points go to a direct rival for a Champions League spot.

It is a setback, but I have been following Villa closely all season after spending time with their squad in the United States during the Premier League Summer Series in July, and I am confident they will respond.

With the organisation I have seen from Unai Emery - his game plan, and the tactical tweaks he makes during games - I still think they will have enough.

Watkins has lost his scoring touch

Watkins was denied by United keeper Andre Onana with all three of his efforts at goal on Sunday

Villa have not suddenly started playing badly, despite some poor results recently. The biggest difference now, compared to the start of the season, is they are not taking their chances in close games.

Up front, Ollie Watkins is going through a bit of a spell where things are not quite falling for him in front of goal, when they were earlier.

Watkins has only scored twice in his past seven Premier League appearances, compared to the nine goals he managed in his first 17 league games of the season.

He is getting the same number of chances per game, but his shot conversion has almost halved and he has gone from over-performing to under-performing with his expected goals.

Ollie Watkins for Aston Villa in the Premier League 2023-24 Up to 21 Dec Per 90 minutes Since 22 Dec 3.02 Total shots 3.00 18% Shot Conversion % 9.5% 9 Goals 2 8.7 xG 2.7 0.4 xG difference -0.7

Behind Watkins, Moussa Diaby's form has dipped too, and he has been involved far less.

He started Villa's first 13 league games of the season but, although he has appeared in all 15 games they have played in all competitions since the start of December, he has come off the bench in eight of them.

They have missed having him at his best, but they are still creating opportunities - as we saw against United, when they had enough chances to win the game.

It is obviously frustrating when you don't take them and lose, but I look at what Villa are doing and think they will come good.

It would be far worse for Emery and his players if they were losing games without having those openings and thinking, 'well, we don't have an identity, or a clear idea of what we are trying to achieve'.

'Adaptable' Villa are hard to keep quiet

When I watched Villa train in the summer, and spoke to Emery, I was extremely impressed with the level of detail in his coaching - and his players' understanding of why they were doing it, and why they were playing in a certain way.

That's why I tipped them to make the top four before the season started, and they have put all of that preparation I witnessed into practice on the pitch.

We've seen over the past six months that there is a clear identity and a pattern to their play, and it was the same against United.

One of the things that stands out for me about Emery is how adaptable he is in his approach, and he showed that again on Sunday.

No matter how United tried to counteract what Villa were doing, they still found ways of getting in behind them. It was just the end product that was missing, and even then it would have been a very different game if not for Andre Onana, who made some great saves.

So, I am certainly not panicking about Villa on the back of that result or performance - there were lots of positives for them to take out of the game.

My concerns are more about whether their squad is deep enough to keep them at the required level to the end of the season.

Do Villa have the depth they need?

Villa have made a total of 32 changes to their starting XI in 24 Premier League games, the fewest in the top flight. Ten of their outfield players have played more than 1,800 minutes in all competitions this season, compared to five from United and three from Tottenham

Given their position at the top end of the table, I was surprised Villa didn't sign more players in January.

They signed four young players but Morgan Rogers, who joined from Middlesbrough, is the only one to go into their first-team squad.

To stay near the top, I always feel you have to keep on improving as a team - but that comes down to the quality of your players. To keep on winning games consistently, you need clinical players, or game-changers.

Diaby was that game-changer for Villa at the beginning of the season but, if his form has dipped, who do they turn to?

Emi Buendia is out with a long-term injury and I don't feel they have the depth they need to carry on their progress. They signed Nicolo Zaniolo on loan from Galatasaray in August, but he has only really done okay in short bursts.

Despite that, I still think Villa's squad are capable of qualifying for the Champions League, especially because fifth place may be enough if England secures an extra spot.

Fewest starting XI changes - Premier League 2023-24 Team & rank Starting XI changes Players used 1. Aston Villa 32 27 2. Crystal Palace 35 26 =3. Everton 37 25 =3. Newcastle 37 30 =5. Tottenham 40 27 *13. Man Utd 52 30

But at the moment it looks like they are in a fight with United and Tottenham for fourth and fifth, and my worry is the amount of European football Villa have already played - and still could play - in the Europa Conference League will catch up with them.

Villa have used 27 players in the Premier League this season, which is about average and similar to United and Spurs, but their outfield players have played more minutes in all competitions and been rotated less - the least in the Premier League in fact.

Outfield players to have played more than 1,800 minutes in 2023-24 Aston Villa (10) John McGinn (2,884), Ezri Konsa (2,823), Douglas Luiz (2,759), Ollie Watkins (2,711), Boubacar Kamara (2,410), Matty Cash (2,239), Moussa Diaby (2,055), Lucas Digne (2,022), Pau Torres (1,831), Leon Bailey (1,810) Man Utd (5) Bruno Fernandes (2,815), Diogo Dalot (2,683), Rasmus Hojlund (2,096), Alejandro Garnacho (2,057), Marcus Rashford (2,055) Tottenham (3) Pedro Porro (2,247), Dejan Kulusevski (2,049), Destiny Udogie (1,948)

United and Spurs do not have European football to worry about in the run-in either, and it already feels like they have both been getting stronger in the past few weeks as their players have returned from injury, or international duty.

That's not been the case for Villa, who have already lost key defender Ezri Konsa to injury this month and saw Boubacar Kamara forced off with a knee problem against United.

It all makes their task even harder but they have put themselves in a great position and, with Emery's know-how and guidance, I believe they can push on.

Stephen Warnock was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","The biggest difference now, compared to the start of the season, is they are not taking their chances in close games.
Watkins has only scored twice in his past seven Premier League appearances, compared to the nine goals he managed in his first 17 league games of the season.
No matter how United tried to counteract what Villa were doing, they still found ways of getting in behind them.
Villa have made a total of 32 changes to their starting XI in 24 Premier League games, the fewest in the top flight.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68269657,West Ham 0-6 Arsenal: 'Disgraceful' West Ham need David Moyes 'clarity',['Author not found'],"There were plenty of empty seats at the London Stadium with West Ham 6-0 down

The sight of West Ham fans streaming out of the London Stadium before half-time said it all.

With Arsenal having propelled themselves into a 4-0 lead by half-time, a significant number of Hammers supporters had seen enough.

Those who did remain to the bitter end failed to see a positive reaction, with Arsenal scoring two more second-half goals to secure their biggest Premier League away victory and West Ham's biggest home defeat since 1963.

The result will increase the pressure on manager David Moyes, whose future is uncertain as he enters the final five months of his contract.

The scenes at full-time were in sharp contrast to those in Prague last June, when West Ham beat Fiorentina to win the Europa Conference League - the club's first major trophy in 43 years.

""To be a football supporter and especially at this club - I came back twice to keep them out of relegation - there's always going to be bad times,"" said Moyes.

""It was only a few months ago we were having probably the best time West Ham have ever had. I'll take a bit of time and see if I can fix it.

""I totally understand them [the fans] leaving but at football clubs you're going to have bad days. I certainly wouldn't forget the good ones.""

'We didn't look like we could defend today'

Moyes was first appointed West Ham boss in November 2017 but left at the end of the season when his contract was not renewed, only to return for his second spell in December 2019.

He has since led West Ham to two top-seven finishes in the Premier League and that Europa Conference League triumph last year.

They beat Arsenal 2-0 at the Emirates in December to end 2023 in sixth place in the Premier League, but are winless in seven games in all competitions since, including an FA Cup third-round replay defeat by Championship side Bristol City.

""I'm not used to my team conceding the goals like we have been,"" Moyes told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""We have no real reason to say why that should be happening. For some reason we didn't look like we could defend today.""

Former West Ham striker Tony Cottee blamed the club's board for the continuing uncertainty over Moyes' contract, as well as a quiet transfer window that only saw Kalvin Phillips come into the club on loan from Manchester City.

""Absolute shambles. Club will never change with this board,"" Cottee wrote on X. external-link ""No investment in the window and a manager with five months left on his contract. Players, tactics and the result were poor today. Where do we go from here? I don't know.""

Former Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown believes the uncertainty over Moyes' future is undermining the club's season.

""Six weeks ago we said 'give him a new contract and sort it out'. You can't always please every supporter,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""They haven't done that and after a day like today, they've left it open. We haven't seen any clarity.

""The fans pay their money and are entitled to do what they want, some of them and enough of them are making their voices heard.""

'Moyes is under huge pressure'

Simon Stone, BBC Sport

In the early weeks of his second stint at the London Stadium, West Ham went eight games without a win. The run was ended by a victory against Southampton that was preceded by a massive demonstration against the club's owners. West Ham subsequently lost their next three games, either side of the Covid-19 shutdown, before scrambling their way to safety.

David Moyes often refers to this as evidence of the progress his side has made in the years since.

Two top-seven finishes, a Europa League semi-final and, memorably, a Europa Conference League triumph in Prague last June will ensure Moyes' legacy will be a positive one, no matter what is happening in the here and now.

Speaking after the 6-0 home loss to Arsenal, Moyes did not sound like a man who was concerned about getting the sack. After all, talks over a new contract seemed to be progressing towards a positive conclusion and it is less than two months since West Ham were beating Manchester United at home and Arsenal away either side of Christmas.

But heavy defeats in the reverse fixtures, following on from an FA Cup elimination at Championship outfit Bristol City, with other big losses at Fulham and Liverpool fresh in the mind, certainly mean Moyes is under huge pressure.

The promise of this season has in the short-term given way to a slide into mid-table. Before the international break, West Ham have winnable fixtures against Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton, Burnley and Aston Villa. They also have a Europa League last-16 game against, as yet, unknown opponents.

With criticism of perceived negative tactics a familiar theme this season, Moyes needs to deliver victories, not the tepid draws at Sheffield United and Bournemouth, which immediately preceded the last two defeats.

Moyes has done so much to change West Ham's fortunes in the past four years. But patience is finite.","There were plenty of empty seats at the London Stadium with West Ham 6-0 downThe sight of West Ham fans streaming out of the London Stadium before half-time said it all.
