South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae myung

The leader of South Korea's political opposition was stabbed at a news conference in the southern port city of Busan, Yonhap news agency reports.

Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the presidential elections in 2022, was stabbed on the left side of his neck on Tuesday morning.

The male attacker was arrested at the scene.

Mr Lee sustained a 1cm laceration on his neck and was treated in the hospital while conscious, Yonhap said.

The attacker who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, reportedly approached Mr Lee asking for an autograph, before suddenly lunging forward to stab him.

Videos of the attack on social media show Mr Lee first collapsing into the crowd and then onto the ground, while several people try to restrain the attacker. Photographs after the incident show Mr Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed as someone presses a handkerchief to the side of his neck.

Yonhap said he was airlifted to hospital in a helicopter.

Mr Lee, 59, leads the Democratic Party of Korea. He is not currently a member of South Korea's legislature but is widely expected to run for a seat in the next general election, which will take place in April 2024.

He narrowly lost the 2022 presidential elections - by a mere 0.73% difference in votes - to current President Yoon Suk-yeol, making it the closest presidential race in South Korean history. He is widely expected to stand in the next presidential elections in 2027.

Since then he has been indicted on corruption and breach of trust charges, with prosecutors accusing him of allowing private developers to profit illegally from a property project while he was mayor of Seongnam, a city of 1 million people to the south of Seoul. Mr Lee has denied those charges, calling them politically motivated.

In September a court dismissed a request from the prosecution for him to be held in custody while he awaited trial on the charges. Prosecutors are still investigating him on a number of other cases linked to corruption while he was in office.","Lee Jae-myung: South Korea opposition leader stabbed in Busan.

A protester outside the Supreme Court in September last year

Israel's Supreme Court has struck down a controversial judicial reform that triggered nationwide protests last year against the Netanyahu government.

The change would have limited the power of the Supreme Court in overturning laws it deemed unconstitutional.

Critics say it would have severely undermined the country's democracy by weakening the judicial system.

There is strong opposition to the current Netanyahu government, seen as the most right-wing in Israeli history.

The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the law passed by the government in 2023 follows months of internal turmoil.

In July, the government passed into law what is now known as the ""reasonableness"" bill.

This removed the power of the Supreme Court and lower courts in Israel to cancel government decisions it deemed to be ""extremely unreasonable"".

The law caused widespread anger and division, prompting hundreds of thousands of protesters to take the streets calling for the reforms to be scrapped - and for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Organisers said the weekly protests were the biggest street demonstrations in Israel's history.

At the time, hundreds of military reservists - including air force pilots - threatened to refuse to report for service, which led to warnings that this could impair Israel's military capabilities.

A statement from the Supreme Court said that 8 out of 15 judges ruled against the law, adding it would have caused ""severe and unprecedented damage to the basic characteristics of the State of Israel as a democratic state"".

Israel's justice minister and architect of the law Yariv Levin criticised the judges for ""taking into their hands all the powers"" and called their decision to strike it down undemocratic.

But opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the verdict, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the country's top court had ""faithfully fulfilled its role in protecting the citizens of Israel"".

One of the organisers involved in last year's large-scale protests against the law also welcomed the court's ruling.

Shikma Bressler said in a video statement that the Supreme Court had for the moment removed ""the sword of dictatorship from around our necks"".

The ""reasonableness"" law was part of a wider series of judicial reforms introduced by the Netanyahu government.

These would have weakened the power of the Supreme Court to review or throw out laws, enabling a simple majority of one in the Knesset (parliament) to overrule such decisions.

The government has also attempted to gain greater power over appointing judges, and to scrap the requirement for ministers to obey the advice of their legal advisers.

Mr Netanyahu has argued that the changes are required to redress the balance between the judges and the politicians.

The Supreme Court's ruling threatens to further undermine confidence in his government. Mr Netanyahu's Likud party said the decision opposed ""the will of the people for unity, especially during wartime"".","Israel Supreme Court strikes down judicial reformsBy Shaimaa Khalil in Jerusalem & Ali Abbas Ahmadi in London BBC NewsGetty ImagesA protester outside the Supreme Court in September last yearIsrael's Supreme Court has struck down a controversial judicial reform that triggered nationwide protests last year against the Netanyahu government.

Reuters

Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike in Ukraine in response to a Ukrainian attack on the city of Belgorod

President Vladimir Putin has pledged to ""intensify"" attacks against Ukraine, following days of aerial bombardment by both sides in the long-running war.

Speaking during a visit to a military hospital in Moscow, Mr Putin said the military would continue targeting Ukrainian ""military installations"".

He called an air raid on the Russian city of Belgorod by Ukraine a ""deliberate strike against civilians"".

Twenty-five people were killed in Saturday's attack, local officials say.

Speaking to Russian servicemen on Monday, Mr Putin said the war was turning in Moscow's favour and he wanted the war to end quickly, but only on Russia's terms.

He added that Ukraine's Western supporters were the biggest obstacle to ending the conflict, but said their rhetoric was beginning to change as they started to realise they could not ""destroy"" Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky countered these claims in an interview with The Economist, saying Mr Putin's suggestion that Russia was winning the war was only a ""feeling"".

He highlighted Russia's casualty figures in Ukraine, and said the opposing forces had been unable to take a single large city in 2023.

Mr Zelensky also expressed frustration with Kyiv's Western allies, saying they had lost a sense of urgency.

The two leaders earlier delivered new year messages.

On Sunday, Mr Putin hailed Russian soldiers as ""heroes"" without explicitly referring to the war in Ukraine.

In his own address to mark the start of 2024, Mr Zelensky promised a sharp increase in the number of weapons produced by the country - pledging to build at least a million drones.

Russia says a Ukrainian attack on the city of Belgorod damaged buildings including a shopping centre

Russia and Ukraine have exchanged deadly attacks over the past few days.

Ukraine shelled the Russia-held Ukrainian cities of Donetsk on New Year's Eve, according Moscow-installed officials, which killed at least four people and wounded 13.

And on Saturday, Ukrainian forces launched a series of strikes on targets in south-west Russia, including the strike on Belgorod which Mr Putin termed a ""terrorist attack"".

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Monday that the death toll had risen to 25 following the death of a young child who was seriously injured in the attack.

""Today, a 4-year-old girl died in a regional children's hospital. She was in a highly serious condition with combined injuries to the chest and internal organs,"" Mr Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The girl's death brought the number of child victims of the attack to five, the governor said. He added that 109 people were wounded in the air raid, with 45 currently in hospital.","Putin vows to 'intensify' attacks against Ukraine military targetsBy Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC NewsReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike in Ukraine in response to a Ukrainian attack on the city of BelgorodPresident Vladimir Putin has pledged to ""intensify"" attacks against Ukraine, following days of aerial bombardment by both sides in the long-running war.

By Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Addis Ababa

Reuters

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (L) signed the memorandum of understanding with Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi in Addis Ababa

Ethiopia has taken the first legal steps on a path that could one day enable the landlocked country to gain access to the sea, its government says.

It has signed what is known as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the self-declared republic of Somaliland to use one of its ports.

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has previously described sea access as an existential issue for his country.

His statement in October prompted tensions across the Horn of Africa.

There were some fears, quickly dampened by the authorities, that this implied trying to take land from another of Ethiopia's neighbours, Eritrea.

The details of Monday's agreement with Somaliland have not been made public but a statement from Mr Abiy's office said it would ""pave the way to realise the aspiration of Ethiopia to secure access to the sea"". Talks leading up to the MoU have focused on the Somaliland port of Berbera.

Mr Abiy's national security adviser, Redwan Hussien, also said on X that the arrangement could also enable Ethiopia to access a ""leased military base"" on the sea.

An MoU is not legally binding but can lead to a treaty imposing obligations on those parties who have signed.

Nevertheless, the development is being portrayed by Addis Ababa as a major diplomatic victory.

The prime minister, who signed the MoU with Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi in the Ethiopian capital, wrote on X that ""all that can be said is thank God"".

Speaking at the signing, President Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent country at some point in the future.

Somaliland seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but is not recognised by the African Union (AU) or the UN as an independent state.

There has been no response regarding the announcement from Somalia, which considers Somaliland as part of its territory. But national broadcaster SNTV reports that there will be an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Ethiopia lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. With more than 100 million people, it is the most populous landlocked country in the world.

Up to now Ethiopia has been using the port in neighbouring Djibouti for the vast majority of its imports and exports.

In 2018 Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a deal that should have led to Addis Ababa owning a 19% stake of the port of Berbera, with the Emirati logistics company DP World holding a 51% share.","Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has previously described sea access as an existential issue for his country.

Jeremy Renner: ""I'm just so blessed I had so many things to live for""

Marvel films actor Jeremy Renner said knowing he has ""a lot to fight for"" helped him survive the aftermath of a snow plough accident a year ago.

Renner, 52, was in critical condition after breaking more than 30 bones after being accidentally run over by his own snow plough, on New Year's Day 2022.

He told CNN: ""I'm just so blessed I had so many things to live for, I have a giant family, a 10-year-old daughter.""

The only option he gave himself was to ""get better"".

""I would have disappointed and really messed up a lot of people's lives if I would have passed,"" said the actor, who plays Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

""I'm also pretty stubborn, there's a lot for me to fight for and recovery was just a one-way road in my mind and my recovery.""

Renner/Instagram

The police accident report said Renner tried to enter the snow plough's cab to stop the vehicle moving

The accident happened after a new year storm hit the US, dumping heavy snowfall across several states.

Renner used his snow plough to rescue his nephew who was driving a car, but had got stuck in the snow near his house.

He successfully towed the car free, but when he got out, the plough began to move while unattended, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said at the time.

Renner was trying to get back into the driver's seat to stop it moving, when the ""extremely large"" piece of equipment ran him over, Mr Balaam added.

The actor was airlifted to hospital in Reno, Nevada, and spent some time in an intensive care unit.

He told CNN about the trauma for his ""poor nephew"" who saw him being run over, saying: ""I gave him you know, images that he can never unsee"".

But he added: ""I know that my healing would be healing for him"", as well as others close to him affected by the accident, such as his daughter.

He said he had ""never thought about my own physical ailments or my own pain or my own anguish - so the one-way road to recovery was like a mental attitude.

""And that attitude was always to get better. And there's no option other than that.""

On his Instagram stories, Renner shared an image of him hugging his nephew after speaking to CNN, and wrote: ""Post-interview love from my sweet nephew who helped save my life.""

Renner also recently returned to the hospital that treated him to thank the staff.

""Stopped by to see kids/superheroes, first responders and doctors, nurses and staff at Renown hospital,"" he posted on social media.

""Paying my respects and celebrating love, life and the blessings it brings to us all. Thank you and this community for keeping me here. I'm forever in your debt with gratitude"".

The actor is probably best-known for his role in the Marvel films, but he also starred in 2008 film The Hurt Locker - for which he received a best actor Oscar nomination - as well as Wind River, American Hustle and Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol.

Renner was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for his role in 2010 film The Town.

He also stars in Paramount+ series The Mayor Of Kingstown and told CNN he now felt ready to return to filming for the third season.","Jeremy Renner: Marvel star 'has a lot to fight for' a year after snow plough accidentBy Helen Bushby Culture reporterGetty ImagesJeremy Renner: ""I'm just so blessed I had so many things to live for""Marvel films actor Jeremy Renner said knowing he has ""a lot to fight for"" helped him survive the aftermath of a snow plough accident a year ago.

By Anbarasan Ethirajan BBC News

A court in Bangladesh has sentenced the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to six months in jail for violating the country's labour laws.

Prof Yunus' supporters say the case is politically motivated.

The acclaimed economist and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom - one of the firms he founded - were found guilty of failing to create a welfare fund for their workers.

All four deny any wrongdoing and have been granted bail pending appeals.

""As my lawyers have convincingly argued in court, this verdict against me is contrary to all legal precedent and logic,"" Prof Yunus said in a statement released after the verdict.

""I call for the Bangladeshi people to speak in one voice against injustice and in favour of democracy and human rights for each and every one of our citizens.""

The 83-year-old Yunus, known internationally as the ""banker to the poor"", is credited with establishing a pioneering system of micro-finance loans helping to lift millions out of poverty.

Prof Yunus and his Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in 2006.

Discussing the verdict, one of his lawyers, Abdullah Al Mamun, told the BBC: ""It was an unprecedent judgement. No due legal process was followed in the case and it was rushed through.""

Mr Mamun added: ""The whole idea is to damage his international reputation. We are appealing against this verdict.""

Prof Yunus's lawyers say he is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged graft.

Prime Minister Hasina Sheikh once described Prof Yunus as a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor and accused Grameen Bank of charging exorbitant interest rates.

Irene Khan - the former head of rights organisation Amnesty International who works as a UN special rapporteur - was present at Monday's verdict. She told the AFP news agency the conviction was ""a travesty of justice"".

In August, more than 170 global figures called on Ms Hasina to stop the ""persecution"" of Prof Yunus.

The letter, whose signatories included former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and U2 lead singer Bono, asked that the ""continuous judicial harassment"" of Prof Yunus be stopped.

Ms Hasina said she welcomed international experts to assess the ongoing legal proceedings against Prof Yunus.","Muhammad Yunus: Nobel laureate sentenced to jail in BangladeshBy Anbarasan Ethirajan BBC NewsEPAA court in Bangladesh has sentenced the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to six months in jail for violating the country's labour laws.

By Hannah Ritchie BBC News, Sydney

Desree Pether

An Australian man whose family argue he is being ""held hostage"" in Iraq has now spent 1,000 days in prison.

Robert Pether was jailed in 2021 on fraud charges, but the UN has described it as an arbitrary detention.

After three Christmases behind bars, his family says Mr Pether has hit ""rock bottom"" and that his health is rapidly deteriorating.

His lawyer is calling on the Australian government to urgently secure the father of three's release.

Desree Pether worries that her husband - who has lost a third of his body weight since being arrested - may die in prison and never see his children Flynn 20, Oscar 18, and Nala 11, again.

""There's no light at the end of the tunnel and so many moments have been stolen from us,"" she told the BBC.

""Nala wrote to Santa this year asking if he could stop by Iraq and pick up her dad up on the way through - I said that Santa can't get involved in political matters.""

A mechanical engineer, Mr Pether had gone to Iraq to rebuild its Central Bank headquarters in Baghdad.

But a contract dispute between the bank and his employer - CME Consulting - landed Mr Pether and his Egyptian colleague Khalid Radwan in prison, after the bank accused the men of stealing money from the project.

After behind held without charge for almost six months, and then subjected to a speedy trial, the two were each given a five-year jail sentence and slapped with a joint fine of $12m (A$17.5m, £9.4m).

However, a 2022 report from the UN determined that the case contravened international law and that Mr Pether and Mr Khalid had been subjected to ""abusive and coercive"" interrogations.

Iraq's government has previously denied allegations of ill treatment, but the matter is now under investigation by the UN's Special Rapporteur on torture.

And earlier this year, the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) Court of Arbitration ruled that Iraq's central bank was at fault in the dispute with CME and ordered it to pay $13m to the company.

UK human rights lawyer Peter Griffin, who is representing Mr Pether, says the ICC finding ""completely undercuts Iraq's argument that Robert's imprisonment is justified"" by the ""supposed wrongdoings"" of the company he worked for.

""That is now totally disproven and cannot provide the basis for his incarceration,"" he told the BBC.

Mr Griffin believes that Iraq is holding Mr Pether ""in the hope that it can parlay his release into some sort of financial gain"" and says that the Australian government needs to ""up its game"".

""We have all seen the great lengths that some countries will go to secure the release of their nationals in similar situations... if Robert was from the US or UK, he would have been home long ago.""","Robert Pether: Australian jailed in Iraq reaches 1,000-day milestoneBy Hannah Ritchie BBC News, SydneyDesree PetherAn Australian man whose family argue he is being ""held hostage"" in Iraq has now spent 1,000 days in prison.

More than 21,800 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women

The Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024.

In a new year's message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said troop deployments were being adjusted to prepare for ""prolonged fighting"".

Daniel Hagari said some troops - especially reservists - would be withdrawn to allow them to regroup.

""These adaptations are intended to ensure the planning and preparation for continuing the war in 2024,"" he said.

""The IDF must plan ahead out of an understanding that there will be additional missions and the fighting will continue the rest of the year.""

He said that some reservists would leave Gaza ""as soon as this week"" to allow them to ""re-energise ahead of the coming operations"".

Some 21,978 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Its latest update said 56,697 people in Gaza had been wounded over the same period.

The figures included 156 people killed and 246 injured in the last 24 hours, the ministry added.

The latest war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza up until the end of what has been a dark year in the region.

The IDF said it killed a senior Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attack, Adil Mismah, in an overnight strike on the town of Deir al-Balah.

The Gaza health ministry reported at least 48 deaths in overnight bombing in Gaza City. Witnesses told the AFP news agency that another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the city's west.

Another strike on Monday morning was said to have killed at least 10 people in the al-Maghazi refugee camp.

The BBC has not been able to verify the latest battlefield reports.

A resident of northern Gaza displaced to the south of the enclave highlighted the contrast between New Year celebrations around the world and the situation in Gaza.

""Tonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air,"" Zainab Khalil, 57, told Reuters on Sunday.

""In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians.""

The UN says 85% of Gaza's 2.4 million people - almost two million - have now been displaced.

Thousands of doses of vaccines against childhood diseases, including polio and measles, have been delivered to Gaza, to help tackle a growing health emergency, Reuters reports.

The news agency quoted the Palestinian health ministry as saying that supplies estimated to cover vaccinations for up to 14 months had entered through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Speaking from Rafah, Ayadil Saparbekov from the World Health Organization told the BBC that vaccines were crucial because of the conditions in which Gazans were living.

""Thousands of people live together in overcrowded camps with very poor water conditions, poor hygiene and very poor sanitation - these are all breeding grounds for various diseases,"" he said.

Watch: Young Gazans hope for peace in new year

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that ""the war is at its height"".

""We are fighting on all of the fronts,"" he said. ""We have huge success but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time.

""As the (army) chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months.""

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"".

The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.

Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and southern Israel as it saw in the new year, with Israeli missile defence systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, AFP reported.

One man who was in Tel Aviv celebrating the new year with friends said: ""I was terrified, like it was the first time I saw missiles. It's terrifying.""

Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video posted on social media that it carried out both attacks.","Israel says war in Gaza expected to continue throughout 2024By George Wright BBC NewsGetty ImagesMore than 21,800 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and womenThe Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024.

The latest war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza up until the end of what has been a dark year in the region.

The IDF said it killed a senior Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attack, Adil Mismah, in an overnight strike on the town of Deir al-Balah.

The Gaza health ministry reported at least 48 deaths in overnight bombing in Gaza City. Witnesses told the AFP news agency that another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the city's west.

Another strike on Monday morning was said to have killed at least 10 people in the al-Maghazi refugee camp.

The BBC has not been able to verify the latest battlefield reports.

A resident of northern Gaza displaced to the south of the enclave highlighted the contrast between New Year celebrations around the world and the situation in Gaza.

""Tonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air,"" Zainab Khalil, 57, told Reuters on Sunday.

""In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians.""

The UN says 85% of Gaza's 2.4 million people - almost two million - have now been displaced.

Thousands of doses of vaccines against childhood diseases, including polio and measles, have been delivered to Gaza, to help tackle a growing health emergency, Reuters reports.

The news agency quoted the Palestinian health ministry as saying that supplies estimated to cover vaccinations for up to 14 months had entered through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Speaking from Rafah, Ayadil Saparbekov from the World Health Organization told the BBC that vaccines were crucial because of the conditions in which Gazans were living.

""Thousands of people live together in overcrowded camps with very poor water conditions, poor hygiene and very poor sanitation - these are all breeding grounds for various diseases,"" he said.

Watch: Young Gazans hope for peace in new year

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that ""the war is at its height"".

""We are fighting on all of the fronts,"" he said. ""We have huge success but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time.

""As the (army) chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months.""

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"".

The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.

Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and southern Israel as it saw in the new year, with Israeli missile defence systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, AFP reported.

One man who was in Tel Aviv celebrating the new year with friends said: ""I was terrified, like it was the first time I saw missiles. It's terrifying.""

Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video posted on social media that it carried out both attacks.","Israel says war in Gaza expected to continue throughout 2024By George Wright BBC NewsGetty ImagesMore than 21,800 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and womenThe Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024.

Ana Ofelia Murguía, the Mexican actress who voiced great-grandmother Mama Coco in the Oscar-winning Disney Pixar animation Coco, has died aged 90.

She had a key part in the film about a Mexican boy who crosses to the Land of the Dead, uncovering family secrets while trying to become a musician.

The movie highlights the Day of the Dead and celebrates Mexico's culture.

Its National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature said her career was ""vital for the performing arts of Mexico"".

One of Coco's most memorable moments was the scene where Mama Coco and her great-grandson Miguel sing Remember Me together.

He sings: ""For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart,"" and she joins in to sing: ""Until you're in my arms again... Remember me.""

The film is set during the Day of the Dead festival held each year in South American countries, including Mexico, celebrating the cycle of life and death.

Big parades are held and people often paint their faces to look like skulls, remembering friends and family who have died and passed into the afterlife.

""With deep sadness we regret the sensitive death of the leading actress Ana Ofelia Murguía, who was part of the stable cast of the National Theater Company of Mexico, and whose artistic career was vital for the performing arts of Mexico,"" the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature added.

Born in Mexico in 1933, Murguía won a special lifetime achievement Golden Ariel award in 2011 at a ceremony recognising the best of the Mexican cinema industry.

She shared the prize, for her career spanning more than 40 years in stage, film and television, with director and writer Jorge Fons.

She also won best supporting actress at the Ariel awards in 1979, 1986 and 1996 for films including 1994's La Reina de la Noche (The Queen of the Night), about a female cabaret artist who remakes her career in Mexico after leaving Berlin following an incident with the Nazis.

Celebrating Coco's double Oscar win in 2018 for best animated film and best original song, one of its producers, Lee Unkrich, said his biggest thanks went to Mexico and that the film could not have existed without its ""endlessly beautiful culture and traditions"".

Warner was Australia's leading run scorer in November's Cricket World Cup

Australia batter David Warner has announced his retirement from one-day international (ODI) cricket in the lead-up to his final Test match.

The 37-year-old previously announced his retirement from Test cricket before an ongoing series with Pakistan.

On Monday, Warner said his decision to also retire from ODI cricket was one he was ""very, very comfortable with"".

He played a pivotal role in helping Australia win the Cricket World Cup against India last year.

Warner, who was Australia's leading run scorer at the tournament, said he felt the time was right after an ""absolutely amazing"" World Cup.

He also said retiring would create opportunities for new players and allow him greater freedom to play franchise cricket overseas - Warner has been a part of the Indian Premier League for 14 seasons, and has a massive following.

But he did not rule out playing in the 2025 Champions Trophy if called upon.

Warner will play his 112th and final Test in his home city of Sydney on Wednesday.

He has played 161 ODI matches, scoring 6,932 runs to be the sixth-highest run scorer in Australian ODI history.

However, his career has not been without controversy.

In 2018, Warner - who was then Australia vice-captain - was banned from playing all forms of international cricket for a year over his involvement in the sandpapergate ball-tampering scandal. He has also been permanently banned from holding a leadership position in Australian cricket teams.

Cricket Australia - the sport's governing body in the country - said Warner had devised a plan to artificially alter the state of the ball with sandpaper during a match with South Africa, and then instructed a junior player to carry it out. On Monday, he told Australian media he had no regrets over his actions.

This, along with other incidents such as an altercation in a bar with England cricketer Joe Root, have made him a divisive figure on the cricketing stage.

He is unpopular with many England cricket supporters, while fans in Australia have also expressed their disappointment over the ball-tampering issue. Most recently, former Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson questioned why Warner should get a ""hero's send-off"" in his last Test series.

""It's been five years and David Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal,"" he wrote in an Australian newspaper.

However, Warner's contribution to the game is undeniable.

He is widely popular in India - not only for his skill on the field, but also for some timely social media content, such as posts in which he breaks out dance moves from popular south Indian films.

Warner himself said he was feeling ""great"" in Monday's news conference.","Australia veteran David Warner retires from ODI cricketBy Ayeshea Perera BBC NewsGetty ImagesWarner was Australia's leading run scorer in November's Cricket World CupAustralia batter David Warner has announced his retirement from one-day international (ODI) cricket in the lead-up to his final Test match.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was launched to orbit just two years ago, but already it's starting to redefine our view of the early Universe.

CASSIOPEIA A The expanding shells of debris from Cas A, an exploded star, or supernova. The main ring is about 15 light-years across.

JUPITER The largest planet in the Solar System, Jupiter, viewed in infrared light. The brightest features are at the highest altitudes – the tops of convective storm clouds.

Without really stretching its capabilities, the infrared observatory has been peering deep into the cosmos to show us galaxies of stars as they were up to 13.5 billion years ago.

A lot of them are brighter, more massive, and more mature than many scientists thought possible so soon after the Big Bang, which occurred 13.8 billion years ago.

""We certainly thought we'd be seeing fuzzy blobs of stars. But we're also seeing fully formed galaxies with perfect spiral arms,"" said Prof Gillian Wright.

""Theorists are already working on how you get those mature structures so early in the Universe. In that sense, Webb is really changing scientific thinking,"" the director of the UK Astronomy Technology Centre told BBC News.

M51 The Whirlpool Galaxy can be seen in the night sky with just binoculars. Here, the most powerful space telescope ever launched uses its incredible capabilities to study the intricate spiral arms.

CHAMELEON I The Chameleon I molecular cloud is about 630 light-years from Earth. It's here, at temperatures down to about -260C, that Webb has detected types of ice grains not previously observed.

SAGITTARIUS C Webb looks to the centre of our galaxy, close to where a supermassive black hole exists. This region of space contains tens of thousands of stars, including many that are birthing inside the bright pink feature at centre-left. The cyan colour highlights excited hydrogen gas.

And it's not just the efficiency with which these early galaxies were able to form their stars that's been a surprise, the size of their central black holes has been a marvel, too.

There's a monster at the core of our Milky Way that's four billion times the mass of our Sun. One theory suggests such behemoths are made over time by accreting lots of smaller holes produced as remnants from exploded stars, or supernovae.

""But the preliminary evidence from JWST is that some of these early giants may have completely bypassed the star stage,"" said Dr Adam Carnall from the University of Edinburgh.

""There is a scenario where huge clouds of gas in the early Universe could have collapsed violently and just kept going, straight to being black holes.""

NGC 3256 This is what you get when two galaxies crash into each other, an event estimated to have occurred about 500 million years ago. The collision drives the formation of new stars that then illuminate the gas and dust around them.

CRAB NEBULA The famous supernova remnant first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. It’s located some 6,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus.

When James Webb was launched at Christmas 2021, it was thought it might have 10 years of operations ahead of it. The telescope needs its own fuel to maintain station 1.5 million km from Earth. But the flight to orbit on an Ariane rocket was so accurate, it's estimated now to have fuel reserves for 20 years of life, if not longer.

This means, rather than racing through their observations, astronomers can afford take a more strategic approach to the telescope's work.

""We thought we'd be skimming cream; we no longer need to do that,"" said Dr Eric Smith, Webb's programme scientist at the US space agency Nasa.

One activity that's sure to accelerate is the practice of making ""deep fields"". These are long stares at particular patches of sky that will allow the telescope to trace the light from the faintest and most distant galaxies. It's how Webb is likely to spot the very first galaxies and possibly even some of the very first stars to shine in the Universe.

SATURN The famed ringed planet appears quite dark to Webb in this image because methane in the planet absorbs infrared light strongly. Three of Saturn’s moon are seen to the left.

HH212 A baby star, no more than 50,000 years old, launches energetic jets from both poles that light up the molecular hydrogen in pink. The entire structure is 1.6 light-years across.

The Hubble telescope famously expended many days just looking at a single corner of the cosmos. ""I don't think we'll need the hundreds of hours of exposure that Hubble used, but I do think we'll need multiple deep fields,"" said Dr Emma Curtis-Lake from the University of Hertfordshire.

""We've already had some quite long exposures with JWST and we're seeing quite a lot of variation. So, we can't put everything into one teeny-tiny area because there's no guarantee we'll find something super-exciting.""

JADES The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, otherwise known as Jades, has the earliest confirmed galaxy, called JADES-GS-z13-0, which is observed at just 325 million years after the Big Bang.

STAR CLUSTER IC 348 Wispy filaments of gas and dust stream between a cluster of bright stars. Webb found the lowest mass brown dwarf, or “failed star”, in this image – an object about three to four times the mass of our Jupiter.

The Space Telescope Science Institute's Dr Massimo Stiavelli dreams of spotting a star that is primordial - that has the signature of the original chemistry that emerged from the Big Bang; that hasn't been polluted with elements that were forged only later in cosmic history.

""We'll need to see them as supernovae, when they explode,"" the head of the Webb mission office said.

""To achieve this, we need to start looking at the same patches year after year to catch them before and just after they go off. They'll be extremely rare and we'll need to be very lucky.""

EARENDEL The most distant single star observed to date is called Earendel. James Webb confirmed its light has taken 12.9 billion years to reach us. Its light has been boosted by the gravity of foreground galaxies.

ORION NEBULA The famous star forming region can just about be seen by the naked eye as a smudge on the sky. It would take a spaceship travelling at light-speed a little over four years to traverse this Webb scene.

Marvel at the extraordinary collection of James Webb pictures on this page - from the most distant reaches of the Universe to the nearby familiar objects in our own Solar System.

It's amazing to think that imaging isn't actually the telescope's majority workload.

More than 70% of its time is spent doing spectroscopy. That's sampling the light from objects and slicing it up into its ""rainbow"" colours. It's how you retrieve key information about the chemistry, temperature, density and velocity of the targets under study.

""You could think of Webb as a giant spectrograph that takes the occasional nice picture,"" joked Dr Smith.

Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Princess Mary in 2018

Danes were given a surprise on New Year's Eve as Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication.

The world's only reigning queen and the longest-serving living monarch in Europe will step down on 14 January, which will be 52 years to the day since she became queen.

""I will leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik,"" she announced live on TV.

But what do we know about Denmark's soon-to-be king?

Crown Prince Frederik was known in Denmark as somewhat of a party prince in the early 1990s, but perceptions started to change after he graduated from Aarhus University in 1995 with a masters in political science. He was the first Danish royal to complete a university education.

During his studies he spent time at Harvard in the United States, where he enrolled under the pseudonym Frederik Henriksen.

He later served in the Danish navy, where he was nicknamed ""Pingo"" - which according to the Mail was earned after his wetsuit filled up with water during a scuba diving course and he had to waddle like a penguin.

The 55-year-old has earned his name as a daredevil, taking part in a four-month ski expedition across Greenland in 2000. He has been hospitalised in sledging and scooter accidents.

""I don't want to lock myself in a fortress. I want to be myself, a human being,"" he once said, insisting he would stick to that even after taking the throne.

Crown Prince Frederik took part in a 3,500 km journey across Greenland in 2000

Crown Prince Frederik, like Britain's King Charles III, is known for his passion for the environment. He has vowed to ""guide the ship"" of Denmark into the future.

His Australian-born wife, Princess Mary, grew up on the island of Tasmania and was working as a lawyer when the pair met in 2000, at a bar in Sydney during the Olympic Games.

She once said in an interview that she did not know he was the prince of Denmark when they met, saying: ""Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'""

They are considered by some to represent modern values and have tried to give their four children - a daughter, son and twins - as normal an upbringing as possible, sending them mainly to state schools.

Unlike British royal tradition, there will be no formal crowning ceremony for Crown Prince Frederik. Instead, his accession will be announced from Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen on the day.

He will become King of Denmark and head of state in the country - which is a constitutional monarchy - as well as in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Watch: Queen of Denmark announces abdication live on TV

Queen Margrethe II is the world's only reigning queen and the longest serving current monarch in Europe, taking the throne after the death of her father King Frederik IX in 1972.

The 83-year-old revealed the decision was made after a period of reflection following surgery on her back in early 2023.

By Tom Geoghegan BBC News

Reuters

Mr Trump faces several legal challenges heading into the 2024 presidential race

Donald Trump has been disqualified from running as a presidential candidate in two states, Colorado and Maine. So what does it mean for next year's general election?

Mr Trump is the clear frontrunner to be the Republican nominee in November 2024 and challenge Joe Biden for the White House. His campaign described both decisions as ""atrocious"" and an ""attempted theft of an election"".

The top election official in Maine ruled the former president was ineligible to run because of his actions around the Capitol riot. Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier.

But it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out.

Why did Maine make this ruling?

Unlike in Colorado, where the state's Supreme Court ruled on Mr Trump's eligibility, in Maine it was decided by the top electoral official because of a quirk in its constitution.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, issued a 34-page ruling that said Mr Trump must be removed from its Republican primary ballot because of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Section 3 disqualifies people who engage in ""insurrection or rebellion"" from holding federal office.

Her order said Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"".

Ms Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. She denied this and said it was ""thorough and based on the rule of law"".

Speaking to BBC News after her ruling, Ms Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the ""Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide"".

What happened in Colorado?

On 19 December, the Colorado Supreme Court said it found ""clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection"".

It was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

The lengthy 213-page ruling said Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to 6 January 2021 did constitute insurrection.

His lawyers had argued in Colorado that he should not be disqualified because he did not bear responsibility for the riot.

They also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection.

Can Donald Trump still stand in the 2024 election?

Yes. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively.

Hours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. Michigan's top court this week declined to hear a case seeking to disqualify Mr Trump.

Mr Trump is far ahead of his Republican rivals so can still win his party's nomination without competing in Colorado or Maine.

In the US, the two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses that begin in January.

In terms of the general election, in both states, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more.

What happens next?

It is now likely that the US Supreme Court will intervene to offer a ruling that would apply nationally.

That's because the Colorado Republican Party has appealed the state's ruling to the Supreme Court.

The top US court will decide whether to take up the case in the new year, but it is not clear when.

Mr Trump's name will remain on the ballot in Colorado until the Supreme Court makes a ruling or, in a less likely outcome, decides not to take up the case.

The Maine ruling is also on hold pending a legal appeal in the state's courts. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally.

The US justices will have to consider the legal arguments which will take time, but they will be under pressure to decide before the Colorado and Maine primaries on 5 March, the so-called Super Tuesday when the greatest number of states hold ballots.

The balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president.

Almost everything about the situation is unprecedented, leaving lingering questions about how this may affect the general election.

Maeva Marcus, the director of the Institute for Constitutional Studies at George Washington University, says the same ""rationale"" behind the Colorado ruling that disqualified Mr Trump from the primary ballot would ""hold for the general election"".

But it's too early to say what will happen in the general election in November until the issue works its way through the courts, she said.

Where do legal experts stand on this?

There are two key legal issues to consider.

One is whether Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to the storming of the US Capitol amount to insurrection.

The other is whether the office holders that Section 3 was aimed at barring should include the president.

A lower court in Colorado has already ruled that Mr Trump engaged in insurrection but the law did not apply to the office of the presidency.

The Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump.

Lawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech.

What is the political impact?

Mr Trump's campaign said the latest ruling is another example of the justice system being used to persecute him.

But there could be wider implications for the general election.

Dozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed.

If Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought.","Can Donald Trump still run for president after Maine and Colorado rulings?

The conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year. The front lines have hardly moved in the last few months but could the course of the war change in 2024?

President Volodomyr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped. Russia still controls about 18% of Ukraine.

We asked three military analysts how they think events may unfold in the coming 12 months.

War will drag on but not indefinitely

Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London

The prospects for an end of the war in Ukraine remain bleak. Compared with this time last year, Vladimir Putin is stronger, politically more than militarily.

The situation on the battleground remains uncertain. Recently, Ukraine's winter offensive seems to have come to a halt. But there is no Russian breakthrough, either. More than ever, the outcome depends on political decisions made miles away from the centre of the conflict - in Washington and in Brussels.

The West's impressive show of unity displayed in 2022, and that endured throughout 2023, is starting to vacillate.

The US defence aid package is held hostage by what President Biden rightly labelled ""petty politics"" in Washington. And the future of the EU's economic aid is seemingly dependent on Hungary's incongruous stance.

Hesitation in the West's capitals has emboldened Putin. His recent public appearances and defiant statements demonstrate that as far as he is concerned, Russia is in this for the long haul.

So, will the West have the strength and stamina to continue to oppose him and all that he represents?

The EU's decision to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova is more than just symbolic. It implicitly means continued backing for Kyiv, as a future in the EU for Ukraine would be impossible with a full-blown victory for Russia.

In Washington, a complete reversal of policy is unlikely.

While it is tempting to depict doomsday scenarios for US assistance as Trump's ratings rise in the polls, the former president, amid all the theatrics, did not walk out from Nato in 2016. And he would not singlehandedly be able to revolutionise America's 75-year-long transatlantic partnership.

This is not to say that the recent cracks in the Western camp are meaningless. For the West, and therefore for Ukraine, 2024 will be more difficult.

For democracies, long-term consensus in support for war has always been more complicated than for autocrats with no accountability.

While it is likely that the war will drag on throughout 2024, it cannot drag on indefinitely.

With Western hesitancy bolstering Russia, and in the absence of either a coup or a health-related issue leading to Putin's demise, the only foreseeable outcome will be a negotiated settlement that for now both sides continue to refuse.

A year of consolidation ahead

Michael Clarke, former director general of the Royal United Services Institute

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the return of major war to the European continent. The course of the conflict in 2023 marked the fact that industrial-age warfare had returned too.

Industrial-age warfare bends significant parts, or in some cases whole economies, towards the production of war materials as matters of priority. Russia's defence budget has tripled since 2021 and will consume 30% of government spending next year.

This will make the war in Ukraine a longer and more traumatic enterprise than anything Europe has known since the middle of the last century. The coming year will demonstrate whether Russia - and its suppliers in North Korea and Iran - or Ukraine - and its Western backers - are able and prepared to meet the voracious demands of industrial-age warfare.

It would be wrong to say that the front lines in Ukraine are stalemated, but both sides are capable of fighting each other to a standstill as they each try to take strategic initiatives.

Russian forces may try to push again along the entire front, at least to secure all of the Donbas region. Ukraine will probably try to exploit the success it has had in re-establishing its control over the western Black Sea and its vital trade corridor to the Bosphorus.

And Kyiv will likely also try to spring more military surprises on the Russian invaders to knock them off balance in some areas.

But in essence, 2024 looks like being a year of consolidation for both Kyiv and Moscow.

Russia lacks the equipment and trained manpower to launch a strategic offensive until spring 2025, at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Ukraine needs Western finance and military support to keep it in the war during next year while it, too, builds up its intrinsic strengths to create the conditions for a series of liberating offensives in the future.

Industrial-age warfare is a struggle between societies. What happens on the battlefield becomes ultimately only the symptom of that struggle.

The military course of this war in 2024 will be determined in Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang more than in Avdiivka, Tokmak, Kramatorsk or any of the devastated battlefields along the frontlines.

Ukraine will press Russia around Crimea

Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe

Russia lacks a decisive, breakthrough capability to overrun Ukraine and will do what it can to hold on to what it currently occupies, using the time to strengthen its defences while it hopes for the West to lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.

But Ukraine will not stop. It is in a fight for its survival and understands what Russia will do if it stops. More European nations are now talking about the need to step up aid in light of concerns that the US is weakening in its resolve.

Getty Images

I do, however, anticipate that early in the new year the US will rediscover its strategic backbone and pass the aid package that was delayed in Congress in December.

Therefore, I anticipate Ukraine will do the following in the coming months as it prepares to regain the initiative:

reconstitute units which have been worn down from months of fighting, which will be necessary for a renewed offensive

improve the recruiting system within Ukraine to maximise available manpower

increase production of ammunition and weapons

improve its ability to operate against strong Russian electronic warfare capabilities - jamming, intercepting, locating.

By early summer Ukraine will be able to use US-made F16 fighter jets for the first time, which it hopes will improve its ability to counter Russian aircraft and strengthen its own air defences.

The most strategically important part of Ukraine that remains occupied by Russia is Crimea, which is what we call the ""decisive terrain"".

Ukraine will do all it can to keep pressure on the Russians there to make it untenable for the Russian navy in Sevastopol, the handful of air force bases there and their logistics base at Dzankoy.

They have already proven the concept. With just three UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles, they have forced the commander of the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw a third of his fleet from Sevastopol.

The Ukrainians do not have unlimited resources of course, especially artillery ammunition and long-range precision weapons.","Ukraine war: Three ways the conflict could go in 2024Getty ImagesA Ukrainian soldier looks out from a tank near Bakhmut, eastern UkraineThe conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its third calendar year.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/67414003,David Warner: Why Australia's man of many personas bows out an ODI great,['Author not found'],"David Warner scored more than 500 runs at last year's Cricket World Cup

A version of this article was first published on 14 November, 2023.

More than most athletes, David Warner's public life has featured the man in a series of versions.

The early brawler, the reformed sage, the repeat offender, the penitent observer of silence, the strategist, the troublemaker, the king of the kids, the petulant self-justifier, the granular cricket analyst, the late-career paragon.

Some may have been more sincere than others, though there have at least been times when Warner has appeared to believe in them all.

Accordingly, he is received differently by locale.

In England, accentuate the negative: start by scoffing at his 95 runs in the 2019 Ashes, return to sandpaper if required. Some thoughtful and fair-minded people are genuine in their lasting deploration of his ball-tampering, but those whose default response to his name is to yell or type ""Cheat!"" are generally marked by less originality and understanding of nuance.

In India, conversely, Warner is hugely popular - the legacy of 14 seasons of Indian Premier League service and an ability to perceive which side of the naan is buttered.

In the manner of counterfeit jersey vendors only offering India shirts bearing Virat or Rohit, the Australian options are Warner or Maxwell.

Warner caters to to this pointedly, especially to the Telugu market in Hyderabad where he played seven seasons, roping his daughters in for Tollywood [Hyderabad-based cinema] dance videos on social media and replicating the moves on the field.

In Australia, reception is mixed. Some cricket watchers were put off years ago by his attitude - an on-field personality that was deliberately abrasive long before other techniques followed suit.

Some still resent the embarrassment of the sandpaper situation. Others enjoy his combativeness and respect his temperament - the one that involves more an inability than an unwillingness to give up.

Those judgements tend to colour how people perceive his cricket, especially in the latter years of his international career, when Test runs became more of a struggle.

David Warner has the name of his wife and children sewn into his cricket boots

His achievements are immense: only four opening batters have exceeded his 111 Tests doing that job, and only three bettered his 8,695 runs. An average that once topped 50 but has declined to 44 leaves him now in the category of the very good, rather than the greats who only need one name: Tendulkar, Ponting, Sangakkara.

Where he could strengthen a claim to be grouped with those three is in one-day cricket. As the format has become less loved, so have its performances become less valued, except perhaps for Virat Kohli's march to 50 centuries.

At the top of the list for all World Cup runs, Tendulkar has 2,278, Kohli has 1,794 and Ponting 1,743. Rohit Sharma is just out of the podium places on 1,575 with Sangakkara fifth on 1,532 and Warner only another five runs adrift.

That's with Warner and Rohit having played substantially fewer innings: last year was their third World Cup, compared to Kohli and Sangakkara with four, Ponting five and Tendulkar six.

But Ponting and Warner are the only ones in that group to actually win the thing more than once. Ponting had a famous streak of three, with Adam Gilchrist and Glenn McGrath. Warner's victory last year added to success in 2015. Tendulkar and Kohli won together in 2011, Rohit wasn't in that team, Sangakkara lost two finals.

Warner joining such elite company underlined his gift for 50-over cricket, something perhaps under-appreciated with modern scheduling affording little chance to play.

Warner played ODIs across 15 years but averaged just over 10 a year. Yet these have returned disproportionate rewards. For instance: Warner's 161 matches produced 22 centuries. Ponting played 214 more times and made 29.

Warner trails only the two Waughs, Ponting, Gilchrist, and Michael Clarke in terms of ODI runs for Australia. Steve Waugh played 164 more games and leads Warner by 637 runs.

The bulk of scoring from limited opportunity exceeds any team-mate or predecessor by a distance. Warner's record is singular.

Most singular of all was the energy in last year's World Cup. Australia's huge Test year showed. Cameron Green was a shadow, Smith was patchy, Pat Cummins at times seemed worn, while Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood were not always at their best.

But, having turned 37 during the campaign, Warner was fresh as a spring lamb. He hurled himself into innings, attacking bowling with the confidence of old, hitting the roofs of stadiums, sprinting runs, and setting the fielding standard in the deep.

It was the best he had batted in years - and a fitting way to end one of the great ODI careers.","David Warner scored more than 500 runs at last year's Cricket World CupA version of this article was first published on 14 November, 2023.

PA Media

Lewis Capaldi said he was working to improve symptoms caused by Tourette's Syndrome and anxiety

Lewis Capaldi has confirmed he will be extending his break from touring after a six-month hiatus improved his health.

In June he announced that he would halt his performing schedule ""for the foreseeable future"".

The announcement came after the singer-songwriter struggled with his voice during a Glastonbury set.

In a post on social media, he said he was working with professionals to help manage his Tourette's Syndrome and anxiety.

The 27-year-old said: ""I'm really happy to say I've noticed a marked improvement in both since I decided to take some time off back in June.""

The singer of ""Someone You Loved"" said he would also release an extended version of his second album ""Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent"" featuring five new songs on Monday.

He said: ""For now I'm going to continue taking some time to carry on looking after myself, maybe writing some music and taking a moment to reflect on some of the most incredible years of my life.

""I want to make absolutely sure I'm 100% before getting back out there again properly for more shows and doing what I love more than anything.

""These songs mean the world to me and I'd be gutted if I'd not been able to share them. Hope this tides you all over until we can get in a room and sing them together some day very soon.""

He also thanked fans for their support, saying their reaction had been ""nothing I've ever experienced and has made me more excited than ever to return to doing what I love at some point in the not too distant future"".

In the Netflix documentary ""Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now"", Capaldi spoke about how the pressures of fame had affected him mentally and physically.

After the success of his first album ""Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent"", expectations were high for the follow-up and he spoke about the impact of that pressure in the documentary.

In his social media post, he said: ""If you saw the film I made on Netflix, you probably know this already.

""But I was absolutely terrified of disappointing you all, afraid of not living up to expectations and in all honesty scared that the whole thing would be a complete flop.

""But thanks to all of you, it wasn't. It's mind-blowing to see the songs on this album still resonating with so many of you despite the fact I've not been out there promoting it or touring, it means the world to me.""

""Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent"" garnered 95,000 chart units during its first week on sale in May 2023.

It had held the title for biggest opening of the year until Taylor Swift released her rerecording of her 2014 album ""1989"".","Singer Lewis Capaldi extends tour break after health improvesPA MediaLewis Capaldi said he was working to improve symptoms caused by Tourette's Syndrome and anxietyLewis Capaldi has confirmed he will be extending his break from touring after a six-month hiatus improved his health.

Isro successfully launched a satellite for the exploration of celestial objects like black holes

India's space agency has successfully launched a rocket that is carrying an observatory which will study astronomical objects like black holes.

It was launched from Sriharikota spaceport at 09:10 local time (03:40GMT) on Monday.

This is only the second mission in the world of this nature after Nasa launched one in 2021.

The space agency said it wanted to help scientists improve their ""knowledge of black holes"".

""We will have an exciting time ahead,"" Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairperson S Somanath said after the launch.

A black hole is a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself. The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

Black holes emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars, and some are truly huge - their size billions of times the mass of our Sun.

Isro's satellite - X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) - will aim to conduct in-depth research on black holes.

Built at an approximate cost of 250m rupees ($30m; £23.5m), the XPoSat satellite is estimated to have a lifespan of five years.

The launch comes after a hugely successful year for Isro. In August, its Moon mission Chandrayaan-3 touched down near the lunar South Pole region, an area that no-one had reached before. Days later, it launched Aditya-L1 - its first observation mission to the Sun.

Monday's launch is just one among several projects Isro has planned to carry out this year.

""2024 is going to be the year for Gaganyaan readiness,"" Mr Somnath said, referring to the project which aims to send three astronauts into low-Earth orbit and bring them back after three days.

Isro carried out the first in a series of tests flights for the mission in October 2023 and aims to be ready for the manned mission by 2025.

Campaigning Australian journalist and filmmaker John Pilger has died aged 84, his family has announced.

A statement by his relatives on X said he died in London on Saturday.

They described Pilger as ""simply the most amazing and loved dad, grandad and partner"".

He was a vocal and sometimes controversial critic of Western foreign policy. He was also outspoken over the treatment of Indigenous Australians.

Pilger was born in Bondi, New South Wales in 1939, but was based in the United Kingdom since the 1960s. He worked for outlets including Reuters and the Daily Mirror.

He was best known for his work as a foreign correspondent, including reporting on the Vietnam War, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and from the United States during the turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s.

He was in the same room when Robert Kennedy was assassinated while running to be the Democratic nominee for the 1968 presidential election, according to his website.

He made numerous documentaries, including the 1979 film Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia, about the country under Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, as well as many about Australia and its treatment of Indigenous Australians.

In a 1990 interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he had always been ""interested in the victims of war, the people running the other way"".

""Journalism is nothing if it's not about humanity - it has to be about people's lives,"" he said.

He won numerous awards throughout his career, including Britain's Journalist of the Year Award in 1967 and 1979, and Bafta's Richard Dimbleby Award for factual reporting in 1991.

In recent years, he was a high-profile supporter of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange - who is currently in Belmarsh Prison, fighting extradition to the US on charges related to the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011.

He has described Assange as a ""truth teller who has committed no crime but revealed government crimes and lies on a vast scale"".

The official Wikileaks X account described Pilger as a ""ferocious speaker of truth to power"".

Former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan described Pilger as ""a brilliant firebrand journalist and ferocious holder of the powerful to proper account"".

John Simpson, the BBC's world affairs editor, said that although he disagreed with Pilger over the years, ""I admired the force of his writing, even when I often didn't support what he wrote, and he was always warm when we met"".

Former Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow called Pilger ""a great and steadfast journalist"".

Kevin Lygo, from ITV - on which many of Pilger's documentaries were broadcast - called him a ""giant of campaign journalism"".

Pilger also courted controversy with his comments on Russia. In a 2014 article for The Guardian, he wrote that President Vladimir Putin was ""the only leader to condemn the rise of fascism in 21st-century Europe"".

He also told Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, that the Russian nerve agent attack in Salisbury in 2018 was ""a carefully constructed drama in which the media plays a role"".","John Pilger: Campaigning Australian journalist diesGetty ImagesCampaigning Australian journalist and filmmaker John Pilger has died aged 84, his family has announced.

Santiago Sánchez, right, and a friend walk in Iraq's Kurdistan region in August

Iran's embassy in Spain says it has released Santiago Sánchez: a Spanish football fan detained during a trek from Madrid to Qatar for the men's 2022 football World Cup, and held in Tehran.

In a statement on X, the Iranian embassy said Mr Sánchez's release came thanks to the two countries' ""friendly and historical relations"".

All contact from Mr Sánchez was lost as he neared the final leg of his trip.

He was detained after visiting Mahsa Amini's grave, Spanish media report.

Ms Amini died in custody after being arrested by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab ""improperly"".

Her death sparked a wave of protests in Iran and beyond in 2022 - and many Iranians continue to defy a deadly crackdown by security forces.

Prior to Mr Sánchez's disappearance in October 2022, he shared each leg of his mammoth journey on social media.

A former paratrooper and passionate Real Madrid fan, he began the trip in January 2022, travelling across Europe, Turkey and Iraq - before being held in Iran for more than a year.

In a post on social media the day before he went silent, Mr Sánchez shared a series of photos with the caption: ""Last village in northern Iraq, a mountain separates me from reaching Iran, the next country before reaching Qatar"".

At the time of Mr Sánchez's detention, his friend Francho Salamanca told the BBC: ""He has been arrested and he is now in a Tehran prison"".

He said his friend had been upbeat about travelling through Iran, and had done a similar journey to get to Saudi Arabia in 2019.

Mr Sánchez began - and then postponed - a hunger strike in detention in September, Spain's ABC broadcaster reported. Relatives were quoted saying he postponed the protest after the prison director said he could see a doctor for his toothaches.

News of his whereabouts came after weeks of mounting concern from his family and friends.

In the same statement on social media, the Iranian embassy in Spain said Mr Sánchez was the only Spanish national held in Iran.

Ana Baneira Suarez, a Spanish activist who worked for a human rights NGO, was arrested in Tehran in November 2022 - but released the following February.

Police in Utah originally said they believed Kai Zhuang, 17, may have been kidnapped and held for ransom

Police in the US searching for a missing Chinese exchange student, initially feared kidnapped, have said he could in fact be camping.

Kai Zhuang, 17, was last seen on Wednesday at his host family's home in the town of Riverdale in Utah.

Police originally said it is possible he is being held against his will.

Officers were alerted to concerns about Kai's welfare on Thursday by the school he was attending, which had been contacted by his parents in China.

Kai's parents in China claimed to school officials they had been sent a ransom demand and a picture of their son indicating he was abducted, according to an earlier statement from police.

But in a later press release, Riverdale Police Department said they have reason to believe Kai could be camping in a tent in the Wasatch Front area of Utah, according 2KUTV - an affiliate of the BBC's US partner CBS News.

Undated CCTV images released by the force on Saturday showed him walking through a shop. He reportedly bought camping supplies several times recently.

Police say they are worried Kai could be in danger because of the cold weather.

Officers also said he had interactions with police in nearby Provo on 20 December and had camping gear with him at the time.

In a press conference on Thursday, Riverdale police chief Casey Warren said there was no evidence Kai had been forcibly taken from his host home.","Kai Zhuang: Police in Utah say student feared kidnapped may be 'camping'By Adam Durbin BBC NewsRiverside Police DepartmentPolice in Utah originally said they believed Kai Zhuang, 17, may have been kidnapped and held for ransomPolice in the US searching for a missing Chinese exchange student, initially feared kidnapped, have said he could in fact be camping.

South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae myung

The leader of South Korea's political opposition was stabbed at a news conference in the southern port city of Busan, Yonhap news agency reports.

Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the presidential elections in 2022, was stabbed on the left side of his neck on Tuesday morning.

The male attacker was arrested at the scene.

Mr Lee sustained a 1cm laceration on his neck and was treated in the hospital while conscious, Yonhap said.

The attacker who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, reportedly approached Mr Lee asking for an autograph, before suddenly lunging forward to stab him.

Videos of the attack on social media show Mr Lee first collapsing into the crowd and then onto the ground, while several people try to restrain the attacker. Photographs after the incident show Mr Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed as someone presses a handkerchief to the side of his neck.

Yonhap said he was airlifted to hospital in a helicopter.

Mr Lee, 59, leads the Democratic Party of Korea. He is not currently a member of South Korea's legislature but is widely expected to run for a seat in the next general election, which will take place in April 2024.

He narrowly lost the 2022 presidential elections - by a mere 0.73% difference in votes - to current President Yoon Suk-yeol, making it the closest presidential race in South Korean history. He is widely expected to stand in the next presidential elections in 2027.

Since then he has been indicted on corruption and breach of trust charges, with prosecutors accusing him of allowing private developers to profit illegally from a property project while he was mayor of Seongnam, a city of 1 million people to the south of Seoul. Mr Lee has denied those charges, calling them politically motivated.

In September a court dismissed a request from the prosecution for him to be held in custody while he awaited trial on the charges. Prosecutors are still investigating him on a number of other cases linked to corruption while he was in office.","Lee Jae-myung: South Korea opposition leader stabbed in Busan.

Jeremy Renner: ""I'm just so blessed I had so many things to live for""

Marvel films actor Jeremy Renner said knowing he has ""a lot to fight for"" helped him survive the aftermath of a snow plough accident a year ago.

Renner, 52, was in critical condition after breaking more than 30 bones after being accidentally run over by his own snow plough, on New Year's Day 2022.

He told CNN: ""I'm just so blessed I had so many things to live for, I have a giant family, a 10-year-old daughter.""

The only option he gave himself was to ""get better"".

""I would have disappointed and really messed up a lot of people's lives if I would have passed,"" said the actor, who plays Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

""I'm also pretty stubborn, there's a lot for me to fight for and recovery was just a one-way road in my mind and my recovery.""

Renner/Instagram

The police accident report said Renner tried to enter the snow plough's cab to stop the vehicle moving

The accident happened after a new year storm hit the US, dumping heavy snowfall across several states.

Renner used his snow plough to rescue his nephew who was driving a car, but had got stuck in the snow near his house.

He successfully towed the car free, but when he got out, the plough began to move while unattended, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said at the time.

Renner was trying to get back into the driver's seat to stop it moving, when the ""extremely large"" piece of equipment ran him over, Mr Balaam added.

The actor was airlifted to hospital in Reno, Nevada, and spent some time in an intensive care unit.

He told CNN about the trauma for his ""poor nephew"" who saw him being run over, saying: ""I gave him you know, images that he can never unsee"".

But he added: ""I know that my healing would be healing for him"", as well as others close to him affected by the accident, such as his daughter.

He said he had ""never thought about my own physical ailments or my own pain or my own anguish - so the one-way road to recovery was like a mental attitude.

""And that attitude was always to get better. And there's no option other than that.""

On his Instagram stories, Renner shared an image of him hugging his nephew after speaking to CNN, and wrote: ""Post-interview love from my sweet nephew who helped save my life.""

""Paying my respects and celebrating love, life and the blessings it brings to us all. Thank you and this community for keeping me here. I'm forever in your debt with gratitude"".

The actor is probably best-known for his role in the Marvel films, but he also starred in 2008 film The Hurt Locker - for which he received a best actor Oscar nomination - as well as Wind River, American Hustle and Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol.

Renner was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for his role in 2010 film The Town.

By Hannah Ritchie BBC News, Sydney

Desree Pether

An Australian man whose family argue he is being ""held hostage"" in Iraq has now spent 1,000 days in prison.

Robert Pether was jailed in 2021 on fraud charges, but the UN has described it as an arbitrary detention.

After three Christmases behind bars, his family says Mr Pether has hit ""rock bottom"" and that his health is rapidly deteriorating.

His lawyer is calling on the Australian government to urgently secure the father of three's release.

Desree Pether worries that her husband - who has lost a third of his body weight since being arrested - may die in prison and never see his children Flynn 20, Oscar 18, and Nala 11, again.

""There's no light at the end of the tunnel and so many moments have been stolen from us,"" she told the BBC.

""Nala wrote to Santa this year asking if he could stop by Iraq and pick up her dad up on the way through - I said that Santa can't get involved in political matters.""

A mechanical engineer, Mr Pether had gone to Iraq to rebuild its Central Bank headquarters in Baghdad.

But a contract dispute between the bank and his employer - CME Consulting - landed Mr Pether and his Egyptian colleague Khalid Radwan in prison, after the bank accused the men of stealing money from the project.

After behind held without charge for almost six months, and then subjected to a speedy trial, the two were each given a five-year jail sentence and slapped with a joint fine of $12m (A$17.5m, £9.4m).

However, a 2022 report from the UN determined that the case contravened international law and that Mr Pether and Mr Khalid had been subjected to ""abusive and coercive"" interrogations.

Iraq's government has previously denied allegations of ill treatment, but the matter is now under investigation by the UN's Special Rapporteur on torture.

And earlier this year, the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) Court of Arbitration ruled that Iraq's central bank was at fault in the dispute with CME and ordered it to pay $13m to the company.

UK human rights lawyer Peter Griffin, who is representing Mr Pether, says the ICC finding ""completely undercuts Iraq's argument that Robert's imprisonment is justified"" by the ""supposed wrongdoings"" of the company he worked for.

""That is now totally disproven and cannot provide the basis for his incarceration,"" he told the BBC.

Mr Griffin believes that Iraq is holding Mr Pether ""in the hope that it can parlay his release into some sort of financial gain"" and says that the Australian government needs to ""up its game"".

""We have all seen the great lengths that some countries will go to secure the release of their nationals in similar situations... if Robert was from the US or UK, he would have been home long ago.""","Robert Pether: Australian jailed in Iraq reaches 1,000-day milestoneBy Hannah Ritchie BBC News, SydneyDesree PetherAn Australian man whose family argue he is being ""held hostage"" in Iraq has now spent 1,000 days in prison.

A protester outside the Supreme Court in September last year

Israel's Supreme Court has struck down a controversial judicial reform that triggered nationwide protests last year against the Netanyahu government.

The change would have limited the power of the Supreme Court in overturning laws it deemed unconstitutional.

Critics say it would have severely undermined the country's democracy by weakening the judicial system.

There is strong opposition to the current Netanyahu government, seen as the most right-wing in Israeli history.

The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the law passed by the government in 2023 follows months of internal turmoil.

In July, the government passed into law what is now known as the ""reasonableness"" bill.

This removed the power of the Supreme Court and lower courts in Israel to cancel government decisions it deemed to be ""extremely unreasonable"".

The law caused widespread anger and division, prompting hundreds of thousands of protesters to take the streets calling for the reforms to be scrapped - and for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Organisers said the weekly protests were the biggest street demonstrations in Israel's history.

At the time, hundreds of military reservists - including air force pilots - threatened to refuse to report for service, which led to warnings that this could impair Israel's military capabilities.

A statement from the Supreme Court said that 8 out of 15 judges ruled against the law, adding it would have caused ""severe and unprecedented damage to the basic characteristics of the State of Israel as a democratic state"".

Israel's justice minister and architect of the law Yariv Levin criticised the judges for ""taking into their hands all the powers"" and called their decision to strike it down undemocratic.

But opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the verdict, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the country's top court had ""faithfully fulfilled its role in protecting the citizens of Israel"".

One of the organisers involved in last year's large-scale protests against the law also welcomed the court's ruling.

Shikma Bressler said in a video statement that the Supreme Court had for the moment removed ""the sword of dictatorship from around our necks"".

The ""reasonableness"" law was part of a wider series of judicial reforms introduced by the Netanyahu government.

These would have weakened the power of the Supreme Court to review or throw out laws, enabling a simple majority of one in the Knesset (parliament) to overrule such decisions.

The government has also attempted to gain greater power over appointing judges, and to scrap the requirement for ministers to obey the advice of their legal advisers.

Mr Netanyahu has argued that the changes are required to redress the balance between the judges and the politicians.

The Supreme Court's ruling threatens to further undermine confidence in his government. Mr Netanyahu's Likud party said the decision opposed ""the will of the people for unity, especially during wartime"".","Israel Supreme Court strikes down judicial reformsBy Shaimaa Khalil in Jerusalem & Ali Abbas Ahmadi in London BBC NewsGetty ImagesA protester outside the Supreme Court in September last yearIsrael's Supreme Court has struck down a controversial judicial reform that triggered nationwide protests last year against the Netanyahu government.

By Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Addis Ababa

Reuters

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (L) signed the memorandum of understanding with Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi in Addis Ababa

Ethiopia has taken the first legal steps on a path that could one day enable the landlocked country to gain access to the sea, its government says.

It has signed what is known as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the self-declared republic of Somaliland to use one of its ports.

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has previously described sea access as an existential issue for his country.

His statement in October prompted tensions across the Horn of Africa.

There were some fears, quickly dampened by the authorities, that this implied trying to take land from another of Ethiopia's neighbours, Eritrea.

The details of Monday's agreement with Somaliland have not been made public but a statement from Mr Abiy's office said it would ""pave the way to realise the aspiration of Ethiopia to secure access to the sea"". Talks leading up to the MoU have focused on the Somaliland port of Berbera.

Mr Abiy's national security adviser, Redwan Hussien, also said on X that the arrangement could also enable Ethiopia to access a ""leased military base"" on the sea.

An MoU is not legally binding but can lead to a treaty imposing obligations on those parties who have signed.

Nevertheless, the development is being portrayed by Addis Ababa as a major diplomatic victory.

The prime minister, who signed the MoU with Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi in the Ethiopian capital, wrote on X that ""all that can be said is thank God"".

Speaking at the signing, President Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent country at some point in the future.

Somaliland seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but is not recognised by the African Union (AU) or the UN as an independent state.

There has been no response regarding the announcement from Somalia, which considers Somaliland as part of its territory. But national broadcaster SNTV reports that there will be an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Ethiopia lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. With more than 100 million people, it is the most populous landlocked country in the world.

Up to now Ethiopia has been using the port in neighbouring Djibouti for the vast majority of its imports and exports.

In 2018 Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a deal that should have led to Addis Ababa owning a 19% stake of the port of Berbera, with the Emirati logistics company DP World holding a 51% share.","Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has previously described sea access as an existential issue for his country.

By Anbarasan Ethirajan BBC News

A court in Bangladesh has sentenced the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to six months in jail for violating the country's labour laws.

Prof Yunus' supporters say the case is politically motivated.

The acclaimed economist and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom - one of the firms he founded - were found guilty of failing to create a welfare fund for their workers.

All four deny any wrongdoing and have been granted bail pending appeals.

""As my lawyers have convincingly argued in court, this verdict against me is contrary to all legal precedent and logic,"" Prof Yunus said in a statement released after the verdict.

""I call for the Bangladeshi people to speak in one voice against injustice and in favour of democracy and human rights for each and every one of our citizens.""

The 83-year-old Yunus, known internationally as the ""banker to the poor"", is credited with establishing a pioneering system of micro-finance loans helping to lift millions out of poverty.

Prof Yunus and his Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in 2006.

Discussing the verdict, one of his lawyers, Abdullah Al Mamun, told the BBC: ""It was an unprecedent judgement. No due legal process was followed in the case and it was rushed through.""

Mr Mamun added: ""The whole idea is to damage his international reputation. We are appealing against this verdict.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike in Ukraine in response to a Ukrainian attack on the city of Belgorod

President Vladimir Putin has pledged to ""intensify"" attacks against Ukraine, following days of aerial bombardment by both sides in the long-running war.

Speaking during a visit to a military hospital in Moscow, Mr Putin said the military would continue targeting Ukrainian ""military installations"".

He called an air raid on the Russian city of Belgorod by Ukraine a ""deliberate strike against civilians"".

Twenty-five people were killed in Saturday's attack, local officials say.

Speaking to Russian servicemen on Monday, Mr Putin said the war was turning in Moscow's favour and he wanted the war to end quickly, but only on Russia's terms.

He added that Ukraine's Western supporters were the biggest obstacle to ending the conflict, but said their rhetoric was beginning to change as they started to realise they could not ""destroy"" Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky countered these claims in an interview with The Economist, saying Mr Putin's suggestion that Russia was winning the war was only a ""feeling"".

He highlighted Russia's casualty figures in Ukraine, and said the opposing forces had been unable to take a single large city in 2023.

Mr Zelensky also expressed frustration with Kyiv's Western allies, saying they had lost a sense of urgency.

The two leaders earlier delivered new year messages.

On Sunday, Mr Putin hailed Russian soldiers as ""heroes"" without explicitly referring to the war in Ukraine.

In his own address to mark the start of 2024, Mr Zelensky promised a sharp increase in the number of weapons produced by the country - pledging to build at least a million drones.

Russia says a Ukrainian attack on the city of Belgorod damaged buildings including a shopping centre

Russia and Ukraine have exchanged deadly attacks over the past few days.

Ukraine shelled the Russia-held Ukrainian cities of Donetsk on New Year's Eve, according Moscow-installed officials, which killed at least four people and wounded 13.

And on Saturday, Ukrainian forces launched a series of strikes on targets in south-west Russia, including the strike on Belgorod which Mr Putin termed a ""terrorist attack"".

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Monday that the death toll had risen to 25 following the death of a young child who was seriously injured in the attack.

""Today, a 4-year-old girl died in a regional children's hospital. She was in a highly serious condition with combined injuries to the chest and internal organs,"" Mr Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The girl's death brought the number of child victims of the attack to five, the governor said. He added that 109 people were wounded in the air raid, with 45 currently in hospital.","Putin vows to 'intensify' attacks against Ukraine military targetsBy Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC NewsReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike in Ukraine in response to a Ukrainian attack on the city of BelgorodPresident Vladimir Putin has pledged to ""intensify"" attacks against Ukraine, following days of aerial bombardment by both sides in the long-running war.

By Jacqueline Howard & Oliver Slow BBC News

Watch: Queen of Denmark announces abdication live on TV

Denmark's Queen Margrethe II has announced her surprise abdication in a new year TV address.

She will formally step down on 14 January, which will be 52 years to the day since she became queen.

""I will leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik,"" she announced.

The 83-year-old is the world's only reigning queen and the longest serving current monarch in Europe, taking the throne after the death of her father King Frederik IX in 1972.

Unlike British royal tradition, there will be no formal crowning ceremony for Crown Prince Frederik, who is 55. Instead, his accession will be announced from Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen on the day.

He will take her place as King of Denmark and head of state in the country - which is a constitutional monarchy - as well as in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

His Australian-born wife, Princess Mary, will become Denmark's Queen Consort.

Queen Margrethe revealed that she came to the decision after a period of reflection following surgery on her back in early 2023.

""The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,"" she said.

""I have decided that now is the right time,"" she added, and offered her thanks to the Danish public for their support over the years.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen thanked the queen for her service ""lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom.""

""Although the duty and position of regent has been handed down for more than 1,000 years, it is still difficult to understand that the time has now come for a change of throne,"" she said in a statement.

""Many of us have never known another regent. Queen Margrethe is the epitome of Denmark and throughout the years has put words and feelings into who we are as a people and as a nation.""

Queen Margrethe II and Queen Elizabeth II in the year 2000

Queen Margrethe is a popular figure in Denmark, and many Danes had expected her to remain on the throne until her death.

""She is to us what Queen Elizabeth was to you,"" Danish journalist Tine Gotzsche told the BBC.

Queen Margrethe attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, and they celebrated their respective jubilees in the same year.

She had not been expected to become Queen when she was born. But when she was 13, Danish law changed to allow women to take the throne.

More than a decade ago, Queen Margrethe reflected that she was inspired by the late British Queen ""that I must somehow understand that I must dedicate my life to my nation like she has done, and in that way she has been very important to me.""

The pair had been the world's only remaining female sovereigns before Queen Elizabeth's death. Elizabeth reigned for 70 years.

Known for her smoking habits and rejection of mobile phones

Some also consider her the world's longest reigning monarch. The Sultan of Brunei has been on the throne for longer, but his country only gained independence in 1984.

She is also the longest-serving monarch in Danish history, after surpassing King Christian IV, of Denmark and Norway, earlier this year.

Affectionately known as Daisy, Queen Margrethe is known for her smoking habits and rejection of mobile phones and the internet - declaring herself ""very happy"" without them.

Gotzsche said the Danish royal transition is a moment of mixed celebration and sadness.

Crown Prince Frederik and Princess Mary attended the coronation of King Charles III in May

""She has always been there, she has been ageing with all of us,"" she said, but added: ""the Crown Prince is in a very good position to take over, the succession is laid out - it's very logical, and it absolutely makes sense.""

Crown Prince Frederik, like Britain's King Charles III, is known for his passion for the environment. He has vowed to ""guide the ship"" of Denmark into the future.

His wife, Princess Mary, grew up on the Australian island of Tasmania and was working as a lawyer when the pair met in 2000.

They are considered by some to represent modern values and have tried to give their four children as normal an upbringing as possible, sending them mainly to state schools.

During her time on the throne, Queen Margrethe continued to work as an artist and was well known for her love of the arts.

She also has a passion for archaeology and has taken part in several excavations.

She studied in the UK, spending time at Cambridge's Girton College and the London School of Economics.

In 1967, she married French diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who served as her royal consort until his death in 2018.

Each year on New Year's Eve, she delivers a speech broadcast on television.

This year, aside from the announcement, she also spoke of the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as the importance of addressing climate change.

Facing similar challenges of modern society as other royal families across Europe, the Danish royal family has decided to slim down its number of royals.

This led to a very public rift last year after Crown Prince Frederik's younger brother Prince Joachim's children were stripped of their royal titles.","Queen Margrethe II: Danish monarch announces abdication live on TVBy Jacqueline Howard & Oliver Slow BBC NewsWatch: Queen of Denmark announces abdication live on TVDenmark's Queen Margrethe II has announced her surprise abdication in a new year TV address.

A winter walk while it is cold is a good way to get some exercise that brings extra bonuses to your health (Credit: Getty Images)

The start of a new year is a time for making changes and resolutions to improve your health and wellbeing. We look at some of the best tips that science has to offer.

With the arrival of another new year, you might be reflecting on what you'd like to achieve and the kind of person you want to be over the next 12 months.

These failures can lead to what some psychologists describe as an annual cycle of ""false hope syndrome"". Instead, there's some evidence that it might be better to set goals that are more achievable. Research suggests that approach-orientated goals – those that are realistic, specific and where success can be easily measured – tend to be more successful than those that focus on abstaining or avoiding something, such as giving up smoking or drinking.

Deciding what to focus on, however, can be tough. So, to help you make up your mind, here are seven aspects of your life that you could focus on in the first week of the new year using some science-based tips.

By working with and against gravity, squats can help to pump blood to your brain and give it a boost (Credit: Getty Images)

Day 1: Focus on your sleep

After what might have been a late night ringing in the New Year, it perhaps makes sense to start by paying some attention to your sleep. And at this time of year, you don't need to feel guilty about hitting the snooze button – scientists say we should all be spending more time in bed during the winter.

And while you're spending more time in bed, you might also want to try lucid dreaming, a state of conscious awareness of dreaming while still asleep. Many people use lucid dreaming to help manage nightmares, solve problems, and explore creative ideas. Read more about how you can become a lucid dreamer in this feature by Jocelyn Timperley.

Watch: How to take control of your dreams

Day 2: Focus on your body

If you are a fidget, it's time to embrace it: those absent-minded movements such as a tapping foot, jigging knee or fiddling fingers can burn a surprising amount of calories and help to reduce stress.

But with the northern hemisphere in the grips of winter, it is also a good time to get out and do some exercise in the cold, which has been linked to better cardiac health, a stronger immune system and improved weight loss by turning white fat cells to brown.

While you are at it, you could even try turning around during your next walk and do it in reverse. Walking backwards has been found to burn more calories than going forwards, while also strengthening the muscles in your back. It is particularly recommended for people with knee problems as it reduces the strain on the knee joint while increasing the flexibility of the hamstrings. It can also give your brain a boost too.

And don't shy away from getting muddy on those backward walks; getting dirty can help to top up the diversity of beneficial microorgansims that live on our body. People with skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis tend to have an impoverished community of microbes on their skin.

As the largest organ in the body, skin is a surprisingly influential – and plays a curious role in shaping our health. Dry or damaged skin can release biochemicals that contribute to body-wide inflammation, eventually affecting other organs such as the heart and brain. Taking better care of this delicate organ, such as by using sunscreen and moisturiser – might not just help you to stay looking younger, but also improve your biological age. (Read more about the surprising ways our skin shapes our overall health in this article by Zaria Gorvett.)

Day 3: Focus on your mind

Talk to a stranger, enjoy a good scare, embrace the chaos of life. All of these things could help you to feel happier, more resilient and less stressed, according to science. You could also try something new. Challenging yourself by learning a new skill to ncrease brain plasticity, which helps the mind to adapt and rewire itself.

If you are feeling particularly energetic, you could also attempt some squats. By working with and against gravity, these deceptively simple exercises can give your brain a surprising boost in blood flow, which, in turn, can improve our cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills.

If that sounds like too much hard work, you could always just try thinking yourself young. Research shows that if you see yourself as young, you might just live longer. It might also be worth embracing the power of wonder too, whether that's by climbing a mountain, watching the ocean or marveling at a starry sky. Experiencing awe can reduce stress, boost memory and give you a greater sense of connection to others and the world around you.

Or why not indulge in a spot of singing – perhaps the world's most accessible stress reliever – and an aerobic exercise that releases endorphins, the brain's ""feel good"" chemicals.

Alternatively, you could just breathe. Research suggests that breathing exercises can reduce stress, anxiety, and lower blood pressure. They can also help you sleep. (Read more about the potential benefits of breathwork in this feature by Amanda Ruggeri.)

Day 4: Focus on your relationships

If you are looking for something a little more than friendship, you could do a lot worse than embracing your quirkiness. Slight changes in the clothes we wear, and having tastes and opinions that flout conventions can make us more attractive.

Adopting a different attitude towards forgiveness could also be a simple step that can bring multiple benefits to our lives. Although it can be hard, saying ""I forgive you"" – and actually meaning it – can reduce our stress levels, help us earn more money and even keep us healthier as we age.

Day 5: Focus on what you eat

December is rarely a time for calorie-counting or moderation, and rightly so. With festive tables littered with treats both savoury and sweet, many of us over-indulge – although contrary to popular belief, eating an outsized Christmas lunch doesn't really stretch your stomach. It is hardly surprising that so many of us start the new year with what we eat at the forefront of our minds.

If you still have leftovers from the festivities, eating them up rather than throwing them away is better for the climate. And while microwaving them might be frowned upon in polite circles, it can actually be the best way to retain the nutrients in food. Plus there shouldn't be any ill effects from doing so (though you might want to avoid using plastic containers for this.)

Coffee is one of those luxuries that can be good for you if drunk in moderation (Credit: Getty Images)

Eating a balanced diet is of course good at any time of year, but probably even better after all that indulgence. Research suggests that junk food – and yes, that includes the chocolates enjoyed from your post-lunch armchair – can be as bad for the mind as it can be for the body.

When it comes to fruit and vegetables, it's not just a case of eating your greens – studies have shown that a rainbow of different coloured fruit and veg can both boost brain health and cut down the chances of developing heart disease.

And while Dry January is a popular way to start the year, you don't have to do the same with coffee: research suggests that those who drink coffee have a lower risk of dying from stroke, heart disease or cancer. Although of course, it's important to consume coffee – like most things – in moderation.

Day 6 - Focus on your fitness

If you want to get fit quick, then just six sessions of interval training can increase maximal oxygen uptake, a measure of overall fitness, and the efficiency of our body's ability to burn the fuel stored in our cells.

Taking up a new hobby can help to keep your brain younger, help to fuel creativity – and stave off boredom

The time of day you exercise can also make a difference – at least where your performance is concerned. Research on Olympic swimmers and cyclists, for example, suggests that they tend to be faster in the evening. But it can also depend on your own circadian rhythms too.

For those looking to eke out an extra few repetitions in the gym or to shave some time off their personal best, it might be worth embracing the power of the placebo. Athletes who take inert pills have been shown to perform better than those who do not, an effect that mirrors what doctors see with medical placebos. But the effect also works with ""social placebos"" – training with others in a way that increases bonding and provides support can reduce the sense of fatigue and pain.

Day 7 - Focus on your hobbies

There's good news, too, if your preferred pastime is to curl up with a good book: people who read fiction are better at working out what others are thinking and feeling. And if you like to read aloud to others, it can not only improve your memory of what you are reading but also make it easier to understand complicated texts.

Watch: How boredom can be good for you

Bonus: Focus on your sex life

Our prehistoric ancestors loved it so much, they did it with Neanderthals. Even Britain's Queen Victoria was an enthusiastic participant. But despite this era-spanning passion for sex, its many mysteries are still being plumbed – and as more studies emerge, it's becoming easier to have a titillating time in the bedroom.

For one thing, adopting a ""sexual growth mindset"" by appreciating that intimate relationships must be carefully tended, rather than expected to work automatically, can help people to navigate problems in the bedroom.

Now there are also an abundance of apps which allow people to track their orgasms. These include ""biofeedback"" vibrators, for example, which use data from sensors inside to help people visualise their orgasms.

Watch: The smart way to improve your love life

For those fearing an awkward conversation with their children this year, research suggests that answering questions honestly and openly from a young age can set a positive pattern that makes it easier to talk about more complex issues later.

And banishing myths around sex more generally could be a positive step. For some women, losing their virginity is fraught with anxiety, judgement, and painful examinations, partly because of ancient ideas about the hymen. Learning how this small piece of tissue actually works, and changing the language we use to describe it, could help to improve sex for everyone. (Read more about the sex myth that destroys lives in this article by Sophia Smith-Galer.)

Strikes swept the globe in industries including automotive, transport, healthcare and more (Credit: Alamy)

AI, return-to-office, the summer of strikes and more: both labourers and employers found themselves working through a rollercoaster of changes this year.

The work world has been a moving target for a while now. In 2023, some of the unresolved issues of the past three years settled, especially around the return to office. Yet evolving technology and a surge in organised labour meant plenty of new themes cropped up. They combined for a year of work unlike any other.

AI began its inevitable rise

The launch of ChatGPT on 30 November

2022 set the stage for a tidal wave of workplace changes in 2023. The impact of artificial intelligence on the labour force ­– and the future of work as we know it – was perhaps the most high profile topic of the year. And for good reason.

Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers. Recruiters began to see job applicants sending in materials written with ChatGPT; workers began to integrate the technology into their daily jobs – depending on it to the point that they found ways to secretly access the tools if they were banned.

One of the most ubiquitous worries – even existential concerns – among workers was whether AI would come for their jobs, especially as 2023 data from firms including Goldman Sachs and McKinsey and Company indicated replacement-by-robot may be imminent for many people.

The answer is still murky. Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service. Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.

It's not quite time to panic, though. First, many experts say there are jobs that will be difficult to automate outright – especially roles that require a human touch, sophisticated interpersonal relationships or out-of-the-box thinking.

And for positions that might be more vulnerable, experts also predict AI will end up as a supplementary technology, instead of an outright mechanism for replacement. At this point, AI is largely automating rote, repetitive tasks that can be a time-suck for workers, and could free up employees to do higher-level, more creative tasks. It also could push them to upskill, which may have long-term benefits.

At this point, experts recommend workers embrace AI, rather than fear it. The more people can understand the technology – both what it can and can't do – the more they'll be poised to work with it in ways that can advance them, and help them stay valuable to their employers.

Return-to-office became a reality

For many workers, the days of resisting return-to-office policies are over. After nearly three years of push-and-pull between employees and bosses, millions of workers are back in offices, at least partially – whether or not they want to be.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow.

While many companies have stuck with hybrid set-ups, others, such as Goldman Sachs and Disney, have leaned hard into this newfound power, recalling their employees four-to-five days per week. Others, including Amazon, have threatened workers who ignore these mandates – either denying them the opportunity to advance, or moving to terminate their employment entirely. Many companies who haven't fully returned yet have plans to do so in 2024.

If the switch seems jarring, it is. Since some offices began reopening in early 2021, workers have largely been able to make their own rules about whether they come in or not, despite years of heavy-handed pushes from leaders. Yet as job opportunities have tightened, it's far more difficult to snub these directives, since the Great Resignation is ""over"", and most workers can't easily hop into another job. And even for the new roles that are popping up, just a small percentage offer a fully remote set-up.

Yet experts are important to caveat that workers haven't entirely lost, even if they're back into their daily commute a few times a week.

The mainstreaming of hybrid set-ups means workers still have unprecedented flexibility and are unlikely to lose it entirely. Kastle Systems, which tracks employee access-card swipes for many businesses, has shown office attendance in 2023 is still a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic. Going forward, many jobs will have a hybrid schedule – a privilege formerly afforded to a select few, mostly senior employees.

Labour found its voice

""Summer of strikes"", ""hot labour summer"" – whatever the name, workers made their voices heard in 2023. Across the world, millions of people throughout many sectors organised, looking for better conditions and wages as well as career security for the future.

In the UK and US, healthcare workers conducted high-profile strikes after years of pandemic-era burnout and understaffing. Workers in transport, education and service joined them in the hundreds of thousands. But two US-based strikes particularly captured attention on the global stage.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow

On 2 May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), representing more than 10,000 screenwriters, hit the picket line over issues including pay in the era of streaming-media dominance, and future protections against evolving AI technology. The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) also went on strike on 14 July, with the two powerful unions standing in solidarity over shared concerns.

Then, on 14 September, workers at the three largest automakers in the country – GM, Ford and Stellantis – walked off the job. The members of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) were not only looking for pay increases from the executives that make millions, but also seeking to secure their jobs in an industry that is increasingly moving towards EVs.

These disputes finally settled in the autumn, with all unions securing unprecedented gains, especially around wage boosts and job-futureproofing.

Experts say moments like this may be poised to continue. Not only have the successes of these labour movements inspired and empowered workers, but data also shows Gen Z is highly supportive of organised labour. As the next generation become a larger part of the workforce, they are likely to lead more pro-union pushes.

Work perks, redefined

Throughout the past few years, perks like ping-pong tables and kombucha on tap have faded as must-haves for worker satisfaction. The pandemic transformed what workers wanted from their employers, including new wellness benefits, or flexibility to work where and when they wished. Employers have largely listened – if not magnanimously, then at least out of the desire to attract and retain talent.

This year, perks have evolved even more, as workers across the globe have settled into their post-pandemic lives. Employers have begun to modernise their benefits suites as workers settled flexible work patterns, prioritised work-life balance and found themselves with different responsibilities at home.

Some companies are hoping to make jobs more fun, offering their workers multi-thousand-dollar travel stipends to unplug, or even doling out spot bonuses in the form of points redeemable for goods and services. Others are looking at things more tactically, offering perks such as pet-friendly offices and spaces for childcare – even donations to charity for each day in the office ­– to incentivise workers back to their desks.

Perhaps this year's most notable shift, however, is the expansion of perks catering to an oft-overlooked group of workers: Gen X. An increasing number of employers are integrating benefits that help this ""sandwich generation"" – often caring for children and ageing parents at once – live life a healthier, more balanced life. Some of these new offerings include menopause support, healthcare screenings, eldercare and even ""gran-ternity leave"".

Experts say these benefits are a direct way to address worker happiness, and can pay off for employers, too; firms can become more appealing employers for older workers, who are often of leadership age. It's often a good deal for both parties.

Living on #worktok

Work culture found its way onto social media in a big way this year with #worktok. Creators across many platforms – particularly TikTok – invited users to get ready with them for their workdays, and toured them through their offices and daily grinds, often amassing millions of views. Sometimes they complained about their employers, and even quit on livestreams (accordingly, #quittok).

Perhaps most notable were the commentaries on work culture that came from this social media moment. The ""lazy girl job"", coined in May by 26-year-old Gabrielle Judge, particularly resonated with a group of workers who want to clock fewer hours and do less work (who wouldn't?). Her videos racked up hundreds of hundreds of thousands of views, and launched a tag with millions of impressions.

The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts. This is especially true as work and life increasingly bleed into each other, and young people in particular have not had the formative workplace interactions to build real world relationships.

""If you're working from home, you don't have that water cooler moment. Maybe if you come into a job during the pandemic, you might not have workmates who you're super close with,"" says Sara McCorquodale, the founder of UK-based influencer intelligence business CORQ. Along with creating community, she says, #WorkTok enables people to put a voice to one of the most important facets of their lives. It won't stop anytime soon.

It's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce

Workers stayed put – but checked out

The Great Resignation defined the past few years in the workplace. It was a sign of worker empowerment; since 2020, millions of employees – especially in the US – left their jobs for new ones that made them happier, were more aligned with their values or improved the overall quality of their lives.

Yet as the labour market tightened this year amid mass layoffs and an uncertain economy, mid-2023 data began to show the turnover rate for US employees had normalised to pre-pandemic levels. The shift was so significant, that in August, economists declared the Great Resignation's finale.

For workers, this marked the end of an era in job mobility. And that's bred another problem: it's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce.

Subsequently, employees are leaning out of their work. Think the ""quiet quitting"" trend of 2022, at the next level.

In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work. This mentality doesn't only lead to pesky dissatisfaction – it can also contribute to lower levels of personal wellbeing, says Jim Harter, chief scientist for workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup.

This leaves workers in a bad place, of course, but companies also stand to suffer, since productivity and morale falls off a cliff with disengagement. So, as workers check out, experts say it's up to leaders to light their employees' fires again. That means investing in their careers, supporting them with the same earnestness they did during the pandemic and working on building culture.

It may be tempting for employers to sit back if they're not fearful their employees will leave – but such a decision stands to hurt everyone.

A serious look at four-day workweeks

Four-day workweek trials kicked off in 2022, and spread across the globe in 2023, both in public and private sectors. In many cases, they have been successful; after the large-scale UK four-day workweek pilot from February, 92% of participating employers said they would continue with a shorter workweek following the programme. Nearly a third made the change permanent.

Workers have reported lower burnout and stress, and relished the time off. Companies have loved seeing their workers happier and more engaged, which has led to sustained productivity and employee retention. More companies are giving the four-day workweek a go, with others codifying the set-up in the coming months. Some firms are also giving the format a try with the hope that a shorter week may lure workers back into the office.

Are 32-hour workweeks imminent for all workers? As positive as the results have been – and even as more firms jump in –­ probably not.

For instance, not every company that's tried it has declared the experiment a resounding success; some leaders found cramming five days of work into four was stressful for employees, and sometimes failed customers. Other firms simply may not be set up to ever implement the change – whether due to the nature of their businesses, or because it's not a cultural fit.","Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers.
Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service.
Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.
The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts.
In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work."

Barbara Massaad's cookbook, Forever Beirut, shares a recipe for meatballs in yoghurt sauce that is served in Lebanon on New Year's Day.

To start the year with a clean slate in Lebanon, the hearty dish of kibbeh labaniyeh (meatballs in a thick mint yoghurt sauce) is served at family tables on New Year's Day. For award-winning cookbook author, food consultant and president of Slow Food Beirut, Barbara Massaad, kibbeh labaniyeh is ""comfort food with a capital C"".

""My kids always make fun of me because I say it 10 times when we're eating it,"" Massaad said from her home in Beirut, as she cracked eggs into a pan of heated yoghurt. ""Kibbeh labaniyeh is white, pure… it's so good. Everything that has to do with dairy is nurturing and delicious.""

Her recipe for kibbeh labaniyeh appears in her 2022 cookbook Forever Beirut, which compiles all the important tabkheh (everyday recipes from family homes) in Lebanon.

""We take the tabkheh very seriously,"" Massaad explained. ""One of the priorities for women in Lebanon is to have the food ready for the kids when they come home from school, even if she works, she will do it early morning or the night before.""

Forever Beirut is dedicated to the victims of the Beirut port explosion of August 2020, when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate improperly stored in the capital's port ignited and blew up the inner city, killing more than 200 people. For Massaad, cooking is an art and a form of expression, so after the explosion she knew she needed to write a cookbook to get through that difficult period. Kibbeh labaniyeh was an obvious choice to add into the collection of recipes.

""It nourishes the soul, you really feel good when you're eating it,"" Massaad said, as she delicately transferred the kibbeh balls into the yoghurt sauce.

Massaad, who spends much of her time in rural Lebanon with local food producers, believes kibbeh labaniyeh may have originated in east Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley where cow's milk is abundant. But there are many different kibbeh dishes throughout the diverse regions of Lebanon, including vegetarian versions and ones that consist of raw meat. Kibbeh balls alone are an integral part of the Lebanese mezze table, almost always on offer at gatherings.

The meatballs for kibbeh labaniyeh are formed from a shell of bulgur that is spiced with allspice, cinnamon, cumin and black pepper and then stuffed with minced meat and pine nuts.

Shaping the balls takes practice – it's an art – and once you form the perfect football-shaped kibbeh that doesn't crack, the satisfaction is immense. Making sure your hands are wet when moulding the balls helps a great deal.

In some Lebanese homes, they order kibbeh labaniyah and place large amounts in the freezer to take out when needed. This means they can make kibbeh labaniyeh in only half an hour; the meatballs can be baked from frozen until the outer layer is slightly crisp.

Using dried mint for the sauce (rather than fresh) adds an extra punch, and Massaad suggests allowing the yoghurt to come to room temperature before cooking it. ""You don't want to shock the yoghurt – [adding it] from the fridge to the cooking pan immediately is a no no,"" she said.

When cooking the yoghurt sauce, it is important to add egg if using cow's milk yoghurt, otherwise the dairy will curdle and become lumpy. As you cook it, Massaad explained, ""You need to thicken it like a sauce – you don't want it to be watery.""

The thick sauce collects on the rice as it is served, and the bulgur shell soaks up the fluffy yoghurt, melding with the stuffing. The dish is surely heavy, but in a wholesome, fulfilling way, preparing you for the year ahead.

Kibbeh Labaniyeh recipe (Kibbeh in Yoghurt Sauce) By Barbara Massaad

Serves 4

Ingredients 12 kibbeh balls (stuffed or left hollow), raw or cooked and frozen (or use homemade Kibbeh Iras (Kibbeh Balls)) 1kg (4 cups) plain, full-fat cow or goat yoghurt, at room temperature for one hour 1 large egg, whisked (only if using cow's milk yoghurt) salt 1½ tbsp cornflour diluted with 120ml (¼ cup) water 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2-3 garlic cloves, minced 1 bunch mint or coriander, leaves finely chopped, or 1 tbsp dried mint, crumbled

Method

Step 1 Prepare your kibbeh balls. If the balls are raw or frozen, you can deep-fry them, bake them at 200C/400F for 5 minutes, or drop them in a pot of boiling water for 2 minutes (remove with a slotted spoon and pierce them in a few places with a toothpick – this will help them hold their shape).

Step 2 Put the yoghurt in a large saucepan and set over medium heat. Add the egg (if using), season with salt and slowly bring to a boil, whisking constantly in the same direction to prevent the yoghurt from curdling (the egg helps with this). As soon as the yoghurt starts to bubble, lower the heat to a gentle simmer and whisk in the diluted cornflour. Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened.

Step 3 Drop the kibbeh balls gently into the hot yoghurt and simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring carefully so they don't break.

Step 4 Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and sauté the garlic just until golden. Mix in the mint or coriander, lower the heat, and cook just until the leaves have wilted but are still green. Gently stir into the yogurt sauce. Serve hot with plain rice or vermicelli rice.

Homemade Kibbeh Iras (Kibbeh Balls) By Barbara Massaad

Makes about 24

Ingredients For the kibbeh shells: 1 small onion, quartered 225g (8oz) lean lamb leg mince or beef sirloin mince ½ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (optional) ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper ½ tsp salt ice cubes 400g (2½ cups) fine brown bulgur For the stuffing: 1 tbsp clarified butter or butter 35g (¼ cup) pine nuts 1 small onion, finely chopped 250g (9oz) coarsely minced lamb or beef with 20% fat ¼ tsp salt ¼ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground cumin (optional) ½ tbsp pomegranate molasses (optional) vegetable oil, for deep-frying

Method

Step 1 To make the kibbeh shell mixture, very finely chop the onion in a food processor. Add the meat, along with the spices and salt and a couple of ice cubes. Blend until you have a smooth, creamy paste.

Step 2 Wash and drain the bulgur well, then add it to the meat mixture. Pulse for 1 minute to combine. Transfer to a mixing bowl.

Step 3 Prepare a small bowl of ice water. Dipping your hands into the ice water periodically to prevent sticking, knead the mixture for a few minutes until smooth and uniform. Set the bowl of water aside for later.

Step 4 To make the stuffing, melt ½ tbsp of the clarified butter in a frying pan. Sauté the pine nuts until golden brown, watching carefully so they don't burn. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on paper towels to drain.

Step 5 Add the rest of the clarified butter to the pan and sauté the onion until translucent. Stir in the meat, salt, spices and pomegranate molasses, if using, and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Once cooked, stir in the fried pine nuts and set aside.

Step 6 Moistening your hands with the cold water, divide the shell mixture into 24 even balls each about the size of a walnut. Place one ball in your hand. Poke a hole in the ball using the index finger of your other hand and rotate your finger to make a hollow. The walls of the shell should be an even 1cm (½in) thick and the length of about 8cm (3in). Be careful not pierce the bottom or sides of the shell.

Step 7 Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the stuffing into the hollow and pinch the opening together with moistened fingers to seal the opening, forming the kibbeh into a football shape (like a rugby ball). Repeat with the remaining shell mixture and stuffing. At this stage, you can freeze the kibbeh balls. Space them out on a tray to freeze, then transfer to re-sealable containers or bags.

Step 8 If you're using them immediately, pour vegetable oil into a large pot or deep fryer to a depth of 5cm (2in). Heat until the oil reaches a temperature of 180C (350F), or until small bubbles gather around a small piece of bread dropped into the oil. Working in batches, deep fry the kibbeh for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a colander to drain the excess oil. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Tip You can easily double this recipe to make a bigger batch and keep the kibbeh frozen.

Moki Cherry blended work and life, embodying a free-spirited 1970s vision – and her legacy lives on. Her daughter, the singer-songwriter Neneh Cherry, and her granddaughter Naima Karlsson recall her life and work.

In a photograph from 1967, the Swedish artist Moki Cherry lies on a rug on the floor in her home, staring into the distance, sporting a feather-trimmed jacket and a pixie haircut. She holds a book open on a page seemingly about art. Behind her, the walls are entirely draped in decorated textiles covered in colourful shapes and patterns – the ambiguous body parts and abstract swirling lines of these pieces have since become known as the artist's signature style. In front of her is her young daughter, the now multi-award-winning singer-songwriter Neneh Cherry, sitting on a stool and pointing in the direction Moki is staring.

More like this:

This image encapsulates Moki as an artist, and how Neneh perceives her mother. ""She was self-taught but also incredibly studious,"" the now 59-year-old Neneh tells the BBC over the phone, reflecting on her childhood. Neneh notes that Moki was always working to improve her practice. ""She was always present, but there was a kind of intensity to it that was so beautiful,"" she says. ""I remember her working with fabrics on the floor. I always think of how her head was turned down on whatever area she was working on.""

Moki was an interdisciplinary artist born in 1943 in Norrbotten, a region ​​in the far northeast of Sweden. She created art from the 1960s until she died in 2009, exploring various mediums, including tapestry, fashion, painting, collage and ceramics. Despite her name being relatively unknown throughout her life, ""Moki's work is more well-known now,"" says Elisabeth Millqvist, director of Moderna Museet in Malmö, Sweden, where Moki Cherry: A Journey Eternal, the most extensive retrospective of her art, is on show until March 2024.

A resurgence of interest in tapestry and the acceptance of it as an art form have resulted in Moki and her work gaining more recognition

Moki's creations graced everything from musician costumes to her family's everyday clothes, to album covers and the backdrop of music concerts, most notably those of her partner, the American jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, who she met in the mid-1960s and collaborated with for decades. ""Her work is very much organic in how it can be presented,"" adds Andreas Nilsson, who co-curated the show in Malmö with Millqvist. ""She made it not only to present it in a white-cube gallery as we are doing here, but also for concerts, clothes and theatre stages.""

A resurgence of interest in tapestry and the acceptance of it as an art form have resulted in Moki and her work, which many have deemed ahead of its time, gaining more recognition. It has been shown across the globe, including at Moki Cherry: Here and Now at London's Institute of Contemporary Art last summer, which was co-curated by Naima Karlsson, Moki's granddaughter. ""So many contemporary artists are using textiles and ceramics, which is great, but it's not that long ago that galleries did not take that kind of work seriously, and saw it as women's hobbies,"" 40-year-old Karlsson, who administers Moki's estate, tells the BBC. ""I think she stood by the materials she was interested in but struggled to find many people keen on showing that in galleries."" Other solo exhibitions of Moki Cherry's work have taken place at Galleri Nicolai Wallner in Copenhagen, and Argos in Brussels in 2022, and at Corbett vs Dempsey in Chicago in 2021.

The stage as home

Part of what stands out about Moki as an artist is what she and her work stood for, and how she balanced various aspects of her existence. She lived by a simple motto: ""The stage as home, and the home as a stage,"" which highlights not only how she saw her life as very much intertwined with her practice but also how she navigated motherhood in the 1960s and 70s, bringing up her two children Neneh and Eagle-Eye.

According to curators Millqvist and Nilsson, the rise of women's rights in the US in the 1960s and 70s, where Moki and her partner Don were living at the time (as well as in Sweden), meant working women were becoming increasingly accepted. Gender roles in the home were still prevalent, though Moki challenged these conventions through her art. ""She looked for a way to make the domestic situation an artistic one, and household chores into artworks,"" says Millqvist, noting that Moki and Don's home often became an extension of their practice and a creative hub where she and Don invited children and artists from the community to make things.

She was very interested in rebuilding the idea of what home meant in a soulful way – Neneh Cherry

Neneh also recalls how Moki often set up her studio space to accommodate work and motherhood. ""On some tables, there could be an artwork she was working on depending on what she was doing, whether it was fabric or on paper or whatever, and then in the corner, there would be a stack of pillowcases she was ironing,"" Neneh says. ""There was a duality Moki fought with: the dream of wanting a home that functioned but also finding the time to do her work."" That said, Neneh notes that her mother appeared to embrace some elements of traditional systems, which Neneh suggests came from Moki valuing aspects of her Swedish upbringing, resulting in her enjoying activities such as ""the slow cooking process of making food"".

But, alongside subverting ideas of motherhood, Moki made works unique to her personality and interests, especially nature and Buddhism. ""I often think about walking down the street with my mother where we used to live in New York,"" Neneh says. ""There was some kind of weird weed growing in a crack in the concrete, and she was like, 'Wow, look at that. Look at how powerful nature is."" Consequently, Moki's work often melds the human figure, various animals and the environment to a point where it's difficult to decipher one aspect of the piece from another. ""It's like those images that you turn upside down and see different shapes,"" Millqvist says. ""Depending on how you look at it, it could be the sea or a hand.""

The home as stage

Spiritual and historical symbols are also prevalent in Moki's work. ""One of the most apparent ones is her use of snakes, which appear in all different areas of her work,"" Karlsson explains. ""Snakes are a prominent and ancient symbol in many different places [across the globe] that can signify something connected to nature or women's spirituality."" Karlsson particularly points out the ouroboros (or uroboros), an ancient symbol depicting a snake eating its own tail, ""which can represent the ongoing continuation of life and death,"" Karlsson explains. Hands also consistently appear in Moki's work, which could relate to the use of mudra (or hand positions) in Buddhism, which Moki practised. In Buddhist art, different hand positions represent particular meanings. Her piece Spirit, 1976 shows green hands going up each side of her textile appliqué with fingers in certain gestures, which could be interpreted as specific mudras depending on how the viewer perceives the fingers.

Both musicians, Neneh and Karlsson note that Moki instilled a sense of curiosity about the world and a need for creativity in her family. ""She had no interest in wanting to be a stereotypical domestic person. But at the same time, she was very interested in rebuilding the idea of what home meant in a soulful way,"" says Neneh, who started her music career in London in the early 1980s, where she performed in punk and post-punk bands, including The Slits and the experimental Rip Rig + Panic. ""I definitely feel I've continued with that,"" Neneh says of Moki's approach to both art and homelife. Karlsson, Neneh's daughter, incorporates photography, drawing, text and music in her practice. Neneh's other two children – with record producer husband Cameron McVey – Mabel and Tyson McVey, are also musicians, and Mabel won the Best British female solo artist award in 2020. As Neneh puts it: ""My kids grew up in the continuation of that environment, and are now making their own versions of that, and it's very powerful.""

By Kit Yates Features correspondent

Special offers on the produce we buy are one of the ways linear thinking breaks down in the real world (Credit: Getty Images)

As we grow up we are trained to think about things in a linear way. But it can leave us ill-equipped in our complex, fast moving modern world, harm our finances and even cause problems with artificial intelligence.

This is how the problem often starts: ""If Jane pays £5 for 10 grapefruits, how many grapefruits does she get for £50?""

Answering the question, it transpires that the idealised world of mathematics is the only place you can buy 100 grapefruits and no-one bats an eyelid.

To find the answer to the question, many of us have been conditioned to use linear reasoning to assume that for 10 times as much money, Jane gets herself 10 times as many grapefruits.

The word ""linear"" describes a special relationship between two variables – an input and an output. If a relationship is linear, a change in one quantity by a fixed amount will always produce a fixed change in the other quantity. This is a good model for all sorts of real-world relationships. With a fixed exchange-rate, a pound Sterling might be worth two New Zealand dollars, £10 would be worth NZ$20 and £100 would be worth NZ$200. This is a special type of linear relationship. As you increase the pounds you want to exchange, the number of dollars you get back increases in direct proportion – if I double the input I also double the output.

If I can buy three chocolate bars for £2, then surely, I can buy six chocolate bars for £4. The number of bars I can purchase scales linearly with the money I'm prepared to spend. Linearity assumes there are no three-for-two offers on the table. (And of course, in reality exchange rates vary wildly with the changing fortunes of the financial market.)

Not all linear relationships are in direct proportion though. To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit you need to multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8 and add 32. Doubling the input doesn't double the output in this relationship, but because it is linear a fixed change in the input always corresponds to a fixed change in the output. A rise of 5C is always a rise of 9F no matter what temperature you start from. These relationships can be represented as straight lines, which is why we call them linear.

Perhaps I have laboured the point a little about these linear relationships, especially since linearity is such a familiar idea. But herein lies the problem: we are so familiar with the concept of linearity that we impose our linear frame of reference on data we observe in the real world.

This is linearity bias in its simplest form. As I explore in my new book How to Expect the Unexpected, many systems do not obey these simple linear relationships. For example, if I leave money in my bank account or forget to pay off a debt then that sum of money will grow non-linearly (specifically it will grow exponentially) – interest accruing on the interest. The more money I have (or owe) the faster it will grow. Because many of us are subject to linearity bias we underestimate how quickly these sums of money will grow, which makes saving for the future seem less attractive, but also makes taking on debt seem more attractive. Individuals with higher levels of linearity bias have been found to have higher debt-to-income ratios (the amount of debt they take on relative to their income).

Pseudo-linearity

It seems that the most important explanation for our over-reliance on linearity comes from the mathematics classroom itself. Investigations into the origins of this bias have shown that our propensity to assume linearity is present long before we leave school. These studies pose students questions in which linearity is not the right tool to use in order to see how they respond. These so-called pseudo-linearity problems might take the form:

""Laura is a sprinter. Her best time to run 100m (328ft) is 13 seconds, how long will it take her to run 1km (3,280ft)?""

It is not possible to ascertain the correct answer from the information in the problem. However, most students still reach for the linear solution, without any concern for the unrealistic nature of their underlying assumptions. They scale up the time to run 100m by a factor of 10, to account for the distance being 10 times longer, giving a time of 130 seconds to run 1km. Clearly this can only ever be a lower bound on the true answer since it neglects to take into account the fact that no athlete can sustain their best 100m pace over the course of 1km. Indeed, the linear answer would see Laura utterly destroying the world record for running 1km – two minutes and 11 seconds.

To propose this should hold true of every phenomenon in our world would be to deny the existence and the magic of emergent phenomena

A compounding factor is the lack of acknowledgement in maths classes that the real world is usually not as simple as a maths problem. Even artificial intelligence is picking up these mistakes: ChatGPT, a chatbot designed to mimic human interactions, has learned these same biases. When I asked it ""It takes three towels three hours to dry on the line, how long does it take nine towels to dry?"" it responded with the answer ""nine hours"" reasoning that if you triple the number of towels, you triple the amount of time it takes for them to dry. Really, if your drying line is long enough, it shouldn't take any longer for nine towels to dry in parallel than three.

A non-linear world

I'm baking with the kids and we want to make twice as many cupcakes as the recipe suggests then we need to use twice as much of each of the ingredients. The ingredients combine linearly to make twice as much mixture. This seems only right. But to propose this should hold true of every phenomenon in our world would be to deny the existence and the magic of emergent phenomena – for example, that no single molecule of H20 is wet or the unique fractals that snowflakes form, not by adding individual crystals together, but as one complex superstructure. Even our own lives are so much more than the simple sum of atoms and molecules which comprise our physical embodiments.

Although most of the time we are unaware of them, many of the most important relationships that we experience every day are nonlinear. But we have the idea of linearity drilled into us so early on and so often that sometimes we forget that other relationships can even exist. Our overfamiliarity with linear relationships means that, when something occurs that is nonlinear, it can catch us off-guard and confound our expectations.

By making the implicit assumption that inputs scale linearly with outputs, we are liable to find that our predictions can be way off the mark and that our plans can blow up in our faces. We live in a nonlinear world, but we are so used to thinking in straight lines that we often don't even notice it.

Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded.

Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come.

February: TikTok bans go global

Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly.

In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.

In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions.

In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections.

March and May: Three US banks fail

The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"".

By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future.

May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America

Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape.

Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing.

The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter.

Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis.

The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.

May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap

There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap.

It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom.

July: Twitter becomes X

In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next.

Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.

Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.

Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content.

September: Rupert Murdoch steps down

After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair.

In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's.

October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial

Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.

Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.

One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more.

October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard

Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.

In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal.

November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection

Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning.

Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand.

December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court

At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward.

If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation.

By Lily Radziemski Features correspondent

While women were barred from owning businesses in 19th Century France, three widows, who were exempt from the rule, created some of Champagne's most lauded empires.

As we get ready to pop the cork for a brand-new year, we've brought back one of our favourite BBC Travel stories, one that reminds us of how several of France's biggest Champagne innovations came to be: through the ingenuity of a few independent and creative women.

On the outskirts of the north-eastern French city of Reims, winding roads converge near a gated chateau. Cars line a roundabout enclosed by sprawling fields. The air is still, and it's calm. The real action is happening almost 20m underground.

Carving through this underworld are more than 200km of cellars, with millions of Champagne bottles lining chalky rock walls, unlabelled and marked with the words ""I was here"" by tourists in the dust covering them. Some are upside-down, in chains, glowing in the dim light of the cellars against the backdrop of tunnels that seemingly lead to nowhere. Others are stacked in small caves guarded by wrought iron gates. This is ground zero of the world's Champagne market.

And, historically in the caves, widows ruled.

Some of the biggest innovations of Champagne came down to the ingenuity of several women. In the 19th Century, the Napoleonic Code restricted women from owning businesses in France without permission from a husband or father. However, widows were exempt from the rule, creating a loophole for Barbe-Nicole Clicquot-Ponsardin, Louise Pommery and Lily Bollinger – among others – to turn vineyards into empires and ultimately transform the Champagne industry, permanently changing how it's made and marketed.

In 1798, Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin married François Clicquot, who then ran his family's small textile and wine business, originally called Clicquot-Muiron et Fils in Reims. It turned into a financial disaster. When Clicquot died in 1805, leaving her widowed at 27 years old, she made the unconventional choice to take over the company.

""It was a very unusual decision for a woman of her class,"" said Tilar Mazzeo, cultural historian and author of The Widow Clicquot. ""It would have been extremely unusual for her to have a business, because she didn't need to… She could have spent her life in drawing rooms and as a society hostess.""

Desperately in need of money for the business, she asked her father-in-law for today's equivalent of about €835,000.

""Amazingly, her father-in-law said yes,"" Mazzeo explained, ""which I always think must say something really important about who he thought she was, and what he thought she was capable of as a woman with no business background.""

The 'veuve' suggested a certain kind of respectability to the beverage

From the beginning, Barbe-Nicole used her widowed status as a marketing tool, yielding positive results. The Champagne house became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin – the French word veuve translates into ""widow"".

""The 'veuve' suggested a certain kind of respectability to the beverage… some of these beverages had gotten associated with the debauchery and wild parties of the royal courts of old,"" explained Kolleen M Guy, author of When Champagne Became French: Wine and the Making of a National Identity and chair, Division of Arts and Humanities at Duke Kunshan University in Jiansu, China.

Tagging ""veuve"" onto a bottle brought clout, and other Champagne producers – such as Veuve Binet and Veuve Loche – soon followed suit.

""The companies that didn't have a widow at the head of the household would create kind of off-brands, like a veuve off-brand, so they could try to capture this trend,"" Guy said.

Despite Barbe-Nicole completing a four-year apprenticeship with a local winemaker to better learn how to make the business grow, it was once again on the brink of collapse in the early 19th Century. She secured another €835,000 from her father-in-law to salvage it. However, doing this during the Napoleonic Wars in continental Europe wouldn't be easy, as border closures made it difficult to move product around.

But by 1814, Barbe-Nicole knew that she was running out of options. Faced with bankruptcy, she turned to a new market: Russia. While Russia's border was still closed towards the end of the Napoleonic wars, she decided to run the blockade.

""She made this huge gamble, where she knew that if she could get her product into Russia before Jean-Remy Moët, who was her arch-rival, she would be able to capture some market share,"" Mazzeo said. ""Otherwise, once the border was legally open, Moët's Champagne was going to arrive, and Moët would continue to be the dominant player in that very important Russian export market.""

So, Barbe-Nicole smuggled thousands of bottles across the border. The risks were high as it was late in the season and the heat could ruin the Champagne. And if caught, the bottles would be confiscated, contributing to more financial ruin. Fortunately, the Champagne arrived in perfect condition and took the market by storm.

""In 90 days, she went from being an unknown player [in Russia] to being 'The Widow',"" Mazzeo said.

With the demand came a need to increase production fast. The process of removing dead yeast cells from the bottom of bottles – a necessary step in Champagne-making following the aging and fermentation process – was tedious and damaging to the quality. But Barbe-Nicole had a better idea.

""She basically said to her winemakers, 'take my kitchen table down to the cellar – I want you to poke some holes in it and let's just turn these [bottles] upside-down. Don't you think that would be a better way of getting the yeast out? The yeast would settle in the neck of the bottle, we could pop it out, that would be faster, wouldn't it?',"" Mazzeo recounted. ""Everybody said 'no, no no, we can't do it that way'."" But they acquiesced.

It worked. That technique is became known as ""riddling"" (to make holes in something) and is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today.

The second widow to revolutionise the industry was Louise Pommery. Born in 1819, Pommery entered into the Champagne scene towards the end of Clicquot's life. When she was young, her mother sent her to school in England – an unusual move that would later play to her advantage.

""She wasn't just taught how to sew,"" said Prince Alain de Polignac, the great-great-grandson of Louise Pommery. ""[Her mother] gave her an education, which was unusual for a bourgeoise girl of that time.""

After her studies, she married Alexandre Pommery, who partnered with Narcisse Greno in 1856 to build up his existing Champagne house, creating Pommery et Greno. In 1858, Alexandre died. For Louise Pommery, the next move was clear. Eight days after his death, she stepped in to take over.

""Destiny swooped in, and Madame Pommery was ready,"" said de Polignac. ""She had a 15-year-old son and a baby in her arms, and instead of returning to her mother's home, she decided to take [the Champagne house] over.""

Lily Radziemski

While Clicquot might have captured Russia, Pommery was determined to own the English market.

At the time, Champagne was painfully sweet – some bottles would have up to 300g of residual sugar compared to the more typical 12 or so grams today – and it was served over ice, sort of like a slushie. As such, the English, who typically had a drier palette, didn't have a taste for it. But Pommery felt that she could make a Champagne that would get them hooked.

Her brut Champagne hit markets in 1874. The style was distinctively dry, fresh and lively. It was perfectly balanced with a light-hearted nose, delicate but assertive.

""The idea was to make a wine that was a lot more fine, with assemblage a lot more subtle, a much longer time in cave…"" de Polignac said. ""This exploded on the English market, because that's what they were waiting for.""

Champagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows. Whereas most Champagne-makers built chateaux after achieving success in business, Pommery did the opposite, building an estate as a means of attracting success.

In the mid-20th Century, Lily Bollinger emerged on the scene.

She took over the Bollinger Champagne house in 1941 when Jacques Bollinger, her husband and the owner of the brand, passed. At the time, women's rights to business ownership were still restricted (it wasn't until 1965 that women were granted full rights to employment, banking and asset management without permission) though widows were still able to circumvent the rules.

""She decided to take over the management – she could have sold the business,"" explained her great nephew, Etienne Bizot.

Bollinger brought her Champagne to the US. For three months, she travelled all over the country carting around her wines, alone. According to Bollinger's official history, she gained such popularity that she was named ""the first lady of France"" by the Chicago American newspaper in 1961.

A few years later, Bollinger released the R.D. (recently disgorged) vintage Champagne, a technique that she innovated by aging the bottle with its lees, the dead yeast and grape skins, for extended periods of time and then removing the sediment from the bottle by hand. The Champagne is still one of the brand's most coveted cuvees today.

""I think what's unusual about the widows is that they [don't] remarry,"" Guy explained. ""In a way, I think they didn't do it because had they remarried, they would have had to turn over some of the business to their husbands… They'd lose their legal status, so in some ways, it was a way to keep their independence.""

The independence and creativity of the three widows paved the way for generations of women to come, and their innovations are immortalised in glass bottles.

""This group of women really changed something – they were pioneers that were very engaged in the key moments [of Champagne-making], and that importance is still represented,"" said Mélanie Tarlant, a twelfth-generation winemaker and member of La Transmission, Femmes en Champagne, a women-led association for Champagne-makers. She makes non-dosé (low sugar-dosed) Champagne, noting that Pommery was the first to pioneer the technique that she still uses today.

""It could have been lost in time.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67818598,Liverpool 4-2 Newcastle: Mohamed Salah scores twice for Premier League leaders,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Salah is the fifth player to score 150 Premier League goals for one club

Mohamed Salah scored twice as Liverpool eventually broke down Newcastle United to open up a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League.

In a relentless and frantic game, fuelled by wicked rain and wind on Merseyside, Liverpool took swing after swing at Newcastle but looked in danger of being held to a third consecutive Anfield draw after a goalless first half.

Salah missed the opening period's best chance when he had a penalty saved but the forward, who will now join Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations, tapped home a cross for the first and then converted a second spot-kick in the closing stages.

His first strike was his 150th Premier League goal for the Reds, but it was cancelled out five minutes later by Alexander Isak, who got in behind the hosts' defence after good work by Anthony Gordon and curled home.

Liverpool pressed hard to go in front again and eventually Curtis Jones gave them the lead before a scuffed Cody Gapko effort from a brilliant Salah pass gave them breathing space.

But back came Newcastle when Sven Botman headed home a corner to make it 3-2 before Salah sent Martin Dubravka - who was heroic throughout - the wrong way to secure the points.

Liverpool won their opening seven Premier League games at Anfield this season but had been held to draws by Manchester United and Arsenal in their previous two home games.

They lead Aston Villa by three points and have a five-point advantage over Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and Arsenal.

Newcastle, who were missing nine first-team players, remain ninth.

Slick Liverpool find a way in chaotic match

From the first whistle the match was dominated by Liverpool, who registered a league-high 18 shots in the first half.

Trent Alexander-Arnold saw an effort deflected wide and hit the post with a wicked volley from an incredibly tight angle, while Darwin Nunez's flicked effort was kept out by Dubravka.

Diaz had a goal disallowed because Nunez strayed marginally offside in the build-up, before Salah's first penalty - powered to Dubravka's left but too central - was saved.

It meant Salah had failed to score four of his past 10 penalties in all competitions but he put it behind him and was brilliant in the second half.

Diaz and Nunez combined to leave the Egypt forward unmarked in the middle to tap home the opener and relieve the growing tension inside Anfield.

The equaliser was a setback - especially after Nunez was twice denied with good chances to make it 2-0 - but Liverpool's quality and intricate forward play eventually found a way through Newcastle.

Jones tapped home after a fine Salah pass found Diogo Jota, before the Egyptian brilliantly crossed with the outside of his foot for Gakpo to dribble his effort over the line with the bottom of his studs.

Salah's second came when Jota was tripped by Dubravka and he showed the strength of his mentality to send the goalkeeper the wrong way and sign off for what could be potentially six weeks with his country.

The victory means Liverpool are unbeaten in 22 games at Anfield, and have now only lost one of their past 52 home games in the Premier League.

""It was a sensational game from my team,"" said Klopp. ""We started extremely lively. Everyone saw Dubravka's performance, and we ourselves made sure the score didn't get too clear.

""Super game. I loved so many aspects of the game, bar the goals we conceded. Counter-pressing-wise, it was for football schools. They have to watch that, take it and keep it. It was everything good.""

Injury-ravaged Newcastle battle but lack options

Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has had to deal with a torrid run of injuries during the busiest part of the season and he came into this game with club captain Kieran Trippier also absent with a groin injury.

They weathered the early storm well and grew into the game, with Dan Burn's header disallowed because Isak was inches offside earlier in the move.

The Sweden striker's finish for the equaliser was a moment of clinical proficiency and came from their first shot on target - and only their second overall in the game.

Dubravka was in inspired form, using all parts of his body to keep Liverpool out, but he could do very little about Jones and Gapko's goals.

Those goals came around the time a manager may have been thinking of turning to his bench for fresh legs, so Howe may well be lamenting the lack of options available to him.

While Newcastle can point to their injuries, Howe will also know his side have only earned five points away from St James' Park so far this season and have only kept one clean sheet in their past 19 away games.

They play just three games in January - which could be four if they beat local rivals Sunderland in the FA Cup third round on Saturday - and Howe will hope the winter break allows him to get players fit as they look to qualify for Europe again.

""We're battling to get our best levels back,"" Howe told BBC Sport. ""The effort and determination was there. As long as we continue to see that we'll be fine.

""The most important thing is we're fighting. We're missing a lot of players, we've had a lot of tough fixtures in a congested December.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/darts/67859195,Luke Littler v Rob Cross: Teenager confident of winning PDC World Darts Championship,['Author not found'],"For Luke Littler, the darts-mad 16-year-old who first played on a magnetic board as a toddler, just winning one match at the PDC World Championship was a historic achievement.

But with each passing win he keeps setting his heights ever higher.

And after sweeping past Brendan Dolan to set up a semi-final against Rob Cross on Tuesday, Littler now has his eyes on the biggest prize of all.

""It's going to take a lot to stop me,"" he said.

""It feels unbelievable. I never thought I would have got to the semis on my debut year.

""It's crazy watching myself at 18 months or two years old in a nappy, but it has all paid off.

""One day we went to a shop with my parents and I pointed to a magnetic dartboard because they look similar. The rest is history.""

Littler's rise has been meteoric. The Alexandra Palace fans were taunting him with chants of ""you've got school in the morning"" during his first-round win over Christian Kist on 20 December, when he became the youngest player to win a match at the tournament.

Less than two weeks later he has banked £100,000 in prize money, is being asked for selfies everywhere he goes and watching Premier League matches in the executive box.

""I've been to an Arsenal game, I went to a Tottenham game - people come up to me. I don't know who these people are but they know me,"" said Littler. ""It is a good feeling and I will always take a picture with anyone.

""I was in (Tottenham midfielder) James Maddison's box. It was good to meet him, get a few pictures and meet his family. It was really nice.""

Standing between Littler and a place in the final is world number eight Cross, who made history himself by becoming the first player to fight back from 4-0 to beat Chris Dobey 5-4 in his quarter-final.

Cross won the World Championship on his debut in 2018 and thinks Littler has similar momentum behind him now.

""Everyone loves an underdog story,"" Cross said. ""It took a bit of pressure off me winning it first time as well.

""He's fantastic and he deserves all the luck in the world - he is a nice young boy. Tomorrow we play darts, though, and I have to go down to business.""

The other semi-final is also an all-England affair as Scott Williams faces third seed Luke Humphries.

Williams shocked Dutchman and three-time winner Michael van Gerwen 5-3 to reach the last four for the first time in just his second appearance at the World Championships.

Humphries, who won three major titles in 2023 and is the highest-ranked player left in the competition, is also in the last four at Alexandra Palace for the first time after breezing past Dave Chisnall 5-1.","For Luke Littler, the darts-mad 16-year-old who first played on a magnetic board as a toddler, just winning one match at the PDC World Championship was a historic achievement.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67722978,January transfer window: Who could be on the move?,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

It is that time of the year again.

After months of speculation about who could go where, the January transfer window is now open and some of those rumours could soon become reality.

We've gathered some of the most talked about potential moves that could happen in the next few weeks.

Kalvin Phillips (Manchester City)

Linked with: Newcastle, Juventus

Kalvin Phillips scored his first goal for Manchester City when they beat Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on 13 December, but it is unlikely to be enough to prolong his stay at Etihad Stadium.

Newcastle have been strongly linked with a move for the England midfielder, while a transfer overseas could be an option with Italian giants Juventus also reported as a possible destination.

Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)

Linked with: Borussia Dortmund

It has long been clear Jadon Sancho's future lies away from Old Trafford, with the forward having been exiled from the first team after a fall out with Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag.

His former club Borussia Dortmund have been mooted as a possible destination but wages appear to be the main stumbling block.

Team-mate Donny van de Beek joined Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt when the window opened on 1 January.

The 26-year-old will join for the rest of the season, with an option to turn the transfer into a permanent deal.

Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal)

Linked with: Chelsea, Newcastle

England international Aaron Ramsdale lost his Arsenal place to David Raya in September, and with a European Championship next summer, may seek a January move to ensure regular first-team football.

Chelsea and Newcastle have both been linked with a move for Ramsdale.

Conor Gallagher (Chelsea)

Linked with: Tottenham

Conor Gallagher has been a first-time regular at Chelsea this season and even captained the side on a number of occasions, which makes it somewhat surprising that he could be heading elsewhere in January.

The Blues are said to be needing to balance the books after some big spending over the past 18 months and Gallagher could be sacrificed to help fund that.

The England midfielder is believed to be available for around £50m and has been linked with a switch to Chelsea's London rivals Tottenham. external-link

Ivan Toney (Brentford)

Linked with: Arsenal

Arsenal faltered in their title challenge on 28 December when they lost 2-0 at home to West Ham - a game that highlighted a need for someone to put away the many chances they created. Mikel Arteta's side had 30 efforts on goal with only eight on target.

Brentford striker Ivan Toney has long been rumoured to be a priority January signing to bolster Arsenal's attack.

Toney is still serving his eight-month ban from football for breaching the Football Association's betting rules but is set to return on 17 January.

Joao Palhinha (Fulham)

Linked with: Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Liverpool

Fulham attempted to warn off clubs interested in midfielder Joao Palhinha by giving him a new contract in September, but their resolve looks set to be tested in January.

Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Liverpool have all been linked with a move for the Portugal international.

Fulham are determined to not let him leave on the cheap and are believed to be wanting around £60m for the player. external-link

Thomas Partey (Arsenal)

Linked with: Juventus

Injuries have limited Thomas Partey's appearances at Arsenal this season and with Mikel Arteta believed to be needing to sell players to fund arrivals in January, the midfielder could make way.

The 30-year-old is back in training after a muscle problem kept him out for two months and he has been linked with a move external-link to Italian giants Juventus.

Trevoh Chalobah (Chelsea)

Linked with: Crystal Palace, Bayern Munich, Roma

Like Conor Gallagher, Trevoh Chalobah may have to leave Chelsea in January to help them balance the books.

The defender has not played for the Blues all season after suffering a thigh injury during pre-season.

A move abroad seems likely for Chalobah, with Bayern Munich and Roma reportedly interested, external-link although so too are Crystal Palace.

Emile Smith Rowe (Arsenal)

Linked with: Aston Villa

The England midfielder has recently returned for Arsenal from injury but could move in January if Mikel Arteta needs to move things around to bolster his squad.

Aston Villa have been linked in a potential player-plus-cash deal, external-link with fellow Douglas Luiz moving the other way.

Raphael Varane (Manchester United)

Linked with: Real Madrid, Bayern Munich

The defender is out of contract at the end of the season, and so Manchester United could be tempted to cash in during January.

The 30-year-old France international has been linked with a return to Real Madrid, external-link but Bayern Munich are also said to have entered the race to sign him.

A move may depend on Manchester United's injury list, with a number of their defenders sidelined.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/67855066,"NFL Week 17 results & review: Ravens, 49ers claim top seeds, Eagles upset at home",['Author not found'],"NFL 2023 regular season Dates: 7 September 2023-7 January 2024 BBC coverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website every Sunday.

The road to the Super Bowl will go through Baltimore and San Francisco after the Ravens and 49ers secured the two top seeds in the AFC and NFC, and home advantage in the play-offs.

The Ravens look like the unstoppable force in the NFL after hammering the Miami Dolphins 56-19 in the big game of the New Year's Eve schedule to claim top spot in the AFC, with Lamar Jackson again showcasing his most valuable player (MVP) claims.

San Francisco's 27-10 win over the Washington Commanders gave them the number one seed in the NFC after the Philadelphia Eagles suffered a huge upset defeat at home to the lowly Arizona Cardinals.

The Buffalo Bills continued their play-off push with a 27-21 victory over the New England Patriots while the Kansas City Chiefs won their division for the eighth year running.

Rampant Ravens destroy Dolphins

Lamar Jackson could well be the NFL MVP for a second time

Ravens quarterback Jackson threw five touchdown passes as Baltimore won a sixth game in a row to claim top spot in the AFC in style.

Jackson may now sit out the final game of the season next week with his job done, as the Ravens will have home advantage throughout the play-offs and also a first-round bye after dominating another play-off side.

It's the second-most points the Ravens have ever scored in a game in the NFL - just behind the 59 Jackson also engineered in his 2019 MVP season, which also, ironically, came against Miami.

""I don't know if I've seen a more impressive performance in a game,"" Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said of Jackson. ""I'm not sure I've seen a more impressive performance in a season to date.""

While the Ravens are firmly the team to beat, the Dolphins have work to do despite already being in the play-offs, as they host the Buffalo Bills next week with the AFC East title, and crucially a home play-off game, on the line.

Shock Eagles loss hands NFC top spot to 49ers

Deebo Samuel celebrates his touchdown for the San Francisco 49ers

The 49ers responded to their brutal loss to the Ravens with a comfortable win in Washington, then watched on as a dramatic late Arizona Cardinals victory in Philadelphia meant San Francisco locked up the top seed and play-off bye with a week to spare.

""Thank you, Cardinals,"" said 49ers linebacker Fred Warner. ""The fact that we were able to get it with one game left in the season is big.""

Few gave the 3-12 Cardinals any hope in Philadelphia, but James Conner's late touchdown run gave them a 35-31 victory that continued the Eagles' slump from 10-1 at the start of December to 11-5 with one game left to play.

The Eagles tumbled from second to fifth in the NFC play-offs standings, leaving the Dallas Cowboys in pole position to win the NFC East division as Philadelphia continued to struggle on both sides of the ball.

""We have to get things fixed,"" said Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. ""And we have to get them fixed fast.""

Chiefs make it eight in a row

Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to an eighth straight AFC West title

Harrison Butker kicked six field goals as the Kansas City Chiefs claimed the AFC West title for the eighth time in a row - with their 25-17 victory over Cincinnati also ending the Bengals' play-off hopes.

The Chiefs' defence was again the catalyst as they locked in the third seed in the AFC, meaning it is likely they will have to go and win in Baltimore to get back to the Super Bowl.

""Now you're in the play-offs it's one game, single elimination - and I think we can play with anybody,"" said Patrick Mahomes, who had a pass dropped for the 40th time this season, the most in the NFL and something the team will need to clean up to stand any chance of defending their title.

Anything is possible in the wide-open AFC South, where the Jacksonville Jaguars lead after a dominant 26-0 victory over the Carolina Panthers and will take back-to-back titles with a win next week.

The Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans both won, though, against the Las Vegas Raiders and Tennessee Titans respectively, to join the Jags on 9-7 before their crunch final-day meeting when a division title or wildcard spot could be up for grabs.

Steelers stay alive - Rams back in the post-season

The Los Angeles Rams are back in the play-offs after missing out last season

The Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks 30-23 to not only ensure head coach Mike Tomlin made it 17 straight seasons with a winning record but also keep their play-off hopes alive, while the Seahawks will need a lot of help to sneak in.

The Los Angeles Rams, the Super Bowl champions in 2022, are back in the play-offs after beating the New York Giants 26-25, but the Denver Broncos were eliminated despite beating the Los Angeles Chargers 16-9.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers still lead the NFC South but only on a tie-breaker after losing 23-13 to divisional rivals the New Orleans Saints, while the Atlanta Falcons are also still alive despite losing 37-17 at the Chicago Bears.

The Green Bay Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 33-10 in the primetime game and for the second year running they will play the final game of the season needing a win to book their play-off spot, in what will be a dramatic final Sunday of the campaign.","The road to the Super Bowl will go through Baltimore and San Francisco after the Ravens and 49ers secured the two top seeds in the AFC and NFC, and home advantage in the play-offs.

United Rugby Championship - Connacht v Munster Connacht (3) 22 Try: Aungier Con: Hanrahan Pens: Hanrahan 5 Munster (6) 9 Pens: Butler 3

Connacht ran out 22-9 winners over Irish interprovincial rivals Munster in their URC game in Galway to end a run of five defeats in all competitions.

The New Year's Day encounter was played in conditions which were not conducive to running rugby at the Sportsground.

JJ Hanrahan kicked five penalties to Tony Butler's three, with replacement Jack Aungier's late try, converted by Hanrahan, putting the seal on the win.

Munster are without a win in four games after Monday's hard-fought contest.

After a promising start to the season, Connacht's dip in form had seen them fall out of the top 10 in the URC table but their first victory since 18 November and their third in successive seasons over Munster on their home patch will come as a major boost.

Already ravaged by injuries, Munster were forced into a couple of late changes with Eoghan Clarke and Fineen Wycherley being ruled out. Scott Buckley and Jack O'Donoghue came into the starting side and Gavin Coombes switched to the second row.

In a game played in wet and windy conditions, Munster were quickest out of the blocks and looked to have secured an early score when Coombes charged down Caolin Blade's attempt to clear his lines with a kick from the ruck and the ball fell kindly for the second row who chased it past the try line and touched down.

Coombes' effort was chalked off however when the replay showed that his knee was in touch when he made downward contact with the ball.

The hosts lost Cathal Forde to a head injury soon after, fly-half Jack Carty being introduced as his replacement and Hanrahan slotting into midfield.

Play had only resumed for one minute when Munster prop Oli Jager was also forced off the field through injury, John Ryan coming off the bench to enter the fray.

Hanrahan got the scoring underway with a penalty from close range after Ryan was penalised for not supporting his body weight.

Butler responded with a straightforward kick from in front of the posts.

In a scrappy first half, the visitors had the better of territory and possession and were rewarded for their superiority when Butler split the posts with his second penalty.

With a minute remaining of the opening period, the westerners suffered another setback when Byron Ralston was shown a yellow card for an illegal challenge on O'Donoghue.

The number eight was stretchered off with a knee injury, adding further to Graham Rowntree's side's multitude of injury woes.

Connacht enjoyed the advantage of the wind behind them after the restart and drew level courtesy of Hanrahan's successful kick at the posts.

The return of Ralston restored Pete Wilkins's side to their full quota of 15 players and the close nature of the match continued as Butler and Hanrahan traded further penalties.

Blade became the latest player to leave the field with a head injury, then Hanrahan was again accurate from the tee to establish a three-point lead for the home side with 13 minutes left on the clock.

The Connacht centre brought his tally to five penalties with a well executed kick from the halfway line to extend the gap between the teams to six but his 100% record with the boot was marred as he was off-target with his sixth shot at the posts.

That miss proved inconsequential however as a throw from a line-out flew over everyone and into the hands of Dylan Tierney-Martin, but the ball found its way to Aungier, who powered over to the delight of the home support in the 77th minute.

Connacht recover then from their one-point loss to Ulster before Christmas while for Munster it is a second reverse of the festive period following last week's narrow defeat by Leinster.

Connacht: Hansen; Ralston, Forde, Aki, Bolton; Hanrahan, Blade (capt); Dooley, Heffernan, Bealham; Murray, Joyce; Prendergast, Hurley-Langton, Butler

Australia reached the knockout stage for the first time after losing in the group stage last year

Great Britain missed out on the United Cup quarter-finals as Australia qualified from Group C with a 2-1 victory over the United States.

Hosts Australia reached the last eight asStorm Hunter and Matt Ebden beat Jessica Pegula and Rajeev Ram in a mixed-doubles decider.

Earlier, Pegula beat Ajla Tomljanovic to level after Australia's Alex de Minaur beat Taylor Fritz.

Australia's win meant GB were edged out, finishing third in a tight group.

All three nations won one and lost one of their two ties in Perth, as well as each finishing tied on three match wins and three losses.

That meant the number of sets won was used to decide who progressed to the quarter-finals and Britain, who made a winning start against Australia before losing to the United States, missed out.

The Americans, who are the defending champions, must wait to see if they qualify as one of the best group runners-up.

The winners of six groups go into the last eight and will be joined by the best runner-ups in each of the host cities - Sydney and Perth.

Australia and Poland, who finished as Group A winners, are the first through in the 18-nation event which is a mixed-gender team format and offers $10m (£7.85m) in prize money.

Top seeds Poland, led by women's world number one Iga Swiatek, secured their place in the quarter-finals on Monday with a 2-1 win over Spain.

Four-time major champion Swiatek won 6-2 6-1 against Sara Sorribes Tormo in Perth before partnering Hubert Hurkacz to thrash Sorribes Tormo and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-0 6-0 in the mixed doubles decider.

In Group D, France won 2-1 against Germany as Caroline Garcia and Edouard Roger-Vasselin saved match points before beating Angelique Kerber and Alexander Zverev 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 12-10.

France could win the group if they beat Italy on Wednesday.

In Group B, Norway gave themselves hope of qualifying as two-time major finalist Casper Ruud earned a pair of wins in a 2-1 victory over Croatia in Sydney.","Last updated on .From the section TennisAustralia reached the knockout stage for the first time after losing in the group stage last yearGreat Britain missed out on the United Cup quarter-finals as Australia qualified from Group C with a 2-1 victory over the United States.

Osaka welcomed her daughter Shai in July 2023

New mother Naomi Osaka won the first match of her comeback by beating Tamara Korpatsch in straight sets at the Brisbane International.

The Japanese four-time Grand Slam champion, playing in her first tournament for 15 months, defeated the unseeded German 6-3 7-6 (11-9).

She will face Karolina Pliskova next.

""I'm very proud of myself,"" said Osaka, 26. ""I feel like I played at a pretty good level. I think my opponent played really well as well.""

Osaka moved impressively and hit the ball with familiar power in an accomplished return, but did show a few signs of nerves after opening a 5-3 lead in the second set.

She became a little ragged and had to save two set points before winning a topsy-turvy tie-break 11-9 to set up a second-round meeting with fellow former world number one Pliskova.

Osaka briefly acknowledged the New Year's Day crowd as she walked out to a warm reception, with the rain falling on the roof of the Pat Rafter Arena.

Currently unranked, Osaka made the perfect start and broke Korpatsch to love with some crisp ball striking and a couple of powerful winners.

The world number 84 offered some solid resistance after that, but Osaka broke again to take her second set point with a mighty forehand winner.

The match threatened to turn early in the second set - Osaka made a tentative start after both players returned from the bathroom and she conceded serve with a double fault.

But she restored parity immediately with some thumping winners and moved to the brink of victory by breaking the Korpatsch serve for a 5-3 lead.

It can often prove difficult to close out matches after such a long break from competition, and so it proved as Osaka played a loose service game to concede the advantage.

Korpatsch was growing in confidence and earned two set points. The second, on her own serve, was saved by a powerful Osaka backhand and the Japanese player was then able to get over the line on her own serve.

""She returned pretty well towards the end of the second set. That kind of threw me off a little bit,"" said Osaka.

""I just feel like I was nervous so I wasn't able to close out points the way I wanted to. I think I have to expect that from the first match of the year.""","Last updated on .From the section TennisOsaka welcomed her daughter Shai in July 2023New mother Naomi Osaka won the first match of her comeback by beating Tamara Korpatsch in straight sets at the Brisbane International.
