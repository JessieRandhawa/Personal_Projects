By Graeme Baker BBC News

BBC

Passengers escape as the jet engine continues to spark

First came the shock, as the Airbus A350 carrying 379 people collided with a second plane while landing in Tokyo.

Then came heat and smoke as the jet sped along the runway in flames.

Then survival instinct kicked in, as people scrambled to flee a cabin filling with fumes, knowing that lives depended on the next few seconds.

That all on Japan Airlines flight 516 escaped is extraordinary. Experts say a flawless evacuation and new technology played a large part in their survival.

Watch: Moment plane turns into fireball as it lands on runway

Those on board the second plane, a smaller coastguard aircraft due to deliver aid to quake victims, were not as fortunate. Five were killed and the pilot is seriously injured.

Investigators are piecing together what happened at 17:47 local time (08:47 GMT) at Haneda airport, and why two planes could have been on the runway at the same time.

For now, videos and statements from passengers paint a picture of a few minutes of terror, then disbelief at what they had lived through.

Swede Anton Deibe, 17, a passenger, described the chaos after impact as the Airbus A350 lumbered to a halt on the runway.

""The entire cabin was filled with smoke within minutes,"" he told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.

""The smoke in the cabin stung like hell. It was a hell.

""We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them.

""We had no idea where we were going so we just run out into the field. It was chaos.""

He, his parents and his sister managed to escape the wreckage unharmed.

Smoke fills the cabin as passengers prepare to flee

Satoshi Yamake, a 59-year-old passenger, said he felt the airplane had ""tilted to the side and felt a big bump"" in the initial collision.

Another unnamed passenger described a ""bump, like the aircraft was colliding with something when touching down. I saw a spark outside the window and the cabin was filled with smoke"".

A third reported to Kyodo News he felt ""a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed"".

Snippets of those moments were caught on phones.

Some passengers filmed the red glow from a still sparking engine as the plane came to a halt. Another took footage inside, a miasma of smoke quickly obscuring the camera lens as passengers shouted and cabin crew tried to direct their next moves.

A female passenger said it had been dark on board as the fire intensified after landing.

""It was getting hot inside the plane, and I thought, to be honest, I wouldn't survive,"" she told the Japanese broadcaster NHK.

According to another passenger, the escape plan was made more difficult as only one set of doors were used. ""An announcement said doors in the back and middle could not be opened. So everyone disembarked from the front,"" he said.

Watch: Passengers clamber down emergency slide after plane fire

Images and video show the moment people began to jump down the airliner's inflatable slides - some tumbling in their effort to get away from a now burning cabin, and running to greater safety.

No one appears to be holding their bulky carry-on luggage - a major factor in how quickly a cabin can be cleared.

Alex Macheras, an aviation analyst, told the BBC that the crew ""were able to initiate a textbook evacuation"" in the crucial first few minutes after impact.

The fire was ""isolated to one area"" of the Airbus A350 for the initial 90 seconds, allowing them a brief window to get everyone out.

He said the crew were clearly able to understand which doors were away from the flames, which is why pictures show not all the exits were opened for people to escape through.

He added that passengers can slow things down in panic - for example by trying to grab their bags from lockers.

The Airbus A350 is one of the first commercial jets to be made of composite, carbon-fibre materials - which appear to have stood up well to the initial collision and the resulting fire.

All of this was achieved as the fire was quickly spreading to engulf the plane. Video footage showed firefighters battling to contain the blaze, as the plane's fuselage began to break in two.

Mr Yamake, the passenger, said for all of the chaos, it took about five minutes for everyone to get out. ""I saw that the fire had spread in about 10, 15 minutes,"" he added.

Tsubasa Sawada, 28, said he could ""only say it was a miracle, we could have died"".

It took several hours for the fire to finally be extinguished. Fourteen passengers and crew were treated for minor injuries.

Passengers were already trying to come to terms with that they had just lived through, telling their friends and loved ones that they were okay, and preparing for what was to come.

Mr Sawada had one question. ""I want to know why this happened,"" he said, adding that he did not plan to get on another plane until he got the answer.","Japan jet crash: Passengers describe chaos inside flight 516By Graeme Baker BBC NewsBBCPassengers escape as the jet engine continues to sparkFirst came the shock, as the Airbus A350 carrying 379 people collided with a second plane while landing in Tokyo.

By Max Matza BBC News

Claudine Gay served as Harvard president for just six months

Harvard University's president has resigned after facing allegations of plagiarism and criticism over her comments about antisemitism on campus.

Claudine Gay has faced mounting pressure to step down in recent weeks.

In a letter announcing her resignation, she said it was in the ""best interests"" of the university for her to step down.

""It has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigour,"" she said.

""This is not a decision I came to easily. Indeed, it has been difficult beyond words,"" Dr Gay wrote, adding that her resignation would allow Harvard to ""focus on the institution rather than any individual"".

She said she had been subjected to personal threats and ""racial animus"".

The 53-year-old served as president for six months and was the first black person, and only the second woman, to be appointed to lead the Ivy League university. Her tenure was the shortest in its 388-year history.

During a tense congressional hearing last month, Dr Gay said calls for the killing of Jews were abhorrent. She added, however, that it would depend on the context whether such comments would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment.

That comment prompted a widespread backlash and she later apologised in an interview with the university's student newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret,"" Dr Gay said.

Dozens of politicians and some high-profile alumni called for her to step down over the comments.

But nearly 700 staff members rallied behind her in a letter and the university said she would keep her job despite the controversy.

Watch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocide

But since then US media outlets have unearthed several instances of alleged plagiarism in her academic record. Harvard's board investigated the allegations last month, and found two published papers that required additional citation.

The board, however, said that she did not violate standards for research misconduct.

More claims that Dr Gay failed to properly cite academic sources emerged just hours before she resigned on Tuesday, and were published anonymously in the conservative Washington Free Beacon newspaper.

The university's governing Harvard Corporation said in a statement that Dr Gay would resume her faculty position after resigning.

""We thank President Gay for her deep and unwavering commitment to Harvard and to the pursuit of academic excellence,"" it said.

""While President Gay has acknowledged missteps and has taken responsibility for them, it is also true that she has shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks,"" the statement added.

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls,"" the corporation said. ""We condemn such attacks in the strongest possible terms. The search for a new president of the university will begin in due course.""

Dr Gay is the second university official to resign following the 5 December congressional hearing.

Former University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill resigned just days later after an angry backlash. A donor also withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments.","Claudine Gay resigns as Harvard University presidentBy Max Matza BBC NewsReutersClaudine Gay served as Harvard president for just six monthsHarvard University's president has resigned after facing allegations of plagiarism and criticism over her comments about antisemitism on campus.

By Flora Drury BBC News

Riverdale Police Department

Kai Zhuang is alleged to be a victim of cyber kidnapping

A Chinese foreign exchange student has been found freezing but alive in the US after his parents were extorted out of tens of thousands of dollars in a ""cyber kidnapping"" scam.

Kai Zhuang was discovered ""very cold and scared"" in a tent in rural Utah, Riverdale Police said in a statement.

The 17-year-old is believed to have isolated himself after being manipulated by the kidnappers.

His parents were then tricked into paying around $80,000 (£62,600).

Zhuang is one of a number of foreign students targeted by so-called cyber kidnappers in the US recently, Riverdale Police added in their statement.

Police believe Kai was being controlled by the kidnappers as early as 20 December, when he was seen by officers in Provo, Utah, carrying camping equipment.

Those officers arranged for him to be returned to Riverdale - where he lived with a host family - out of concerns for his safety. He did not mention any threats at the time, however.

Police were then contacted on 28 December by the school he was attending, which had been contacted by his parents in China.

Kai's parents had told school officials they had been sent a ransom demand and a picture of their son indicating he was abducted.

According to police, victims of cyber kidnapping are convinced to isolate themselves, and even take pictures to make it appear they are being held captive - despite the kidnappers not being present. Instead, the victim is monitored through Facetime or Skype.

Both the victim and their families are then convinced the other will be harmed if they do not comply.

But despite the kidnappers not being with Kai, police in Utah still feared for his safety, explaining the state's December temperatures meant there was a risk he could ""freeze to death overnight"".

Kai was checked for hypothermia after being found on Sunday

Kai was eventually found around 25 miles (40km) north of Riverdale, near Brigham City, in a tent with ""no heat source"" on Sunday.

He had limited food and water, a heat blanket and a sleeping bag - as well as several phones which police suspect were used to carry out the kidnapping.","Kai Zhuang: Chinese teen found alive in US after 'cyber kidnapping'By Flora Drury BBC NewsRiverdale Police DepartmentKai Zhuang is alleged to be a victim of cyber kidnappingA Chinese foreign exchange student has been found freezing but alive in the US after his parents were extorted out of tens of thousands of dollars in a ""cyber kidnapping"" scam.

Reuters

A long list of people associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is expected to be made public in the coming days.

The disclosures may throw new light on the sex trafficking network directed by Epstein, who died in 2019, and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.

The disgraced millionaire mixed with high-profile figures from the worlds of politics, business and royalty.

A judge ordered the court documents in a lawsuit linked to Maxwell must be unsealed.

There are 187 mentions of ""J Doe"" in the court papers, and many of these will now be given their real names.

Why are these names being made public?

The identities are being revealed under a settled lawsuit against Maxwell, the daughter of a British media tycoon.

She is serving a 20-year prison term for the crimes she committed with Epstein.

The defamation lawsuit was brought by Virginia Giuffre, one of Maxwell's accusers, and at the time the names were kept secret under a court-ordered seal.

But last month a judge in New York ruled these could now come to light.

What did the judge say about the names?

Judge Loretta Preska noted that many of the individuals named in the lawsuit have already been publicly identified by the media or in Maxwell's criminal trial.

She added that many others ""did not raise an objection"" to the release of the documents.

Some of the names on the list will remain sealed, including those belonging to child victims, the judge said in her ruling.

And some individuals may have appeared more than once under different Doe numbers, so the exact number of names to emerge is unknown.

Holly Baltz, investigations editor at the Palm Beach Post, told CNN on Tuesday that new details may be revealed.

Even if the names on the list turn out to be already known, she said, new light may be shed on the exact nature of their relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.

Whose names may be on the Epstein list?

They will be a mixture of people accused of wrongdoing, people making these accusations, and others who were potential witnesses to crimes.

There could be employees of Epstein or people who visited his home or went on his private plane.

Prince Andrew is expected to be on the list. The court filings include 40 documents of evidence from a woman who has made accusations against the prince.

Johanna Sjoberg claimed Prince Andrew groped her breast while sitting on a couch inside Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001.

Buckingham Palace has previously said the allegations are ""categorically untrue"".

Last year, the prince paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a lawsuit she filed claiming that he sexually abused her when she was 17 years old.

He said he had never met Ms Giuffre and denied her allegations.

Will Bill Clinton be on the Epstein list?

The former US president is mentioned more than 50 times in the court documents, according to ABC News. But there is no implication of any illegality.

He travelled on Epstein's plane on humanitarian trips to Africa in the early 2000s and at the time praised Epstein as a committed philanthropist.

Mr Clinton's team have previously said that he cut ties with Epstein before the financier came under investigation. They have in the past said he knows nothing about Epstein's crimes.

Many of his mentions in these court filings relate to Ms Giuffre's unsuccessful attempts to make the former president testify about his relationship with Epstein, says ABC.

Who is Jeffrey Epstein?

Epstein, a millionaire known to mix with high-profile figures like Prince Andrew, died in jail in 2019.

His death, as he awaited federal sex-trafficking charges, was ruled to be a suicide by the New York medical examiner.

He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of underage girls for sex. He pleaded not guilty.","Jeffrey Epstein list: What to expect from court filings unsealed in New YorkReutersA long list of people associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is expected to be made public in the coming days.

The fire from the crash took Rochester firefighters an hour to extinguish

The FBI is investigating a New Year's Day crash in upstate New York that killed three people and injured at least nine more.

Concertgoers were leaving a venue in Rochester on Monday morning when an SUV filled with petrol canisters crashed into another vehicle near a crosswalk.

Rochester police said there is currently no evidence the actions of the SUV driver were ""motivated by any form political or social biases"".

The driver later died in hospital.

The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is part of the investigation into the collision. Jeremy Bell, with the FBI's Rochester bureau, said that calling in the task force is not abnormal in cases like these.

""What I can tell you is so far we've uncovered no evidence of an ideology and no nexus to terrorism, international or domestic,"" he said at a press briefing on Tuesday.

The Ford SUV was driving ""fast"", police say, when it collided into a Mitsubishi Outlander leaving the Kodak Center, a performing arts venue, shortly before 01:00 local time (06:00 GMT).

The force of the collision caused the two vehicles to go through a group of pedestrians that were in the crosswalk and then hit two other vehicles.

It also set off a blaze that took nearly an hour to extinguish. At least a dozen gas canisters were found in and around the Ford.

Two passengers in the backseat of the Mitsubishi Outlander were killed while the driver was transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The Mitsubishi was an Uber.

The driver of the Ford Expedition was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries and later died, Rochester police said on Tuesday.

At least nine pedestrians were injured and three were transported to hospital - one now has ""life-altering injuries"".

Police identified the Ford's driver as Michael Avery, 35, from Syracuse, New York, which is 87miles (140km) east of Rochester. He rented a hotel room on 27 December and then rented the Ford once in the area. He also bought the petrol cannister while in the city.

While a motive is unclear, police have spoken to his family and said he may have been suffering from undiagnosed mental health issues.

On Monday, Rochester Mayor Malik Evans said in a statement that: ""I know our community has many questions about this incident, and I ask for patience as investigators work diligently to piece together the details.""","FBI investigating deadly New Year's Day collision in Rochester, New YorkBy Chloe Kim BBC News, New YorkCBSThe fire from the crash took Rochester firefighters an hour to extinguishThe FBI is investigating a New Year's Day crash in upstate New York that killed three people and injured at least nine more.

Jenni Hermoso outside court on Tuesday

Spanish World Cup-winning footballer Jenni Hermoso has testified to a Madrid court that a kiss from former football federation president Luis Rubiales was ""not consensual"".

He grabbed Ms Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips after the World Cup final last year.

A judge will now decide whether Mr Rubiales should be tried for sexual assault and coercion.

""All is in the hands of justice, that's all I can say,"" she told reporters.

The former federation chief denies the allegations.

Ms Hermoso, Spain's top scorer, testified to the court for around two and a half hours, and according to Spanish media she told the judge the kiss was ""unexpected and at no time consensual"".

Her evidence was said to have reiterated testimony given several months ago to prosecutors that was then leaked to Spanish TV,

The court is examining evidence including CCTV footage to decide whether to take her criminal complaint of sexual assault and coercion to trial.

The kiss took place during the medal ceremony in Sydney on 20 August last year, following Spain's win over England.

A statement issued shortly after the final that was attributed to Ms Hermoso had indicated the kiss had been consensual. But she later complained of being pressured by officials of the Spanish football federation to put her name to the statement.

Mr Rubiales is being investigated for possible coercion over his role in the alleged pressure on Ms Hermoso.

Jorge Vilda, the coach who led the team to World Cup glory before being sacked shortly afterwards, is also being investigated along with Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera, both federation executives.

Ms Hermoso said she did not want to be kissed and that she felt that she had been a ""victim of assault"". Under Spanish law a kiss without consent can be deemed a form of sexual assault.

Mr Rubiales has always maintained the kiss was a ""consensual peck"" but in the wake of the incident he was forced to resign as president of the Spanish football federation.

Prosecutors opened an investigation and last September he was barred by investigating judge Francisco de Jorge from going within 200m (650ft) of the footballer.

In a statement to prosecutors leaked to Spanish TV in October, Ms Hermoso said that ""clearly I felt disrespected"" as a player and a person.

""I didn't do anything to land myself in that situation... how could I expect it in that scenario of a medal ceremony at a World Cup final?""

Ms Hermoso, 33, announced on Monday that she was changing clubs. She is leaving Mexico's Pachuca, where she has played since 2022, for Tigres UANL, the country's most successful women's side.

His nine-year-old daughter Elianna and seven-year-old son Aden were found dead at a home in Colorado.

As well as the two counts of first degree murder, she is also charged with one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said she had been arrested in the Kensington area ""without incident"" and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday for an extradition hearing.

She was remanded in custody and will next appear in court on 29 January.

Her daughter and son were found dead on 19 December, along with her 11-year-old daughter who was injured, US police said.

By Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman BBC News

Reuters

Models pose with a BYD car in Japan

Chinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector.

BYD said on Monday it had sold a record 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the final quarter of 2023.

It marked the first quarter its battery-only sales have outpaced Tesla's. The US-based firm has seen demand slow as borrowing costs climb.

However, for the whole of 2023, Mr Musk's Tesla still sold more.

On Tuesday, Tesla said it delivered a record 484,500 electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023 and 1.8 million for the year as a whole.

The end-of-year performance was better than analysts had expected, as sales rose 20% from the same period in 2022 and picked up pace from earlier in 2023. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described the quarter as a ""clear win"" for Tesla.

But it fell short of earlier hopes. Last January, Mr Musk said that Tesla had the potential to achieve two million deliveries in 2023.

The firm cut prices repeatedly to try to woo buyers.

The milestone achieved by BYD is a reminder of the challenges facing the firm, which helped to launch the electric vehicle industry.

""As BYD has accelerated into the fast lane, it's fresh evidence of just how competitive the EV market has become and how hard it will be for Tesla to swerve back to head the pack,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

For the year as a whole, Shenzen-based BYD sold more than 3 million so-called-new energy vehicles (NEVs), which includes battery-only vehicles and hybrids.

Almost 1.6 million of its total sales were battery-only vehicles, the firm said.

BYD's chief executive Wang Chuanfu co-founded BYD with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995.

The company made a name for itself as a manufacturer of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports.

It started selling its shares on the stock market in 2002 and diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company.

Since 2008 BYD has counted veteran US investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder.

Analysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money.

Many of BYD's competitors rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries.","China’s BYD overtakes Tesla's electric car sales in last quarter of 2023By Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman BBC NewsReutersModels pose with a BYD car in JapanChinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector.

Watch: Residential buildings were hit in several areas of Kyiv and Kharkiv in further Russian strikes

Russian missiles have hit Ukraine's biggest cities, leaving at least five dead and dozens hurt, after Vladimir Putin vowed to intensify attacks.

A woman was killed and 44 others were hurt in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, according to local officials.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said two people died and 49 were wounded in a strike on blocks of flats in the Solomianskyi district of the capital.

Two more deaths were reported in the broader Kyiv region.

There have been major aerial assaults by both sides in recent days.

Russia launched its biggest aerial bombardment of the war late last week, killing more than 40 people. Ukrainian forces responded with an attack on the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday, which killed at least 25 people and injured more than 100.

Russia's Vladimir Putin vowed that attack would not go unpunished and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said since Sunday alone, Moscow had fired 170 drones and dozens of missiles.

Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday that it had downed 35 drones launched by Russia on Monday night. Russian strategic bombers then followed up the drone strikes with further attacks.

Ukraine's armed forces said after the drone strikes, 99 missiles of various kinds had been fired in a repeat of last Friday's onslaught, from sea and air. They said 72 cruise and supersonic missiles had been destroyed.

Poland said it had deployed four F-16 fighter jets to secure its airspace in light of Russia's ""long-range aviation activity"". Last Friday, Poland said an unidentified object, probably a Russian missile, had entered Polish airspace for several minutes before turning back towards Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said it had accidentally dropped explosives on a village in the southern Russian region of Voronezh, damaging six houses. Governor Alexander Gusev said there had been an ""emergency descent"" on Petropavlovka, about 150km (93 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

Mickey's Mouse Trap

It's Mickey, but not as you've ever seen him before.

A trailer for a slasher film, featuring a masked killer dressed as Mickey Mouse, was released on 1 January, the day that Disney's copyright on the earliest versions of the cartoon character expired in the US.

""We wanted the polar opposite of what exists,"" the movie's producer said.

A new Mickey-inspired horror game, showing the rodent covered with blood stains, also dropped on the same day.

Steamboat Willie, a 1928 short film featuring early non-speaking versions of Mickey and Minnie, entered the public domain in the US on New Year's Day.

It means cartoonists, novelists and filmmakers can now rework and use the earliest versions of Mickey and Minnie.

In fact, anyone can use those versions without permission or cost.

Creatives have been quick to take advantage of the new rules, with a trailer (contains violent scenes) for a Mickey horror film dropping on the same day.

In the horror comedy thriller, called Mickey's Mouse Trap, a young woman is thrown a surprise birthday party in an amusement arcade - but things quickly take a turn for the worse when she and her friends encounter a knife-wielding murderer in a Mickey costume.

""A place for fun, a place for friends, a place for hunting. The mouse is out,"" the trailer screams in red text.

""People need to not take it too seriously, we made a ridiculously fun movie,"" said Simon Phillips, who wrote and produce the film and plays the man behind the Mickey mask.

Mr Phillips told the BBC that ""if you put Mickey into a family movie, you don't cover new ground"".

""In order to flip the coin, you have to come up with something that's the polar opposite of what already exists,"" he said.

The film itself does not have a confirmed release date but is expected to be out this March.

Not to be outdone, a new video game has been unveiled, also featuring the 1928 version of Mickey.

Game studio Nightmare Forge Games said the game, titled Infestation 88, is a survival horror game in which an outbreak of vermin turns into something more sinister.

At the start of the trailer, a man is heard saying nervously: ""I thought it was just rodents, but there's something else in here.""

A huge, blood splattered Mickey then pops up on screen, while mice scurry around him.

A spokesperson from Nightmare Forge Games told the BBC that Steamboat Willie entering the public domain ""allowed us to include our own derivation of the film's starring character in our game, which fits perfectly as an antagonist causing an infestation"".

Things took a dark turn in Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey

Mickey's not the first childhood character to be given the horror movie treatment.

When Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain, the loveable bear was turned into the R-rated horror film Blood and Honey, which was one of last year's worst-rated films.

US copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on 1 January 2024.

Disney has faced losing the copyright over its original cartoons several times in the past.

The characters were first expected to go into the public domain in 1984, but Congress extended the term by 20 years.

Before the next expiry date came up in 2004, another 20-year extension was passed.

Disney's efforts to protect its characters have even led to the law being dubbed ""the Mickey Mouse Protection Act"". But the moment finally came, and was hailed as being ""deeply symbolic"" by experts.

Watch: Residential buildings were hit in several areas of Kyiv and Kharkiv in further Russian strikes

Russian missiles have hit Ukraine's biggest cities, leaving at least five dead and dozens hurt, after Vladimir Putin vowed to intensify attacks.

A woman was killed and 44 others were hurt in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, according to local officials.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said two people died and 49 were wounded in a strike on blocks of flats in the Solomianskyi district of the capital.

Two more deaths were reported in the broader Kyiv region.

There have been major aerial assaults by both sides in recent days.

Russia launched its biggest aerial bombardment of the war late last week, killing more than 40 people. Ukrainian forces responded with an attack on the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday, which killed at least 25 people and injured more than 100.

Russia's Vladimir Putin vowed that attack would not go unpunished and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said since Sunday alone, Moscow had fired 170 drones and dozens of missiles.

Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday that it had downed 35 drones launched by Russia on Monday night. Russian strategic bombers then followed up the drone strikes with further attacks.

Ukraine's armed forces said after the drone strikes, 99 missiles of various kinds had been fired in a repeat of last Friday's onslaught, from sea and air. They said 72 cruise and supersonic missiles had been destroyed.

Watch: The BBC's Jean Mackenzie visits earthquake region in Japan

Rescue efforts continue in Japan after 55 people were killed in a powerful earthquake that hit the country on New Year's Day.

Homes collapsed, buildings caught fire and roads were extensively damaged, hindering the work of rescue services.

The epicentre of the 7.6 quake was the Noto peninsula, in central Japan.

The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, said emergency services were locked in a ""race against time"" to rescue survivors.

On Tuesday, Mr Kishida also said some 3,000 rescuers were trying to reach parts of the Noto peninsula. Helicopter surveys showed many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The city of Wajima, on the northern tip of Noto, has been cut off from land routes.

The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The country's government has said that 57,360 people had to be evacuated.

Tens of thousands of meals are being delivered across the affected region.

Aftershocks continued throughout Monday and Tuesday. Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi warned people to ""be alert"" for more earthquakes ""of an intensity of up to 7"" in the coming week.

Ishikawa, 155km (96.3 miles) south of the Noto peninsula, experienced a 4.9 quake on Tuesday afternoon.

The major tsunami warnings put out by the Japanese government on Monday were later downgraded. By Tuesday, all tsunami advisories were lifted along the Sea of Japan, meaning there was no longer a risk of such an event.

Residents of the affected area of Japan have been sharing their experiences of the quake, which lasted several minutes.

An 82-year-old resident of Nanao, Toshio Iwahama, told the BBC that his wooden home had partially collapsed. He said that despite living through multiple earthquakes, he had never experienced tremors of this magnitude.

Briton Emma Ward, 41, who was on a skiing holiday in the resort village of Hakuba, said the quake had hit ""without warning"", prompting her group to take shelter under a table in a café. She told the BBC that the intensity of the tremors caused people to flee the building entirely, she said. ""The worst part during the earthquake was not knowing how intense it was going to become. It's a very frightening experience,"" Ms Ward said.

Many also said the quake reminded them of the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 18,000 people and triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima.

In an incident unrelated to the earthquake, a Japan Airlines plane caught fire on Tuesday as it collided with a coastguard aircraft on its way to provide earthquake relief at Tokyo's Haneda airport.

Five people on board the coastguard plane are known to have died, but the Japan Airlines plane's 379 passengers and crew managed to escape.

Japan is one of the most seismically active nations on Earth, owing to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where many tectonic plates meet.","Japan earthquake: Fires hit quake zone as rescuers race to reach survivorsWatch: The BBC's Jean Mackenzie visits earthquake region in JapanRescue efforts continue in Japan after 55 people were killed in a powerful earthquake that hit the country on New Year's Day.

By Kelly Ng BBC News

Reuters

Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck, but his injuries are not life-threatening, medical staff say

South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung has been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.

Mr Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election, sustained a 1cm laceration on the left side of his neck, reports said.

He was airlifted to hospital. Doctors say the wound is not life-threatening.

The 66-year-old man who attacked him said he had intended to kill Mr Lee, Yonhap news agency reported. The motive for the attack is unclear.

The brazen daytime attack shocked the nation and prompted condemnation from political parties and politicians, including current President Yoon Suk Yeol.

Mr Lee, who leads the Democratic Party of Korea, was addressing reporters at a news conference during a visit to a construction site in the port of Busan on Tuesday morning when the attacker reportedly approached him to ask for an autograph.

He then lunged forward to stab the politician with an 18cm (7in) knife which the attacker said he bought online, police said at a media briefing. The attacker was immediately overpowered and arrested.

Prosecutors plan to bring attempted murder charges against the man, Yonhap said.

Videos posted on social media show Mr Lee first collapsing into the crowd and then onto the ground, while several people try to restrain the attacker. Photographs after the incident show Mr Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed as someone presses a handkerchief to the side of his neck.

Watch the moment Lee Jae-myung is stabbed during a press conference

A spokesman for Mr Lee's party said medical staff suspected an injury to his jugular vein, which carries blood from the head to the heart. Mr Lee would have to undergo surgery ""quickly"" as they were concerned about further bleeding, the spokesman, Kwon Chil-seung, said.

He added that they saw the attack as ""a clear act of democracy destruction"". while Mr Yoon's office quoted the president as saying South Korea ""should not tolerate such acts of violence under any circumstance"".

Mr Lee, 59, currently holds a seat in Incheon in South Korea's legislature.

He narrowly lost the 2022 presidential elections - by a mere 0.73% difference in votes - to Mr Yoon, making it the closest presidential race in South Korean history. He is widely expected to stand in the 2027 presidential elections.

Mr Lee, a former civil rights attorney who grew up in poverty and worked in factories as a child, said his working-class roots spurred him to want to fight inequality.

His impoverished upbringing stands in contrast with most other South Korean parliamentarians, who local media report have an average net worth of 2.3bn won ($1.8m; £1.4m) .

Since losing the vote in 2022, Mr Lee has been indicted on corruption and breach of trust charges, with prosecutors accusing him of allowing private developers to profit illegally from a property project while he was mayor of Seongnam, a city of a million people to the south of Seoul. Mr Lee has denied those charges, calling them politically motivated.

In September, a court dismissed a request from the prosecution for him to be held in custody while he awaited trial. Prosecutors are still investigating him on a number of other cases linked to corruption while he was in office.

The dismissal came three weeks after Mr Lee staged a 19-day hunger strike to protest at Mr Yoon's foreign and domestic policies, ending with Mr Lee requiring hospital treatment.

South Korea's crime rate is generally low, although the country saw a rise in mass stabbing attacks last year. The country has strict regulations around possession of guns and other weapons, and most public figures are not usually under tight security protection.

There have been a number of previous cases of South Korean politicians being physically attacked with weapons.

In March 2022, Mr Lee's predecessor as Democratic Party leader, Song Young-gil, was attacked with a blunt object while campaigning for Mr Lee. He sustained a laceration.

In 2006, conservative party leader Park Geun-hye, who later became president, was attacked with a knife which left a scar on her face.

In 1979, her father Park Chung-hee, who was president for 16 years, was shot and killed by his spy chief at a private dinner.","Lee Jae-myung: South Korea opposition leader stabbed in neck on visit to BusanBy Kelly Ng BBC NewsReutersLee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck, but his injuries are not life-threatening, medical staff saySouth Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung has been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.

By Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis BBC News Science

BBC/TONY JOLLIFFE

The skull of a colossal sea monster that was unearthed from the Jurassic Coast has gone on public display.

The 2m-long fossil belongs to a pliosaur - one of the most fearsome predators the planet has ever seen.

Sir David Attenborough investigated the discovery in a BBC film which aired on New Year's Day.

The public can see the 150-million-year-old marine reptile at the Etches Collection in Kimmeridge in Dorset, close to where the beast was found.

The rest of its skeleton may still be entombed in the crumbling cliffs. The hope is it may eventually be recovered.

BBC Studios

The whole excavation was conducted on ropes high above the Dorset beach

The snout of the pliosaur was discovered by a fossil enthusiast on a beach near Kimmeridge Bay.

The rest of its skull was extracted from half-way down a fast-eroding cliff face by a team precariously dangling from ropes.

Steve Etches led the effort to remove and prepare the fossil.

It's now being unveiled at the museum that bears his name, sitting alongside the Jurassic fossils he's spent a lifetime collecting.

""It's going to be impressive, especially when children come, because they'll come in and see it face-on - which should have the required effect,"" he told BBC News.

BBC Studios

Artwork: These top predators would have grown to about the same length as a double decker bus

The pliosaur skull is one of the most complete specimens ever found and it is exquisitely preserved.

It doesn't take much imagination to see that this would have been the ultimate killing machine.

Its enormous crocodile-like jaw is packed with 130 razor sharp teeth, and cavernous holes on either side of the skull would have been filled with huge muscles.

Researchers estimate that its bite force would have been in the same range as a T. Rex - earning the pliosaur the nickname of ""sea rex"".

Growing to 10-12m in length, the ancient reptile would have powered itself through the ocean using four huge paddle-like limbs.

So, despite its bulk, it would have moved quickly.

Passing prey would have been killed with a single bite, and then gulped straight down - scientists think this monster didn't bother to chew its food.

""Pliosaurs were the top of the food chain,"" said Steve Etches,

BBC/Tony Jolliffe

The 2m-long pliosaur skull, which is being unveiled, is one of the most complete ever found

""They'd even feed on their own kind, because in the collections we've got pliosaur bones with pliosaur bite marks in them.""

As well as public interest in this prehistoric beast, researchers are also keen to get up close with the fossil.

It has features not seen on other pliosaurs, including a high head crest, which suggests it may be a species new to science.

And what about the rest of the pliosaur's body?

If the skeleton is still in the Kimmeridge cliff clay, with the coastline rapidly eroding, it really is a race against time.

Steve Etches wants to get it out, before it's lost to the sea forever.

By Jonathan Amos Science correspondent

The earthquake, which took place on New Year's Day, has left a trail of destruction across Ishikawa Prefecture

The power of the magnitude 7.5 quake in Japan can be seen in just how much the ground moved.

It rose up by more than 4m (13ft) in places and moved sideways by over a metre.

Earthquake-prone Japan is hugely advanced in monitoring what happens when the ground shakes. That's why it can make such precise measurements.

There's a network of GPS stations dotted at strategic points right across the country. When an earthquake strikes, scientists can tell exactly how much each one has moved, showing how the landscape has buckled and shifted.

This system shows that the land moved as much as 130cm to the west after the earthquake on Monday.

Meanwhile, scientists have also been keeping an eye on Japan from space, comparing satellite images taken before and after the earthquake.

On its latest pass, the ALOS-2 spacecraft reported that the distance between itself and the ground had shortened as the Earth's surface had risen up under the force of the tremor.

The ground moved the most on the western side of the Noto peninsula. The ocean floor shifted off the coast there, generating tsunami waves of about 80cm in height.

Fortuitously, the uplift may actually have lessened the impact of the waves when they arrived at the shoreline.

Any death is one too many, but it is remarkable just how few have occurred, even as searches continue for those still trapped in the rubble. The loss and damage models have been predicting an eventual toll of, at most, a hundred or so.

It's worth comparing this event with last year's M7.8 quake in Turkey. The two were broadly similar in terms of the energy released, but the death toll in Turkey and Syria rose to 50,000 and more. Go back to 2010 and the M7 quake in Haiti. More than 100,000 people died in that horrific event.

The explanation of the difference is simple: preparedness.

Japan sits at the confluence of four major tectonic plates. It is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth; the country accounts for about 20% of global quakes of Magnitude 6.0 or greater, with seismometers recording some kind of event every five minutes on average. Japan has therefore invested greatly in making its infrastructure and its population resilient.

The building codes - the rules that guide construction - are strictly enforced; and citizens are well trained in how to respond to tremors. Japan also has one of the most advanced early warning systems in the world.

Scientists cannot predict the timing and scale of an event, but once under way instruments will trigger notifications to TV, radio and cell networks. These warnings will arrive for some people distant from the epicentre perhaps 10 to 20 seconds before the onset of the most severe shaking.","How Japan’s powerful earthquakes have shifted the landBy Jonathan Amos Science correspondentEPAThe earthquake, which took place on New Year's Day, has left a trail of destruction across Ishikawa PrefectureThe power of the magnitude 7.5 quake in Japan can be seen in just how much the ground moved.

Fitness businesses are among the companies that see a bump in revenue around the New Year, as people set their goals (Credit: Getty Images)

Consumers flock to health, finance and learning companies to reach their goals. These firms are well aware – and many are seizing the moment to profit.

Get fit. Improve mental health. Make a budget. Learn a language.

New year's resolutions provide an opportunity for brands to pitch consumers on products or services that will help them achieve their goals. Companies know there's revenue potential, especially in membership-based models; many say the start of the new year is an important time to attract new users whom they hope will convert to long-term active paying customers.

""There are specific spikes in demand for certain products around new year because of resolutions,"" says Neil Saunders, US-based managing director at GlobalData, a consulting firm.

If these subscription-based companies can manage the careful balancing act between spending on customer acquisition through discounts and promotions, while considering return on investments in the months to come, they can cash in on the people eager to spend on platforms, services and products that can bring them closer to success. The habits of US consumers serve as an example of how resolutions can be major commercial moments.

Analysts say the start of the new year is an important time for health-focused businesses. Nearly half of Americans polled in an October 2023 Forbes Health-OnePoll survey said they were prioritizing fitness in their new year's goals.

""People have been through the holiday season, they've probably been overindulging,"" says Saunders. ""They're now focused on new year's resolutions to do with wellness and losing weight.""

New York Sports Club, which operates chains of gyms and fitness facilities in the US – such as popular brands including its eponymous club, Lucille Roberts and Fhitting Room – says January is a critical time for customer acquisition, with new member sign-ups as high as two-times a typical month.

Kari Saitowitz, chief marketing and creative officer of New York Sports Club, says the club banks on the new year's period as new business driver: targets for new sign-ups are two-to-three times the goals for most other months. It's not necessarily a revenue play at first; the company offers discounted memberships for new joiners to get them through the door. Last year, New York Sports Club offered new members a $1 joining fee and complimentary membership for the first month.

The long-term profit lies in continued conversion. With the influx of sign-ups, New York Sports Club – and similar membership-based businesses – are hoping these new faces will go on to become loyal customers who pay the standard, higher monthly membership fee after joining on a discount.

""The idea is to get people started off with a really compelling offer for January… you've got to win them over month after month,"" says Saitowitz. At New York Sports Club, a key part of this is ensuring they have free orientation sessions with trainers. They must look at strategy for retention after the new year's rush, too: for instance, she says, the company is in the process of revamping its referral and incentive-based rewards programmes.

New York-based Talkspace – which works directly with consumers and employers to provide mental-health counselling – says January is a natural time for people to seek out therapy, especially after spending time with family or friends during the holidays.

""November and December are often very slow months for therapy. Clients have a lot going on as the holidays are happening,"" says Liz Colizza, director of research and programmes at Talkspace. ""January comes, and people start to look at their lives differently. Everyone takes a look at what the next year is going to hold.""

At the kick-off of a new year, the company has invested in resolution-related marketing to bring in users. Since 2018, Talkspace has organised ongoing brand campaigns with ambassador and American Olympian Michael Phelps, which help users set new year's intentions and prime them to continue throughout the year – which the mental-health company, too, hope leads to ongoing business. In January 2023, would-be users were encouraged to engage with an Instagram post from Phelps as part of a contest to win free therapy sessions.

""It's pretty common for us to have some sort of [theme] around, setting your intentions … thinking about your behaviour and what you want to do in the coming year,"" says Katelyn Watson, chief marketing officer at Talkspace. In Q1 2023, the platform reported a 34% increase in the number of therapy sessions covered by insurance, compared to the prior quarter.

January comes, and people start to look at their lives differently. Everyone takes a look at what the next year is going to hold – Liz Colizza

Personal-finance platforms often experience similar consumer interest during this time, says Jesse Mecham, founder and CEO of global digital budgeting platform YNAB. ""[With] gyms and personal finance, we share so many relations, where people know that they're not doing it right, and they could be doing better,"" he says.

YNAB is a subscription business, billed monthly or annually. The ""New Tear's bump"", as Mecham calls it, can result in around a 25-to-50% boost in new member sign-ups in January. The company typically increases its advertising spend in the lead-up to New Year's Day to capture more interest in the platform.

Similarly, Eric Dunn, CEO of personal-finance platform Quicken, says the company typically gets around 15% of its customers in January. New customer revenue, however, represents, only 10% of the company's revenue, with 90% coming from renewals. These re-ups can happen throughout the year, but are weighted more heavily around the first two calendar quarters, with Q1 being the largest renewal quarter, says Dunn.

As people also seek personal enrichment, Berlin-based language app Babbel sees an opportunity. ""New year's resolutions are a huge boon to language learning, as with so many self-improvement activities,"" says Julie Hansen, Babbel's US CEO and CRO.

The company offers price promotions around the new year, driving a ""significant boost in Q1"", with January being the peak month for US revenue and sales, says Franka Schuster, the company's principal corporate communications manager. Hansen adds, ""For Babbel, January is the largest month of the year by far.""

Duolingo, based in Pittsburgh, US, also offers a discount on its premium subscription only once per year: in January. Consequently, the new year's period is one of the company's biggest customer growth periods of the year, according to Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo's global communications director.

Equinox

Not every company that might see a boost from resolutions uses goals as a marketing tool, however. For global fitness-and-health company Equinox, 2024 marks the second year they are running an anti-new year's resolution campaign called ""We Don't Speak January"", in which they don't allow signups on the first of the year.

""Our members commit to being in our club every day, and so when we look at what the mainstream fitness industry is doing around [1 January] ... they're driving new year's resolutions and using that as a gimmick to sell memberships,"" says Jeff De Korte, chief marketing officer at Equinox. (Some people have criticised the move as a ""stunt"".)

Whatever way consumers receive the marketing approach, Equinox still sees strong member uptick for the remainder of the month – the company says in 2023, Equinox had its largest January sales month in history, approximately 20% higher than January sales prior to the pandemic. And due to the company's membership model of only year-long contracts – something De Korte says he believes promotes a long-term investment in wellness – this spike in sign-ups represents a full-year revenue boost.

Ultimately, despite the surge in resolution-related business early in the year, sustained revenue isn't a given. Companies that see mass sign-ups still must retain customers – especially as they drop off when giving up on their new year's goals. ""They're trying to lock customers in, because one of the problems with resolutions is people make them, they kind of stick to them in January and as the year goes on, they kind of fade into the background,"" says Saunders.","The businesses betting on new year's resolutionsBy Suman Bhattacharyya Features correspondentGetty ImagesFitness businesses are among the companies that see a bump in revenue around the New Year, as people set their goals (Credit: Getty Images)Consumers flock to health, finance and learning companies to reach their goals.

By Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent, in Glasgow

BBC

Bernie - one of the prisoners who took part in the first hip-hop workshops at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.

""I'm living my life / It's time to move on / 'Cause there's no guarantees that tomorrow will come."" Robert, 29, prisoner.

This is hip-hop made inside Barlinnie, Scotland's largest prison and where the Lockerbie bomber Abelbaset al-Megrahi was held.

A rather ghostly reminder of his former presence are the satellite dishes, paid for by the Libyan government so that he could watch sport, which still hang off the side of the building where he was kept.

Situated in the north east edge of Glasgow and known as The Big Hoose and Bar-L, Barlinnie is more than 140 years old. The prison is to be closed as soon as a replacement is built, but that date keeps being put back.

On the bitingly cold day we visit, capacity is running at almost 145%, with 1,418 prisoners inside, when it was designed for 987.

It was against this background that Barlinnie launched its first ever hip-hop classes for prisoners. Funded by Creative Scotland, the eight-week course conceived by Jill Brown who runs Conviction Records, Scotland's first record label for ex-offenders.

She explains: ""The workshops are designed to give the guys who take part a voice, because a lot of people who are actually in jail have never had a voice. It's really about confidence and self-esteem and dignity and people believing in you.

""But also they give people in prison something to look forward to and I always say that the poverty of hope is the worst form of destitution.""

HM Prison Barlinnie, which opened in 1882, is the largest prison in Scotland

We have been allowed behind bars, to speak to some of those taking part, although our visit was almost cancelled. The night before, Barlinnie makes the Scottish news headlines, as a prisoner managed to climb onto the roof and throw slates at guards as part of a one-man protest.

By the following morning he is back inside, and we are allowed to proceed.

First up, a visit to B Hall, where 279 prisoners are held in predominantly double cells. Over four levels with stone staircases and caged balconies, it is not hard to image exactly how Barlinnie looked when it first opened in the 1880s.

The prisoners are in a red sweatshirt if they have been convicted or a blue one if they are on remand.

Up on the second floor we are taken to the cell of Bernie. If Eminem was 32 and from Govan, this is what he would look like, and Bernie shares that he did once jump over a fence to sneak into a Slim Shady gig in Glasgow.

The tiny room is dominated by white-washed brick walls, two desks and a metal bunk bed, which he shares with his ""co-pilot"".

""When I first came in, I was stuck in my cell 23 hours a day,"" Bernie says, shaking his head.

""People obviously want to see people get punished, but we are getting punished. We're in our cells. We're already living in a prison in our head.""

Bernie is now allowed out to work in the kitchens and the hip-hop classes offer another escape, his love of Snoop Dogg and Tupac demonstrated by small computer printout posters of the rappers on his cell wall.

He has been in Barlinnie since Boxing Day last year: ""I was running about breaking into businesses to fund my habit. Things that I would never normally do. That isn't me as a person, but that's where taking hard drugs took me.""

Back in his early 20s, Bernie had a bit of a following locally as a rapper, DJing on community radio. Being allowed to work on a new track with a real producer has given him a boost: ""It keeps me good as it's something I love doing,"" he explains.

""You can do positive things with music. It's helped bring my confidence back.""

It is time for us to head to today's workshop and somewhat surprisingly Bernie suddenly pulls out an acoustic guitar from under his bunk, before being escorted by guards to the Wellbeing Centre, an area of the prison which hosts rehabilitation programmes.

Daddy's Girl

Here, the musician Becci Wallace is waiting to work with Bernie on his track, a rather delicate and heartfelt tribute to his daughter, called Daddy's Girl. He strums the guitar and softly delivers the lines:

""I remember the day you were born, the moment you came out the womb / And there was you, me, and my gran inside the room.""

This kind of lyrical honesty is exactly what Wallace believes the sessions can achieve: ""My hope is that, for some of the guys at least, it might be the first chance they've had to be vulnerable in a safe space.

""And that actually the long-term benefits of that for them is that rather than reacting quickly and sometimes negatively in difficult situations, that they will remember that they have the ability to work things out.""

And Becci has a message for those who are not in favour of free music classes being given to convicted criminals: ""If they are continuing to make the same mistakes over and over again and coming back here, then why not try something new?""

Robert, one of the prisoners taking part, says the workshops have given him hope.

One serial reoffender taking part in the workshops is Robert from Kilmarnock who is 29 and currently serving a sentence of just under three years. He believes that the hip-hop classes can bring about change in his life.

For the last two months he has been working with Becci on his track Time, with lyrics which share his fears about the future: ""Sometimes I think it is all fate? / Will I die young like half of my mates? / I've been numbing the pain, but the pain still hurts.""

""It's gave me something to look forward to,"" he says about the workshops.

""And it's something I'm going to follow up on when I'm out. It's came at the right time It's gave me a chance.""

And could it really help him stop reoffending?

""Aye. 100% aye,"" he nods insisting that he has more hope for when is released this time, than ever before.

Hip-hop showcase

The culmination of the hip-hop workshops was a small showcase, where recordings of their songs were played to an audience made up of other prisoners and guards.

On the day, Bernie decided that his track about his daughter was not completed, so instead made a last-minute recording of some old angrier lyrics he had written, laying them down over a Dr Dre style beat.

The song, called Hate These Streets, is well received and Bernie is a very relieved man. He dreams of putting his music up on YouTube once he is released: ""That will help me stay out of trouble, help me focus, more positive energy and less negative energy.

""I'm changing my life for the better now and I've got high hopes that I'm going to be alright.""

And for Robert having his music played in front of an audience was a big moment.

""It's gave me hope man, so it has. It's gave me a lot of hope. This time in prison I've turned it into a positive, so I have.""

The workshops will be returning in 2024, but with a twist. Before we depart the organiser Jill Brown explains: ""Hip-hop tends to appeal to the younger contingent, and a lot of the guys are singer-songwriters, so we have decided to give an alternative next year.""","The Scottish prisoners making hip-hop behind barsBy Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent, in GlasgowBBCBernie - one of the prisoners who took part in the first hip-hop workshops at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/67772432,Naomi Osaka and her team talk about the former world number one's long-awaited comeback,['Author not found'],"Osaka is making her return to tennis at the Brisbane International after 15 months away

Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series.

At a family dinner to celebrate her 22nd birthday, Naomi Osaka turned to her mother to ask whether she thought her daughter would have achieved more by this point in her life.

Tamaki Osaka shook her head.

""Or do you think this is acceptable?"" the birthday girl followed up.

""More than acceptable,"" was the reply.

When that exchange was captured by a Netflix mini-series, external-link Osaka was already a two-time Grand Slam champion and world number one.

What we did not know then was that Osaka had been suffering ""long bouts of depression"" since winning her first Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2018.

There have been two more Grand Slam titles to enjoy since that birthday celebration, but also some painful months to endure.

Osaka was questioning her direction in the sport in the autumn of 2022 when she fell pregnant.

Shai was born in July and, in an interview to mark her return to the tour after a 15-month absence, Osaka told BBC Sport the arrival of her daughter has ""completed"" her as a person.

""I almost kind of needed her in my life,"" she explained in Brisbane.

""I'm the type of person that can't really think about myself. I make rash decisions and she's helped me mature so much already. I'm a lot more comfortable with who I am and I'm just very thankful for every day.

""To know there's a tiny human who loves me no matter what, and my days just light up because of her, that kind of completes me as a person as well.""

Shai's birth was not straightforward, as the umbilical cord became wrapped around her daughter's neck during the delivery.

While pregnant, Osaka suffered with morning sickness - her first real experience of ""throwing up"". The nausea was only relieved by eating plain crackers, but that came at the cost of weight gain which was already preying on her mind.

And despite Osaka's history of depression - which she detailed for the first time after pulling out of the 2021 French Open - she was caught off-guard by the stealthy onset of post-natal depression.

""I did get affected by it. I don't think I knew at the time - I just thought it was a big transition,"" she said.

""But I was lucky. My mum was there, so she helped me out a lot, but it's a very dramatic change.

""There was a period of time when everything felt very hectic.

""I'm fine now and actually I'm much better than I was before - I feel really calm and relaxed.""

Those around Osaka appreciate the importance of keeping things that way.

Belgian coach Wim Fissette worked with Osaka when she won the 2020 US Open and the Australian Open the following January. They parted in July 2022, only to reunite in October this year.

""It's always a tough topic, but I need to be careful in the past months where she has been training non-stop,"" Fissette said shortly after Osaka won her first-round match against Tamara Korpatsch at the Brisbane International.

""Starting tournaments, it's going to be important for us to give her, at the right moments, time off - to switch really off.

""On the other hand, the communication from her to the team has become better - she's much more open than before. She's better now at communicating how she feels.""

Becoming a mother during an on-court career is refreshingly normal on the WTA Tour these days.

Angelique Kerber returned from maternity leave at this week's United Cup and Petra Kvitova used the first few minutes of 2024 to announce she and her husband Jiri are expecting a baby in the summer.

""Becoming a mum made me realise how strong I am, and how strong all mums are,"" Osaka said.

""I also want mums to feel like they are capable of anything, because I think they are.""

Osaka's most recent Grand Slam title was the 2021 Australian Open, where she beat American Jennifer Brady in the final

But Osaka, one of sport's most powerful voices on social issues, is also anxious to point out that new mothers should not for a moment compare themselves to her, only six months after childbirth.

Not many mothers have either the physical training she has endured or the logistical help that she enjoys.

""It was very difficult - honestly almost impossible if I didn't have the people around me,"" Osaka said with a laugh.

""I don't think new mums should look at me and think that this is realistic.

""I have had to plan my day by the second, so after I train I just sprint to my car and go and see Shai.

""Every person's body is different. For example, 30 minutes after I gave birth they wanted me to be wheeled around, but I told them I felt completely fine to walk. It was a bit weird because I had to demonstrate that I could walk.

""I learned a lot about the human body but the core was fascinating because I couldn't even sit up out of the bed - I had to roll out of my bed.""

The man responsible for that physical strengthening is Florian Zitzelsberger. The German has previously worked with Kvitova and Kevin Anderson, and briefly with Osaka in 2022.

As well as a strength and conditioning coach, Zitzelsberger is also an osteopath with a keen interest in nutrition.

""When you have an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) rupture or an ankle strain, you have healing weeks; you have a clear protocol,"" he explained.

""With giving birth it's totally different. The core has to be destroyed because the core, the pelvis, is just made for creating a baby.

""The first question I wanted to know was how she feels as a mother. I just saw the sparkling in her eyes that she's just super happy.

""When we came to the question of ambitions, and how much motivation she has, she just said she wants to use every minute she has now to get back there and make her daughter proud.

""Just these few sentences showed me that she's really ready to do the hard work again and conquer the tour again.""

Osaka and Fissette (left) have come back together for her return after a spell of nearly three years together between 2019 and 2022

Osaka says she did not watch the Australian Open or the French Open in 2023 as it would have made her realise what she was missing.

She confirmed her intention to return to the professional game during September's US Open and pledged to design a busier schedule than has been typical for her in the past. When the really hard work began the next month, Fissette duly detected a significant change in her.

""The last time I saw her was around July 2022, when we stopped working together, and I honestly really didn't know where her career was going to,"" he said.

""When I spoke to her again this year in September, she already sounded like a new person. And a person with a lot of strong ambitions.

""I've never seen her this way before where she was so hungry to learn. She was such a happy person on the court and the last weeks she has worked so hard and with so much discipline.

""I would say she was definitely the ideal player.""

Fissette says Osaka has always been good at scheduling, so a typical training day runs from 8am until 3pm, with the late afternoons reserved for time with her daughter.

The familiar sight of her slapping her left thigh before a crucial point was in evidence once again as she beat Korpatsch in her first match back, but the long-term goal is to create an even better version of Osaka - a better athlete and more powerful player with greater variety.

She has stated her desire to compete more strongly on clay and grass, and greater exposure to these surfaces can only help in that development.

Osaka says winning future Grand Slam titles and representing Japan in the Olympics would be wonderful, but that it is more important to ""cherish"" every tournament she plays.

She wants to be able to travel the world with her daughter and make her appreciate there should be no barriers to her own ambitions.

How quickly could success come for Osaka? She has travelled to Australia without Shai, and she would surely not be here if she did not believe she can cut it with the best players in the world.

""That would be a disservice to myself and also the people who want to see me play,"" was her reply.

""I can't really say whether I'm going to do amazing or not, but I feel pretty good with where I'm at right now and I'm pretty competitive.""

Asked about Osaka's chances at the Australian Open, Fissette said: ""I will always see her as a possible winner, but I am also realistic.

""She is always a candidate. I cannot predict results, but I will promise you that she will be a better tennis player than she has ever been before. For sure.""

Listen to Naomi Osaka's interview with BBC Sport, along with Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal, on 5 Live Tennis at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday.

If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.","When that exchange was captured by a Netflix mini-series, external-link Osaka was already a two-time Grand Slam champion and world number one.
There have been two more Grand Slam titles to enjoy since that birthday celebration, but also some painful months to endure.
""On the other hand, the communication from her to the team has become better - she's much more open than before.
She's better now at communicating how she feels.""
""Just these few sentences showed me that she's really ready to do the hard work again and conquer the tour again."""

Mr Lai, 76, is the most prominent person charged for violating the Beijing-backed National Security Law

Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai has pleaded not guilty to sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a landmark security trial.

Mr Lai, 76, faces life imprisonment if convicted of threatening China's national security.

His case has sparked an international outcry and is widely seen as a test of Hong Kong's judicial independence.

His landmark trial started on 18 December after a year-long delay and is expected to last for about 80 days.

Mr Lai has been held in solitary confinement since December 2020, following his arrest for fraud and for his involvement in protests in the former British territory.

He is a UK citizen and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron is among those who have called for his release.

He is the most prominent person charged with violating the Beijing-backed National Security Law (NSL), which critics allege is being used to crack down on dissent.

Just hours before he was charged in 2020, Mr Lai said in a BBC interview that he sees himself as a ""born rebel"" with a ""very rebellious character"".

Mr Lai founded the now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. He was also on the frontlines of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, from 2014's Umbrella Movement to huge demonstrations against a Beijing-backed extradition bill five years later.

He is among more than 250 activists, lawmakers and protesters detained under the NSL and sedition charges.

The NSL was introduced in 2020 in response to mammoth pro-democracy protests. Beijing says it is necessary to quell unrest. It has also referred to Mr Lai as a traitor who seeks to undermine China's security.

Mr Lai was born in southern China's Guangzhou province in 1947. He left China when he was just 12 and escaped to Hong Kong as a stowaway on a boat.

In Hong Kong, Mr Lai worked in a garment sweatshop and taught himself English. He later founded the global apparel brand Giordano.

His career veered towards political activism and media after tanks crushed pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989.","Jimmy Lai: Hong Kong mogul pleads not guilty to national security crimesBy Joel Guinto BBC NewsGetty ImagesMr Lai, 76, is the most prominent person charged for violating the Beijing-backed National Security LawHong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai has pleaded not guilty to sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a landmark security trial.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67858866,Wayne Rooney: Birmingham City sack manager after just 15 games in charge,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Birmingham

Wayne Rooney only picked up 10 points from his 15 matches in charge of Birmingham City

Birmingham City have sacked manager Wayne Rooney after just 83 days in charge of the Championship club.

The 38-year-old was appointed on 11 October following the controversial decision to dismiss John Eustace, with Blues sixth in the table.

Since then they have slipped to 20th, Monday's 3-0 loss at Leeds having been the ninth defeat of his 15-game tenure.

""Football is a results business and I recognise they've not been at the level I wanted them to be,"" Rooney said.

Professional development coach Steve Spooner will take interim charge for Birmingham, who have also parted company with one of Rooney's backroom team, former Wolves and Wales midfielder Carl Robinson.

'It will take time to get over this setback'

Rooney said he now plans to take a break from the game.

""I would like to thank (co-owners) Tom Wagner and Tom Brady and (chief executive) Garry Cook for the opportunity to manage Birmingham City and the support they all gave me during my short period with the club,"" he said.

""However, time is the most precious commodity a manager requires and I do not believe 13 weeks was sufficient to oversee the changes that were needed.

""Personally, it will take me some time to get over this setback.

""I have been involved in professional football, as either a player or manager, since I was 16. Now, I plan to take some time with my family as I prepare for the next opportunity in my journey as a manager.""

The appointment of former England captain Rooney, who previously had spells in charge of Derby County and MLS side DC United, bore comparisons with the club's ill-fated decision to sack Gary Rowett in December 2016 and replace him with a globally-known name in Gianfranco Zola.

But Zola won just twice in 22 games before being sacked in April 2017, to be succeeded by Harry Redknapp.

Since Blues' new American owners Shelby Companies Limited appointed Rooney, again in the search for global impact, he has also won just two matches - and the board's hope for successful, more exciting football has not been met.

Rowett, who left Millwall in October, is already being touted as one of the names under consideration to become caretaker boss - a list that also includes former Swansea City and sacked Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper.

Blues are six points clear of the relegation places and travel to Hull City in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.

They face three crucial league games before the close of the January transfer window - all against teams just above them in the table, Swansea and Middlesbrough at home, either side of Stoke away.

It was always assumed that Rooney, appointed after the last transfer window closed, would be given the January transfer window to put things right.

But the club have opted to act now, giving a new manager time to work on any potential new signings.

Rooney is now the shortest-serving Blues manager, in terms of time period, in their 132-year history. But he lasted two games longer than Redknapp, who, after keeping Blues up, left six weeks into the 2017-18 season after just 13 games.

Rooney has plug pulled sooner than Zola

Analysis - BBC Radio WM's Richard Wilford

Few observers at St Andrew's can be accused of 20-20 hindsight when suggesting that Rooney's short-lived tenure was inevitable.

The parallels with Zola's ill-fated half-season in 2016-17 were hard to ignore, the main difference being that the new owners have chosen to pull the plug far sooner.

That Birmingham CEO Garry Cook should choose to promise ""no-fear football"" at Rooney's unveiling was to hang an albatross round the former England striker's neck.

Gianfranco Zola won just two of his 22 matches in charge of Birmingham in 2016-17

Some of the players would understandably fear a radical change of style. They frankly had not been recruited to implement it in the first place.

Eustace had everyone singing off the same sheet, challenging for a play-off spot. Like Rowett seven years earlier, he may not have achieved a top-six finish in the end, but both would surely have avoided the chaos that followed.

If there was one sliding door moment for Rooney, it came at Plymouth.

Following a fully controlled win at Cardiff and a decent showing in defeat at home by Leicester, Blues were ahead at Home Park when Krystian Bielik was harshly sent off. They failed to defend a 3-1 lead with 10 men, leaving Devon with only a draw.

Flat, listless performances against Stoke, Bristol City and then Leeds clearly concentrated minds as the Championship's trap door drew closer.

Given the apparent stability and undoubted ambition of the new ownership group and the positive work they are clearly doing off the field, this will serve as a sharp lesson about the realities of football. Timing is everything, and profile alone does not garner league points.

'Change in best interests of club'

In a statement, Birmingham chief executive Cook said they felt the time was right to move in a different direction.

""Despite their best efforts, results have not met the expectations that were made clear at the outset. Therefore, the board feels that a change in management is in the best interests of the club,"" Cook said.

""The club's board and management are fully aligned and will continue to drive transformation and take bold steps to rebuild Birmingham City into the organisation its fans and community deserve.

""We are committed to doing what is necessary to bring success to St Andrew's.

""Unfortunately, Wayne's time with us did not go as planned and we have decided to move in a different direction.

""The search for a successor begins with immediate effect and we will update supporters when we have further news.

""The remaining coaching staff will be required to continue with their duties to assist Steve Spooner.""","Last updated on .From the section BirminghamWayne Rooney only picked up 10 points from his 15 matches in charge of Birmingham CityBirmingham City have sacked manager Wayne Rooney after just 83 days in charge of the Championship club.

Dior and Nike collaborated in 2020 to release the limited-edition sneakers

A Melbourne man who spent nearly 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,100) on shoes he now believes to be fake has had his case thrown out by a tribunal.

He was seeking a refund for seven pairs of sneakers, some of them ultra-rare shoes produced jointly by sportswear and fashion giants Nike and Dior.

But state legal authorities found he had knowingly bought the trainers from a boy who was only 17 at the time.

That meant he could not sign contracts and was not liable for refunds.

In October last year, the man, an estate agent, took the 17-year-old student and his father to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Vcat) to ask for a refund on the seven pairs of shoes.

Four of the pairs were limited-edition shoes from a collaboration between Nike and Dior. Only 4,700 high-tops and 8,500 low-tops of the Dior x Nike Air Jordan 1 sneakers were available for purchase via a raffle system.

The man paid sums ranging from A$3,800 (£2,040) to A$10,000 (£5,370) for each pair of Nike Air Jordan 1 Dior sneakers, as well as A$2,690 (£1,445) for three pairs of Nike Air Jordan 1 sneakers in various colours.

After receiving the shoes, the man told the Vcat that he noticed ""defects"" and contacted the seller for a refund - but did not receive a reply and went on to contact the teen's father.

He claims the boy's father accompanied him to local authenticators, who immediately recognised the teen as a ""fraudster and scam artist"" by name. The teen and his father disputed that the shoes were ""unauthentic"" and that the store used to check the sneakers was authorised to authenticate them.

The seller's father also told the tribunal that he only became involved in the situation to ""protect the safety of his family"" after his son was chased through a shopping centre.

Dismissing the claim in December, Vcat member Katherine Metcalf said that the father's involvement was not enough to suggest that he was responsible for the refund, and that the agreement was between the man and the student only.

But as the seller was underage when the shoes were sold, he was not legally able to enter into a contract or liable to make any refunds under Victorian state law.

""Had the agreement been entered into when [the seller] was 18 years old the result might have been different,"" Ms Metcalf wrote in her reasons for the dismissal.","Melbourne man denied A$30,000 refund after purchasing 'fake' shoes from teenGetty ImagesDior and Nike collaborated in 2020 to release the limited-edition sneakersA Melbourne man who spent nearly 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,100) on shoes he now believes to be fake has had his case thrown out by a tribunal.

By Mark Savage BBC Music Correspondent

Annie Reid

Tyla's music is rooted in the South African dancefloor culture of Kwaito and Amapiano

Sometimes, one song is all you need. And in 2023, Tyla found hers.

The South African singer is a picture of cool confidence on Water, a hypnotically seductive summer anthem that's become her breakout hit.

""As soon as I finished it, I was like, 'Ay, this song, it's too much',"" says the 21-year-old.

""I found myself re-playing it, over and over and over again. Usually artists, when they hear their own song too many times, they get tired of it. But I never got tired of Water.""

Her instincts were right. Water hit the top five in dozens of countries, and ended 2023 as the most-streamed Afrobeats song on Spotify. In the US, Tyla became the first South African solo artist to enter the Billboard charts in 55 years; and ended the year with a Grammy nomination for best African music performance.

The success has also earned her fourth place on the BBC's Sound Of 2024 list - which predicts the artists who'll dominate the next 12 months in music.

""I'm over the moon,"" she smiles on a Zoom call from Los Angeles.

""With things like this and the Grammys, I'm super grateful and blessed and happy that I'm able to be amongst all the other artists. All the greats!""

So, one song is all you need. But if Tyla has her way, Water is just the first drop of an oncoming flood.

""My goal has always been the same and it's to be one of the world's biggest pop stars,"" she says.

""I'm a huge dreamer, very passionate, and somehow I always believed that this was going to come to me.""

Epic / Fax Records

The singer has been whisked around the world since the success of Water

Born and bred in Johannesburg, and of Indian, Zulu, Mauritian and Irish descent, Tyla Laura Seethal knew she wanted to be a singer from the moment she performed (How Much Is) That Doggie In The Window in her school assembly.

""I was so small but I loved it,"" she recalls. ""When I sang, my gran was screaming there in the crowd!""

Soon, she was spending her spare time auditioning for musicals, making up songs and uploading Justin Bieber covers to YouTube.

She wasn't allowed to use social media but, when her father's back was turned, she'd sneak off with his phone to post music on a secret Instagram account, and message it to Drake and DJ Khaled.

They never responded, but one of the videos caught the attention of a photographer called Garth von Glehn, who emailed the teenager offering to manage her.

Tyla thought it was a scam and ignored it for weeks... but she couldn't stop thinking about it.

Eventually, she arranged a meeting (with her parents in tow) and von Glehn set up Tyla's first recording session.

""I ended up going to the studio every weekend in my last year of school. By the end of the year, I told my parents that I wanted to do this full time.

""Then there was another story I had to deal with.""

'A lot of crying'

Tyla's parents were not happy. They wanted her to stay in education. She reluctantly enrolled to study mining engineering and, at one point, considered joining her father in ""a boring nine-to-five job, working with money"".

Their reasoning was solid - no South African artist had ever achieved success as a global pop artist - but Tyla had a counter-argument.

""I really looked up to Rihanna, because she came from outside America and just dominated the industry,"" she says. And if a girl from Barbados could do it, why not her?

After ""a lot of convincing and a lot of crying"", her parents gave her a year to break into the industry. If she didn't succeed, she had to go back to school.

""And I'm still on my gap year now!""

Epic / Fax Records

The singer wants to be at the forefront of a wave of South African music

Tyla released her debut single, Getting Late, in 2019, casually creating a new genre in the process.

Called Popiano, it's essentially a more streamlined, hook-heavy variant of Amapiano - the popular South African sound that blends house music with reggae, jazz and trunk-rattling kwaito bass lines.

""Amapiano really felt like me, being a South African girl,"" she explains. ""But I also love pop and R&B so I wanted to mix that influence with sounds from home. It came together very naturally.""

Showcasing her soulful, intimate delivery over a shimmering shaker-and-snare groove, Getting Late put Tyla on an upward trajectory in South Africa - but the song lacked a music video, and Tyla lacked the resources to shoot one.

Undeterred, she begged, borrowed and called in favours to make it happen. Her manager became the director, her best friend was the stylist, but the goal was still ""to make the best video South Africa has ever seen"".

""All independent, no money from other people - and when we dropped it, like we just saw the numbers fly. It changed my life.""

Epic / Fax Records

The video for Getting Late was shot on a shoestring - but has been watched 7.7 million times

She's not exaggerating.

Getting Late triggered an international record label billing war. Legendary music executive Sylvia Rhone - who has worked with Missy Elliot, AC/DC, Erykah Badu and Travis Scott - even put up a billboard in Johannesburg to show her commitment.

""A whole billboard with my face, saying, 'Love, Sylvia Rhone from Epic',"" she recalls, still slightly awestruck.

But what really swung the deal was Rhone's promise of creative freedom, ""which was very important to me, because I didn't want to have to change my sound in order to break internationally"".

Suddenly, Tyla was leaving South Africa for the first time, touring with Chris Brown and dropping a series of sultry, pneumatic dance anthems.

Her music lives in the tantalising moments where attraction and temptation collide.

On the boisterous Overdue, she's harbouring a secret crush. The agitated beats of Been Thinking capture the anxious moment where she confesses her feelings.

""I read a lot of teen romance when I was younger, and I love those type of stories,"" she explains. ""It's all very fun and young.""

Water is where the passion boils over, as she guides a man back to her bedroom and instructs: ""Make me sweat, make me hotter / Make me lose my breath, make me water.""

The lyrics were inspired by Aaliyah's Rock The Boat - another bedroom anthem with an aquatic double-entendre - but the sound is all hers, with rattling log drums and South African slang phrases like Hayibo.

It became a phenomenon on TikTok, where million of fans copied Tyla's steamy Bacardi-style dance moves, which she accentuates by pouring a bottle of water down her back.

That trend spawned a craze of its own - where women would sit next to their boyfriends and play the song's opening bars. If they leaned in to catch a glimpse of Tyla's video, they faced all manner of shame and scorn.

The singer takes no responsibility for any subsequent break-ups.

""I'm not a part of all of this!"" she laughs.

Epic / Fax Records

The singer made her live debut at Milan Fashion Week last year

The song has taken her around the world, onto the stages and TV shows she dreamt of as a child. She made her live debut at Milan fashion week, and sat next to Kim Kardashian at Dolce and Gabbana's Fall/Winter show.

Ciara, Normani, Jack Harlow and BTS member Kim Tae-hyung (aka V) have all been in touch - but her mind was truly blown when Janet Jackson started performing Water as a mash-up with What Have You Done For Me Lately on her US tour.

""I was like, 'What the heck!' And then she DM'd me and she was like, 'Congratulations, stay blessed',"" Tyla says.

""I was just star-struck. I couldn't believe Janet Jackson took the time to even say anything, you know? It's crazy.""

Tyla's bid for world domination is going to plan, then. And she's ready to follow up Water with her self-titled debut album in March.

""I feel like people are going to be so surprised, like, 'Where did this girl come from?',"" she says,

""So I'm very excited because when I listen back to the album, I'm like, the people are not ready!""

Her fanbase is only going to grow in 2024 - but Tyla's biggest supporter, dating all the way back to school assembly, is still her grandmother Ivy.

""She loves it! She watches all my performances,"" laughs the singer.","BBC Sound of 2024: South Africa's Tyla says 'people are not ready' for debut albumBy Mark Savage BBC Music CorrespondentAnnie ReidTyla's music is rooted in the South African dancefloor culture of Kwaito and AmapianoSometimes, one song is all you need.

Ana Ofelia Murguía won a lifetime achievement award at Mexico's 2011 Ariel film awards ceremony

Ana Ofelia Murguía, the Mexican actress who voiced great-grandmother Mama Coco in the Oscar-winning Disney Pixar animation Coco, has died aged 90.

She had a key part in the film about a Mexican boy who crosses to the Land of the Dead, uncovering family secrets while trying to become a musician.

The movie highlights the Day of the Dead and celebrates Mexico's culture.

Its National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature said her career was ""vital for the performing arts of Mexico"".

One of Coco's most memorable moments was the scene where Mama Coco and her great-grandson Miguel sing Remember Me together.

He sings: ""For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart,"" and she joins in to sing: ""Until you're in my arms again... Remember me.""

The film is set during the Day of the Dead festival held each year in Latin American countries, including Mexico, celebrating the cycle of life and death.

Big parades are held and people often paint their faces to look like skulls, remembering friends and family who have died and passed into the afterlife.

""With deep sadness we regret the sensitive death of the leading actress Ana Ofelia Murguía, who was part of the stable cast of the National Theater Company of Mexico, and whose artistic career was vital for the performing arts of Mexico,"" the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature added.

Born in Mexico in 1933, Murguía won a special lifetime achievement Golden Ariel award in 2011 at a ceremony recognising the best of the Mexican cinema industry.

She shared the prize, for her career spanning more than 40 years in stage, film and television, with director and writer Jorge Fons.

She also won best supporting actress at the Ariel awards in 1979, 1986 and 1996 for films including 1994's La Reina de la Noche (The Queen of the Night), about a female cabaret artist who remakes her career in Mexico after leaving Berlin following an incident with the Nazis.

Celebrating Coco's double Oscar win in 2018 for best animated film and best original song, one of its producers, Lee Unkrich, said his biggest thanks went to Mexico and that the film could not have existed without its ""endlessly beautiful culture and traditions"".

Reuters

A long list of people associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is expected to be made public in the coming days.

The disclosures may throw new light on the sex trafficking network directed by Epstein, who died in 2019, and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.

The disgraced millionaire mixed with high-profile figures from the worlds of politics, business and royalty.

A judge ordered the court documents in a lawsuit linked to Maxwell must be unsealed.

There are 187 mentions of ""J Doe"" in the court papers, and many of these will now be given their real names.

Why are these names being made public?

The identities are being revealed under a settled lawsuit against Maxwell, the daughter of a British media tycoon.

She is serving a 20-year prison term for the crimes she committed with Epstein.

The defamation lawsuit was brought by Virginia Giuffre, one of Maxwell's accusers, and at the time the names were kept secret under a court-ordered seal.

But last month a judge in New York ruled these could now come to light.

What did the judge say about the names?

Judge Loretta Preska noted that many of the individuals named in the lawsuit have already been publicly identified by the media or in Maxwell's criminal trial.

She added that many others ""did not raise an objection"" to the release of the documents.

Some of the names on the list will remain sealed, including those belonging to child victims, the judge said in her ruling.

And some individuals may have appeared more than once under different Doe numbers, so the exact number of names to emerge is unknown.

Holly Baltz, investigations editor at the Palm Beach Post, told CNN on Tuesday that new details may be revealed.

Even if the names on the list turn out to be already known, she said, new light may be shed on the exact nature of their relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.

Whose names may be on the Epstein list?

They will be a mixture of people accused of wrongdoing, people making these accusations, and others who were potential witnesses to crimes.

There could be employees of Epstein or people who visited his home or went on his private plane.

Prince Andrew is expected to be on the list. The court filings include 40 documents of evidence from a woman who has made accusations against the prince.

Johanna Sjoberg claimed Prince Andrew groped her breast while sitting on a couch inside Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001.

Buckingham Palace has previously said the allegations are ""categorically untrue"".

Last year, the prince paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a lawsuit she filed claiming that he sexually abused her when she was 17 years old.

He said he had never met Ms Giuffre and denied her allegations.

Will Bill Clinton be on the Epstein list?

The former US president is mentioned more than 50 times in the court documents, according to ABC News. But there is no implication of any illegality.

He travelled on Epstein's plane on humanitarian trips to Africa in the early 2000s and at the time praised Epstein as a committed philanthropist.

Mr Clinton's team have previously said that he cut ties with Epstein before the financier came under investigation. They have in the past said he knows nothing about Epstein's crimes.

Many of his mentions in these court filings relate to Ms Giuffre's unsuccessful attempts to make the former president testify about his relationship with Epstein, says ABC.

Who is Jeffrey Epstein?

Epstein, a millionaire known to mix with high-profile figures like Prince Andrew, died in jail in 2019.

His death, as he awaited federal sex-trafficking charges, was ruled to be a suicide by the New York medical examiner.

He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of underage girls for sex. He pleaded not guilty.","Jeffrey Epstein list: What to expect from court filings unsealed in New YorkReutersA long list of people associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is expected to be made public in the coming days.

By Max Matza BBC News

Claudine Gay served as Harvard president for just six months

Harvard University's president has resigned after facing allegations of plagiarism and criticism over her comments about antisemitism on campus.

Claudine Gay has faced mounting pressure to step down in recent weeks.

In a letter announcing her resignation, she said it was in the ""best interests"" of the university for her to step down.

""It has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigour,"" she said.

""This is not a decision I came to easily. Indeed, it has been difficult beyond words,"" Dr Gay wrote, adding that her resignation would allow Harvard to ""focus on the institution rather than any individual"".

She said she had been subjected to personal threats and ""racial animus"".

The 53-year-old served as president for six months and was the first black person, and only the second woman, to be appointed to lead the Ivy League university. Her tenure was the shortest in its 388-year history.

During a tense congressional hearing last month, Dr Gay said calls for the killing of Jews were abhorrent. She added, however, that it would depend on the context whether such comments would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment.

That comment prompted a widespread backlash and she later apologised in an interview with the university's student newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret,"" Dr Gay said.

Dozens of politicians and some high-profile alumni called for her to step down over the comments.

But nearly 700 staff members rallied behind her in a letter and the university said she would keep her job despite the controversy.

Watch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocide

But since then US media outlets have unearthed several instances of alleged plagiarism in her academic record. Harvard's board investigated the allegations last month, and found two published papers that required additional citation.

The board, however, said that she did not violate standards for research misconduct.

More claims that Dr Gay failed to properly cite academic sources emerged just hours before she resigned on Tuesday, and were published anonymously in the conservative Washington Free Beacon newspaper.

The university's governing Harvard Corporation said in a statement that Dr Gay would resume her faculty position after resigning.

""We thank President Gay for her deep and unwavering commitment to Harvard and to the pursuit of academic excellence,"" it said.

""While President Gay has acknowledged missteps and has taken responsibility for them, it is also true that she has shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks,"" the statement added.

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls,"" the corporation said. ""We condemn such attacks in the strongest possible terms. The search for a new president of the university will begin in due course.""

Dr Gay is the second university official to resign following the 5 December congressional hearing.

Former University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill resigned just days later after an angry backlash. A donor also withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments.","Claudine Gay resigns as Harvard University presidentBy Max Matza BBC NewsReutersClaudine Gay served as Harvard president for just six monthsHarvard University's president has resigned after facing allegations of plagiarism and criticism over her comments about antisemitism on campus.

By Graeme Baker BBC News

BBC

Passengers escape as the jet engine continues to spark

First came the shock, as the Airbus A350 carrying 379 people collided with a second plane while landing in Tokyo.

Then came heat and smoke as the jet sped along the runway in flames.

Then survival instinct kicked in, as people scrambled to flee a cabin filling with fumes, knowing that lives depended on the next few seconds.

That all on Japan Airlines flight 516 escaped is extraordinary. Experts say a flawless evacuation and new technology played a large part in their survival.

Watch: Moment plane turns into fireball as it lands on runway

Those on board the second plane, a smaller coastguard aircraft due to deliver aid to quake victims, were not as fortunate. Five were killed and the pilot is seriously injured.

Investigators are piecing together what happened at 17:47 local time (08:47 GMT) at Haneda airport, and why two planes could have been on the runway at the same time.

For now, videos and statements from passengers paint a picture of a few minutes of terror, then disbelief at what they had lived through.

Swede Anton Deibe, 17, a passenger, described the chaos after impact as the Airbus A350 lumbered to a halt on the runway.

""The entire cabin was filled with smoke within minutes,"" he told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.

""The smoke in the cabin stung like hell. It was a hell.

""We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them.

""We had no idea where we were going so we just run out into the field. It was chaos.""

He, his parents and his sister managed to escape the wreckage unharmed.

Smoke fills the cabin as passengers prepare to flee

Satoshi Yamake, a 59-year-old passenger, said he felt the airplane had ""tilted to the side and felt a big bump"" in the initial collision.

Another unnamed passenger described a ""bump, like the aircraft was colliding with something when touching down. I saw a spark outside the window and the cabin was filled with smoke"".

A third reported to Kyodo News he felt ""a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed"".

Snippets of those moments were caught on phones.

Some passengers filmed the red glow from a still sparking engine as the plane came to a halt. Another took footage inside, a miasma of smoke quickly obscuring the camera lens as passengers shouted and cabin crew tried to direct their next moves.

A female passenger said it had been dark on board as the fire intensified after landing.

""It was getting hot inside the plane, and I thought, to be honest, I wouldn't survive,"" she told the Japanese broadcaster NHK.

According to another passenger, the escape plan was made more difficult as only one set of doors were used. ""An announcement said doors in the back and middle could not be opened. So everyone disembarked from the front,"" he said.

Watch: Passengers clamber down emergency slide after plane fire

Images and video show the moment people began to jump down the airliner's inflatable slides - some tumbling in their effort to get away from a now burning cabin, and running to greater safety.

No one appears to be holding their bulky carry-on luggage - a major factor in how quickly a cabin can be cleared.

Alex Macheras, an aviation analyst, told the BBC that the crew ""were able to initiate a textbook evacuation"" in the crucial first few minutes after impact.

The fire was ""isolated to one area"" of the Airbus A350 for the initial 90 seconds, allowing them a brief window to get everyone out.

He said the crew were clearly able to understand which doors were away from the flames, which is why pictures show not all the exits were opened for people to escape through.

He added that passengers can slow things down in panic - for example by trying to grab their bags from lockers.

The Airbus A350 is one of the first commercial jets to be made of composite, carbon-fibre materials - which appear to have stood up well to the initial collision and the resulting fire.

All of this was achieved as the fire was quickly spreading to engulf the plane. Video footage showed firefighters battling to contain the blaze, as the plane's fuselage began to break in two.

Mr Yamake, the passenger, said for all of the chaos, it took about five minutes for everyone to get out. ""I saw that the fire had spread in about 10, 15 minutes,"" he added.

Tsubasa Sawada, 28, said he could ""only say it was a miracle, we could have died"".

It took several hours for the fire to finally be extinguished. Fourteen passengers and crew were treated for minor injuries.

Passengers were already trying to come to terms with that they had just lived through, telling their friends and loved ones that they were okay, and preparing for what was to come.

Mr Sawada had one question. ""I want to know why this happened,"" he said, adding that he did not plan to get on another plane until he got the answer.","Japan jet crash: Passengers describe chaos inside flight 516By Graeme Baker BBC NewsBBCPassengers escape as the jet engine continues to sparkFirst came the shock, as the Airbus A350 carrying 379 people collided with a second plane while landing in Tokyo.

By Flora Drury BBC News

Riverdale Police Department

Kai Zhuang is alleged to be a victim of cyber kidnapping

A Chinese foreign exchange student has been found freezing but alive in the US after his parents were extorted out of tens of thousands of dollars in a ""cyber kidnapping"" scam.

Kai Zhuang was discovered ""very cold and scared"" in a tent in rural Utah, Riverdale Police said in a statement.

The 17-year-old is believed to have isolated himself after being manipulated by the kidnappers.

His parents were then tricked into paying around $80,000 (£62,600).

Zhuang is one of a number of foreign students targeted by so-called cyber kidnappers in the US recently, Riverdale Police added in their statement.

Police believe Kai was being controlled by the kidnappers as early as 20 December, when he was seen by officers in Provo, Utah, carrying camping equipment.

Those officers arranged for him to be returned to Riverdale - where he lived with a host family - out of concerns for his safety. He did not mention any threats at the time, however.

Police were then contacted on 28 December by the school he was attending, which had been contacted by his parents in China.

Kai's parents had told school officials they had been sent a ransom demand and a picture of their son indicating he was abducted.

According to police, victims of cyber kidnapping are convinced to isolate themselves, and even take pictures to make it appear they are being held captive - despite the kidnappers not being present. Instead, the victim is monitored through Facetime or Skype.

Both the victim and their families are then convinced the other will be harmed if they do not comply.

But despite the kidnappers not being with Kai, police in Utah still feared for his safety, explaining the state's December temperatures meant there was a risk he could ""freeze to death overnight"".

Kai was checked for hypothermia after being found on Sunday

Kai was eventually found around 25 miles (40km) north of Riverdale, near Brigham City, in a tent with ""no heat source"" on Sunday.

He had limited food and water, a heat blanket and a sleeping bag - as well as several phones which police suspect were used to carry out the kidnapping.","Kai Zhuang: Chinese teen found alive in US after 'cyber kidnapping'By Flora Drury BBC NewsRiverdale Police DepartmentKai Zhuang is alleged to be a victim of cyber kidnappingA Chinese foreign exchange student has been found freezing but alive in the US after his parents were extorted out of tens of thousands of dollars in a ""cyber kidnapping"" scam.

Seven-year-old Aden Wentz and his nine-year-old sister Elianna (Ellie) were found dead at a home in Colorado

The ex-husband of a woman facing extradition to the US accused of murdering her two children says he was ""devastated"" to learn they had died.

In a statement, Kevin Wentz said he and Kimberlee Singler had been involved in a contentious divorce.

His nine-year-old daughter Elianna and seven-year-old son Aden were found dead at a home in Colorado.

Ms Singler, 35, was arrested in London on Monday and faces extradition on charges including murder.

As well as the two counts of first degree murder, she is also charged with one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said she had been arrested in the Kensington area ""without incident"" and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday for an extradition hearing.

She was remanded in custody and will next appear in court on 29 January.

Her daughter and son were found dead on 19 December, along with her 11-year-old daughter who was injured, US police said.

They issued a warrant for her arrest a week later.

In a press release last week, Colorado Springs Police Department said it first responded to a 911 call reporting a burglary at a Colorado Springs residence at 00:29 local time on 19 December.

By Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman BBC News

Models pose with a BYD car in Japan

Chinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector.

BYD said on Monday it had sold a record 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the final quarter of 2023.

It marked the first quarter its battery-only sales have outpaced Tesla's. The US-based firm has seen demand slow as borrowing costs climb.

However, for the whole of 2023, Mr Musk's Tesla still sold more.

On Tuesday, Tesla said it delivered a record 484,500 electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023 and 1.8 million for the year as a whole.

The end-of-year performance was better than analysts had expected, as sales rose 20% from the same period in 2022 and picked up pace from earlier in 2023. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described the quarter as a ""clear win"" for Tesla.

But it fell short of earlier hopes. Last January, Mr Musk said that Tesla had the potential to achieve two million deliveries in 2023.

The firm cut prices repeatedly to try to woo buyers.

The milestone achieved by BYD is a reminder of the challenges facing the firm, which helped to launch the electric vehicle industry.

""As BYD has accelerated into the fast lane, it's fresh evidence of just how competitive the EV market has become and how hard it will be for Tesla to swerve back to head the pack,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

For the year as a whole, Shenzen-based BYD sold more than 3 million so-called-new energy vehicles (NEVs), which includes battery-only vehicles and hybrids.

Almost 1.6 million of its total sales were battery-only vehicles, the firm said.

BYD's chief executive Wang Chuanfu co-founded BYD with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995.

The company made a name for itself as a manufacturer of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports.

It started selling its shares on the stock market in 2002 and diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company.

Since 2008 BYD has counted veteran US investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder.

Analysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money.

Many of BYD's competitors rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries.","China’s BYD overtakes Tesla's electric car sales in last quarter of 2023By Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman BBC NewsReutersModels pose with a BYD car in JapanChinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector.

Jenni Hermoso outside court on Tuesday

Spanish World Cup-winning footballer Jenni Hermoso has testified to a Madrid court that a kiss from former football federation president Luis Rubiales was ""not consensual"".

He grabbed Ms Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips after the World Cup final last year.

A judge will now decide whether Mr Rubiales should be tried for sexual assault and coercion.

""All is in the hands of justice, that's all I can say,"" she told reporters.

The former federation chief denies the allegations.

Ms Hermoso, Spain's top scorer, testified to the court for around two and a half hours, and according to Spanish media she told the judge the kiss was ""unexpected and at no time consensual"".

Her evidence was said to have reiterated testimony given several months ago to prosecutors that was then leaked to Spanish TV,

The court is examining evidence including CCTV footage to decide whether to take her criminal complaint of sexual assault and coercion to trial.

The kiss took place during the medal ceremony in Sydney on 20 August last year, following Spain's win over England.

A statement issued shortly after the final that was attributed to Ms Hermoso had indicated the kiss had been consensual. But she later complained of being pressured by officials of the Spanish football federation to put her name to the statement.

Mr Rubiales is being investigated for possible coercion over his role in the alleged pressure on Ms Hermoso.

Jorge Vilda, the coach who led the team to World Cup glory before being sacked shortly afterwards, is also being investigated along with Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera, both federation executives.

Ms Hermoso said she did not want to be kissed and that she felt that she had been a ""victim of assault"". Under Spanish law a kiss without consent can be deemed a form of sexual assault.

Mr Rubiales has always maintained the kiss was a ""consensual peck"" but in the wake of the incident he was forced to resign as president of the Spanish football federation.

Prosecutors opened an investigation and last September he was barred by investigating judge Francisco de Jorge from going within 200m (650ft) of the footballer.

In a statement to prosecutors leaked to Spanish TV in October, Ms Hermoso said that ""clearly I felt disrespected"" as a player and a person.

""I didn't do anything to land myself in that situation... how could I expect it in that scenario of a medal ceremony at a World Cup final?""

Ms Hermoso, 33, announced on Monday that she was changing clubs. She is leaving Mexico's Pachuca, where she has played since 2022, for Tigres UANL, the country's most successful women's side.

Her role in the controversy has made her a prominent public figure beyond the football world.","Spain's Hermoso testifies World Cup kiss was not consensualBy Ido Vock in London & Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid BBC NewsShutterstockJenni Hermoso outside court on TuesdaySpanish World Cup-winning footballer Jenni Hermoso has testified to a Madrid court that a kiss from former football federation president Luis Rubiales was ""not consensual"".

Mickey's Mouse Trap

It's Mickey, but not as you've ever seen him before.

A trailer for a slasher film, featuring a masked killer dressed as Mickey Mouse, was released on 1 January, the day that Disney's copyright on the earliest versions of the cartoon character expired in the US.

""We wanted the polar opposite of what exists,"" the movie's producer said.

A new Mickey-inspired horror game, showing the rodent covered with blood stains, also dropped on the same day.

Steamboat Willie, a 1928 short film featuring early non-speaking versions of Mickey and Minnie, entered the public domain in the US on New Year's Day.

It means cartoonists, novelists and filmmakers can now rework and use the earliest versions of Mickey and Minnie.

Disney

In fact, anyone can use those versions without permission or cost.

Creatives have been quick to take advantage of the new rules, with a trailer (contains violent scenes) for a Mickey horror film dropping on the same day.

In the horror comedy thriller, called Mickey's Mouse Trap, a young woman is thrown a surprise birthday party in an amusement arcade - but things quickly take a turn for the worse when she and her friends encounter a knife-wielding murderer in a Mickey costume.

""A place for fun, a place for friends, a place for hunting. The mouse is out,"" the trailer screams in red text.

""People need to not take it too seriously, we made a ridiculously fun movie,"" said Simon Phillips, who wrote and produce the film and plays the man behind the Mickey mask.

Mr Phillips told the BBC that ""if you put Mickey into a family movie, you don't cover new ground"".

""In order to flip the coin, you have to come up with something that's the polar opposite of what already exists,"" he said.

The film itself does not have a confirmed release date but is expected to be out this March.

Not to be outdone, a new video game has been unveiled, also featuring the 1928 version of Mickey.

Game studio Nightmare Forge Games said the game, titled Infestation 88, is a survival horror game in which an outbreak of vermin turns into something more sinister.

At the start of the trailer, a man is heard saying nervously: ""I thought it was just rodents, but there's something else in here.""

A huge, blood splattered Mickey then pops up on screen, while mice scurry around him.

A spokesperson from Nightmare Forge Games told the BBC that Steamboat Willie entering the public domain ""allowed us to include our own derivation of the film's starring character in our game, which fits perfectly as an antagonist causing an infestation"".

Things took a dark turn in Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey

Mickey's not the first childhood character to be given the horror movie treatment.

When Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain, the loveable bear was turned into the R-rated horror film Blood and Honey, which was one of last year's worst-rated films.

US copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on 1 January 2024.

Disney has faced losing the copyright over its original cartoons several times in the past.

The characters were first expected to go into the public domain in 1984, but Congress extended the term by 20 years.

Before the next expiry date came up in 2004, another 20-year extension was passed.

Disney's efforts to protect its characters have even led to the law being dubbed ""the Mickey Mouse Protection Act"". But the moment finally came, and was hailed as being ""deeply symbolic"" by experts.

The company still separately holds a trademark on Mickey as a brand identifier and a corporate mascot. That means there are still limits on how the public can use these images.

And Disney has insisted that more modern versions of Mickey are still covered by copyright.","Mickey Mouse horror film unveiled as copyright endsBy Noor Nanji Culture reporterMickey's Mouse TrapIt's Mickey, but not as you've ever seen him before.

BBC/TONY JOLLIFFE

The skull of a colossal sea monster that was unearthed from the Jurassic Coast has gone on public display.

The 2m-long fossil belongs to a pliosaur - one of the most fearsome predators the planet has ever seen.

Sir David Attenborough investigated the discovery in a BBC film which aired on New Year's Day.

The public can see the 150-million-year-old marine reptile at the Etches Collection in Kimmeridge in Dorset, close to where the beast was found.

The rest of its skeleton may still be entombed in the crumbling cliffs. The hope is it may eventually be recovered.

BBC Studios

The whole excavation was conducted on ropes high above the Dorset beach

The snout of the pliosaur was discovered by a fossil enthusiast on a beach near Kimmeridge Bay.

The rest of its skull was extracted from half-way down a fast-eroding cliff face by a team precariously dangling from ropes.

Steve Etches led the effort to remove and prepare the fossil.

It's now being unveiled at the museum that bears his name, sitting alongside the Jurassic fossils he's spent a lifetime collecting.

""It's going to be impressive, especially when children come, because they'll come in and see it face-on - which should have the required effect,"" he told BBC News.

The pliosaur skull is one of the most complete specimens ever found and it is exquisitely preserved.

It doesn't take much imagination to see that this would have been the ultimate killing machine.

Its enormous crocodile-like jaw is packed with 130 razor sharp teeth, and cavernous holes on either side of the skull would have been filled with huge muscles.

Researchers estimate that its bite force would have been in the same range as a T. Rex - earning the pliosaur the nickname of ""sea rex"".

Growing to 10-12m in length, the ancient reptile would have powered itself through the ocean using four huge paddle-like limbs.

So, despite its bulk, it would have moved quickly.

Passing prey would have been killed with a single bite, and then gulped straight down - scientists think this monster didn't bother to chew its food.

""Pliosaurs were the top of the food chain,"" said Steve Etches,

""They'd even feed on their own kind, because in the collections we've got pliosaur bones with pliosaur bite marks in them.""

As well as public interest in this prehistoric beast, researchers are also keen to get up close with the fossil.

It has features not seen on other pliosaurs, including a high head crest, which suggests it may be a species new to science.

And what about the rest of the pliosaur's body?

If the skeleton is still in the Kimmeridge cliff clay, with the coastline rapidly eroding, it really is a race against time.

Steve Etches wants to get it out, before it's lost to the sea forever.

By Kelly Ng and Simon Fraser in Singapore and London

Watch: First pictures of plane on fire on Tokyo runway

A Japan Airlines plane burst into flames after a collision with a smaller coastguard aircraft on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport.

All 379 passengers and crew on board were evacuated, but five of the six crew on the coastguard plane died, police said. The captain was injured.

Flames engulfed the airliner after it landed, skidding on the blazing runway.

Fire crews spent hours dousing the blaze. The airliner came from Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido.

Air safety experts have praised the crew for safely evacuating all the passengers. All four of Haneda's runways were closed after the incident, disrupting travel plans for thousands of passengers.

Japan Airlines Flight 516 had departed from Sapporo's New Chitose airport at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and landed at Haneda shortly before 18:00.

Video showed it bursting into flames as it sped down the runway after landing.

""I felt a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed,"" one passenger told Kyodo news agency. ""I saw sparks outside the window and the cabin filled with gas and smoke.""

Passengers escaped via an evacuation slide and ran across the tarmac to safety, footage and photos showed.

Officials said the flight crew had reported no problems before landing. Exchanges with flight controllers are under investigation.

What caused the collision remains unclear. The coastguard said an investigation was under way to establish how and at what time the two aircraft came into contact with each other.

A Japan Airlines statement said flight JL516 had been ""involved in a collision with a Japan coastguard aircraft during its landing at Haneda Airport, resulting in a fire on the runway"".

""We want to assure you that all passengers and crew on our flight were safely evacuated. Our thoughts and prayers are with the deceased members of the Japan coastguard.""

The coastguard aircraft - a De Havilland Dash 8 turboprop - was heading to help with rescue and relief efforts following Monday's earthquake in Ishikawa. It was one of four planes on a mission to the quake site.

TV footage showed several fire trucks at the scene as smoke and flames billowed from the Airbus. Footage from inside the aircraft showed passengers surrounded by thick smoke. The passenger plane effectively burnt down to its fuselage.

One woman posted a picture of a huge crowd watching the scene unfold. ""I was on board. I'm safe. Thank goodness,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

But within hours of the blaze, police in Tokyo had confirmed reports that the five coastguard crew members had died and said the pilot was severely injured.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the authorities were trying to make sure the accident did not impede deliveries of earthquake relief supplies.

""This is a great regret as the crew members performed their duties with a strong sense of mission and responsibility for the victims of the disaster area,"" he said.

At least 14 of the passengers and crew who were taken off the Japan Airlines flight suffered minor injuries, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing fire officials.

Flights at Haneda - one of two international airports serving Japan's capital - were grounded and many diverted to other airports in Japan while emergency services tackled the fire. All but one runway - where the collision took place - opened later on Tuesday evening, the transport ministry said.

It is the first major accident involving an A350, one of a new breed of aircraft built largely of advanced materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced plastic. Airbus is sending a team of specialists to assist in the investigation in Japan.

There was also praise for the efforts of the Japan Airline crew and pilots.","Japan Airlines: Hundreds survive after plane bursts into flames on Tokyo runwayBy Kelly Ng and Simon Fraser in Singapore and LondonWatch: First pictures of plane on fire on Tokyo runwayA Japan Airlines plane burst into flames after a collision with a smaller coastguard aircraft on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport.

By William Park Features correspondent @williamhpark

While looks might matter for first impressions, there are other qualities that win people's hearts.

Considering the attention given to appearances, and how quickly we form – and stick to – a first impression, it would be easy to assume that looks are what matter most in finding love. But, while physical attraction is coveted, it might really be what's inside that counts.

Appearance and sexiness rank middling on surveys of people's preferred characteristics, with material successes, such as financial security and owning a nice house, among the least important attractive qualities.

Instead, traits like agreeableness, extraversion and intelligence score consistently higher than physical attraction as things that men and women in same-sex and different-sex couples look for in a partner.

In surveys like this, social-desirability bias – or our tendency to give answers which we think make us look good in the eyes of others – might be skewing the results, says Greg Webster, a psychology professor at the University of Florida in the US. This might mean that self-reported surveys present slightly skewed data, but even so, people typically say they prefer qualities like intelligence to looks.

But when presented with a real-life date do we still choose personality over looks?

According to Jess Alderson, co-founder of the dating app So Syncd, which requires users to complete a psychometric test to measure personality traits, we do. Of a sample of more than 1,000 users made available to BBC Future, almost 90% preferred personality over looks.

Measuring someone's personality can be tricky. Psychometric tests, which usually take the form of a questionnaire, have been used for decades in psychiatry as a way to quantify personality. (These tests tend to measure how much people agree with statements like ""I'm the life and soul of the party"".)

Psychologists often use the Big Five test, which measures people on five traits – openness to new experiences, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. These five traits are thought to be quite common, but the Big Five is not without criticism. Looking only at five traits presents quite a limited view of what makes people tick, says Webster.

While imperfect, psychometric tests can show similarities and differences between people, and can paint broad pictures of people's personalities. And some parts of our personalities do seem to be better indicators of how suitable we are for serious relationships.

Of the Big Five, agreeableness, which is an indicator of someone's interpersonal skills (or how caring and compassionate they are), plays a strong role for both sexes in the initial assessment of a date's desirability, is the strongest predictor of current and future relationship satisfaction , and the only significant predictor of relationship dissolution. For both men and women, physical attractiveness must be coupled with agreeableness to predict desire for a serious relationship.

Being a nice person is ""indispensable for harmonious long-term relationships"", says Webster. ""Agreeableness is kind of a necessity,"" he says, adding that entering into a relationship with someone you thought was unkind would be problematic.

Webster says that our perception of our own and other people's personalities are shaped by our frame of reference. More agreeable people, for example, tend to see other people as kind and friendly, and vice versa, and we are attracted to people who share similar values to us. It might be the case then that we match with people who have very similar personalities to ourselves.

Sociologists Terri Orbuch from the University of Michigan and Susan Sprecher from Illinois State University, both in the US, say qualities that relate to familiarity, such as how similar physically and genetically the other person is to us, how close they live to us, and whether we approve of their friends, explain why similarity is so important. Partners reporting high levels of similarity in the Big Five personality traits of conscientiousness and openness have a head start on other couples in their ability to problem solve and manage daily tasks.

What people want are partners who are socially, physically or financially dominant, but not necessarily towards their partner – Greg Webster

That we should seek partners who are familiar to us and share some of our personality traits, appearance, geography and social groups is ""the most basic principle of attraction"", agree psychologists Ellen Berscheid from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, US, and Harry Reid from the University of Rochester, New York in the US.

But some personality differences might be appealing too. We prefer being in teams whose levels of extraversion are opposite to ours, for example, which might bring different qualities out of us.

""It makes sense that we've evolved to be attracted to people who at least have a certain amount of differences to ourselves,"" says Alderson, whose app is more likely to match the profiles of people with complementary traits. ""We make a stronger team and would be more likely to survive. But again, you need that kind of intimacy that draws you together.""

The psychometric test used in the So Syncd dating app is not the same as the Big Five, but asks questions based on similar themes – such as how outgoing users are or if they build emotional connections easily. ""We pair couples who have just enough similarities to form a strong connection, and then just enough differences to create that spark of excitement,"" says Alderson. ""I would caveat this by saying that any personality type pairing can work and there are definitely advantages and challenges to each. If you are too similar, it can be a little bit boring. And then if you're too different, it can just not be that fun on a daily basis.""

In relationships, agreeableness coupled with other attractive traits can bring the best out of people, says Webster. In a study he co-authored with social psychologists Angela Bryan and Amanda Mahaffey, Webster looked at socially, physically and financially dominant people and the effect agreeableness had on their appeal.

All three of these types of dominance are attractive, the researchers say, as each offers a kind of protection or access to basic needs, like food and shelter, through to more desirable needs, like lavish lifestyles. But, dominance can be used for good and bad.

""We can think about dominance as being turned inward towards a relationship or dominance being focused outward away from the relationship,"" says Webster. ""What people want are partners who are socially, physically or financially dominant, but not necessarily towards their partner.""

Dominance mediated by agreeableness is an appealing combination, he adds. ""It's one thing if you're able to dominate other people, but are you willing to share those resources with your romantic partner?""

When it comes to finding the right match, says Webster, agreeableness accentuates the benefits of other parts of our personalities. It really could pay to be kind after all.

Consumers flock to health, finance and learning companies to reach their goals. These firms are well aware – and many are seizing the moment to profit.

Get fit. Improve mental health. Make a budget. Learn a language.

New year's resolutions provide an opportunity for brands to pitch consumers on products or services that will help them achieve their goals. Companies know there's revenue potential, especially in membership-based models; many say the start of the new year is an important time to attract new users whom they hope will convert to long-term active paying customers.

""There are specific spikes in demand for certain products around new year because of resolutions,"" says Neil Saunders, US-based managing director at GlobalData, a consulting firm.

If these subscription-based companies can manage the careful balancing act between spending on customer acquisition through discounts and promotions, while considering return on investments in the months to come, they can cash in on the people eager to spend on platforms, services and products that can bring them closer to success. The habits of US consumers serve as an example of how resolutions can be major commercial moments.

Analysts say the start of the new year is an important time for health-focused businesses. Nearly half of Americans polled in an October 2023 Forbes Health-OnePoll survey said they were prioritizing fitness in their new year's goals.

""People have been through the holiday season, they've probably been overindulging,"" says Saunders. ""They're now focused on new year's resolutions to do with wellness and losing weight.""

New York Sports Club, which operates chains of gyms and fitness facilities in the US – such as popular brands including its eponymous club, Lucille Roberts and Fhitting Room – says January is a critical time for customer acquisition, with new member sign-ups as high as two-times a typical month.

Kari Saitowitz, chief marketing and creative officer of New York Sports Club, says the club banks on the new year's period as new business driver: targets for new sign-ups are two-to-three times the goals for most other months. It's not necessarily a revenue play at first; the company offers discounted memberships for new joiners to get them through the door. Last year, New York Sports Club offered new members a $1 joining fee and complimentary membership for the first month.

The long-term profit lies in continued conversion. With the influx of sign-ups, New York Sports Club – and similar membership-based businesses – are hoping these new faces will go on to become loyal customers who pay the standard, higher monthly membership fee after joining on a discount.

""The idea is to get people started off with a really compelling offer for January… you've got to win them over month after month,"" says Saitowitz. At New York Sports Club, a key part of this is ensuring they have free orientation sessions with trainers. They must look at strategy for retention after the new year's rush, too: for instance, she says, the company is in the process of revamping its referral and incentive-based rewards programmes.

New York-based Talkspace – which works directly with consumers and employers to provide mental-health counselling – says January is a natural time for people to seek out therapy, especially after spending time with family or friends during the holidays.

""November and December are often very slow months for therapy. Clients have a lot going on as the holidays are happening,"" says Liz Colizza, director of research and programmes at Talkspace. ""January comes, and people start to look at their lives differently. Everyone takes a look at what the next year is going to hold.""

At the kick-off of a new year, the company has invested in resolution-related marketing to bring in users. Since 2018, Talkspace has organised ongoing brand campaigns with ambassador and American Olympian Michael Phelps, which help users set new year's intentions and prime them to continue throughout the year – which the mental-health company, too, hope leads to ongoing business. In January 2023, would-be users were encouraged to engage with an Instagram post from Phelps as part of a contest to win free therapy sessions.

""It's pretty common for us to have some sort of [theme] around, setting your intentions … thinking about your behaviour and what you want to do in the coming year,"" says Katelyn Watson, chief marketing officer at Talkspace. In Q1 2023, the platform reported a 34% increase in the number of therapy sessions covered by insurance, compared to the prior quarter.

January comes, and people start to look at their lives differently. Everyone takes a look at what the next year is going to hold – Liz Colizza

Personal-finance platforms often experience similar consumer interest during this time, says Jesse Mecham, founder and CEO of global digital budgeting platform YNAB. ""[With] gyms and personal finance, we share so many relations, where people know that they're not doing it right, and they could be doing better,"" he says.

YNAB is a subscription business, billed monthly or annually. The ""New Tear's bump"", as Mecham calls it, can result in around a 25-to-50% boost in new member sign-ups in January. The company typically increases its advertising spend in the lead-up to New Year's Day to capture more interest in the platform.

Similarly, Eric Dunn, CEO of personal-finance platform Quicken, says the company typically gets around 15% of its customers in January. New customer revenue, however, represents, only 10% of the company's revenue, with 90% coming from renewals. These re-ups can happen throughout the year, but are weighted more heavily around the first two calendar quarters, with Q1 being the largest renewal quarter, says Dunn.

As people also seek personal enrichment, Berlin-based language app Babbel sees an opportunity. ""New year's resolutions are a huge boon to language learning, as with so many self-improvement activities,"" says Julie Hansen, Babbel's US CEO and CRO.

The company offers price promotions around the new year, driving a ""significant boost in Q1"", with January being the peak month for US revenue and sales, says Franka Schuster, the company's principal corporate communications manager. Hansen adds, ""For Babbel, January is the largest month of the year by far.""

Duolingo, based in Pittsburgh, US, also offers a discount on its premium subscription only once per year: in January. Consequently, the new year's period is one of the company's biggest customer growth periods of the year, according to Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo's global communications director.

Equinox

Not every company that might see a boost from resolutions uses goals as a marketing tool, however. For global fitness-and-health company Equinox, 2024 marks the second year they are running an anti-new year's resolution campaign called ""We Don't Speak January"", in which they don't allow signups on the first of the year.

""Our members commit to being in our club every day, and so when we look at what the mainstream fitness industry is doing around [1 January] ... they're driving new year's resolutions and using that as a gimmick to sell memberships,"" says Jeff De Korte, chief marketing officer at Equinox. (Some people have criticised the move as a ""stunt"".)

Whatever way consumers receive the marketing approach, Equinox still sees strong member uptick for the remainder of the month – the company says in 2023, Equinox had its largest January sales month in history, approximately 20% higher than January sales prior to the pandemic. And due to the company's membership model of only year-long contracts – something De Korte says he believes promotes a long-term investment in wellness – this spike in sign-ups represents a full-year revenue boost.

Ultimately, despite the surge in resolution-related business early in the year, sustained revenue isn't a given. Companies that see mass sign-ups still must retain customers – especially as they drop off when giving up on their new year's goals. ""They're trying to lock customers in, because one of the problems with resolutions is people make them, they kind of stick to them in January and as the year goes on, they kind of fade into the background,"" says Saunders.","The businesses betting on new year's resolutionsBy Suman Bhattacharyya Features correspondentGetty ImagesFitness businesses are among the companies that see a bump in revenue around the New Year, as people set their goals (Credit: Getty Images)Consumers flock to health, finance and learning companies to reach their goals.

With tourists around the world behaving badly in their quest to get the perfect Insta shot, some destinations and tour operators are working to get visitors to go beyond the selfie.

It was nearly 10 years ago that Karthika Gupta's five-year-old son was knocked down in Yellowstone National Park by tourists clamouring to get a photo of themselves with the roaming bison in the background. But since the upsetting incident, Gupta, a photographer and writer, has only seen an increase in this kind of pushy behaviour in search of the perfect selfie.

On a trip to Sri Lanka just before the pandemic, she witnessed hordes of tourists jostling to get an Instagram-worthy shot of Coconut Tree Hill in Mirissa. While no one (that she saw) was injured, Gupta's enjoyment was zapped, and she was left frustrated that she was unable to fully see, let alone photograph, the lauded sunset.

Gupta's not against taking photos (she'd also hoped to get a few shots for her portfolio), but she cannot abide what she describes as a ""lack of consideration for others"". What was supposed to be a gorgeous, arresting sight was ruined by the rudeness of too many people trying to get a photo of the spectacular setting. ""It's not a beautiful memory,"" Gupta said of her time visiting one of Sri Lanka's most popular spots (at the time of publication, #MirissaSriLanka had more than 20,000 tags on Instagram)

Selfie culture isn't new, and neither is ""deviant behaviour"", according to Vanja Bogicevic, a clinical associate professor at the Tisch Center of Hospitality at New York University, who notes the latter has been around for a very long time. But with the rise of ""revenge travel"" and ""the fear of missing out"", overtourism – and selfie culture, a seemingly linked consequence – has accelerated since the pandemic, she explained.

Although some destinations are endeavouring to lure travellers to lesser-known attractions and regions – Bogicevic cites Amsterdam's efforts to migrate its red light district to the city's outskirts and Florence's attempt to draw travellers to less-familiar neighbourhoods – others, like Venice, can't seem to escape their bucket-list popularity to the detriment of the city's values and the chagrin of its locals.

Last month, a gondola meandering the canals of Venice capsized when a group of travellers from China refused to sit down and stop taking photos. It wasn't the first time a tourist caused mischief in Venice, and it likely won't be the last in the storied Italian city – or elsewhere.

Despite efforts from destinations around the world who long for tourists to stop and smell the proverbial flowers without necessarily capturing every second on camera, there are visitors who ""go against societal norms"", exhibiting behaviour that's ""disrespectful for the culture"", said Bogicevic.

Whether it's dressing inappropriately in religious settings (with selfies to prove it), posing in front of memorials or engaging in risky photo-taking behaviour (such as in Venice), this behaviour can be problematic for both residents and visitors. However, the prevalence of locals objecting to tourists behaving badly is on the rise, and they're voicing their concerns with authorities who are starting to take action.

Policymakers and governments are putting measures in place to restrict travel to certain bucket-list sites, limiting capacities or levying high fees for visitation. Some are even taking direct action against elaborate photo shoots and selfie-takers.

Two years ago, New Zealand adopted an innovative approach to combating selfie culture when it urged travellers to stop taking influencer-inspired photos at tourist hotspots and to share something new about their travels in the country instead. Last May, the tourism hotspot of Hallstatt, Austria, erected a wooden wall at its most popular selfie spot to block the view of the Alps in protest against noise pollution and traffic. (After a backlash on social media, it was removed.) And in autumn 2023, Vermont made headlines when it banned influencers who'd been coming in droves for pictures of the idyllic autumn foliage.

The challenge with selfies is when getting the picture becomes more important than breathing in the actual experience

In Big Sur, California, the Sustainable Movements Initiative, which promotes responsible behaviour along the iconic, Instagram-worthy Highway 1, isn't anti-selfie, said Rob O'Keefe, CEO & president of See Monterey, but it is aiming to get visitors to go beyond the selfie. ""The challenge with selfies is when getting the picture becomes more important than breathing in the actual experience,"" said O'Keefe, who hopes people will stop to revel in the views, recognising that a picture will not do them justice.

These policies can be useful, and Bogicevic adds that education and example-setting – by destinations and tour companies and even travel influencers – is also important, especially as some places may need the promotion as well as the resulting tourism dollars.

""If somebody's watching the influencer channel, and they are prompted to go to that destination, maybe it's the responsibility of the influencers to actually educate tourists [through their content]"", she said.

For some Gen X travellers, however, incessant selfie-taking will never be anything but a nuisance, much less an inspiration for future travel and trip planning. Gupta and her family, who live in Chicago, adore Yellowstone but they go during the winter now, when crowds are sparse. They regularly seek out destinations that are under the radar to avoid throngs of selfie-obsessed travellers who threaten to take away from their experience.

""I get annoyed that people refuse to put devices down and be in the moment,"" added Jeremy Harlan, a CNN producer (and Gen Xer) who lives in Denver, Colorado, and travels regularly for both work and leisure. ""If you're on a hike around Montserrat, just stop and look at the beauty with your eyes and burn it into your head. The iPhone 15 isn't coming close to replicating that image.""

I get annoyed that people refuse to put devices down and be in the moment

Selfie culture has ruined the cobblestone streets of Dumbo, Brooklyn, according to Allison Tick, an interior designer who identifies as a member of Gen X. Dumbo is the ""perfect example"" of how this ""phenomenon has gone too far"", said Tick, who points out how one entire street in the neighbourhood is now blocked off ""for selfies"". It's not a place she can enjoy any longer, and she says it's a shame. ""First of all, I know this just shows my age, but even the word selfie, I hate. You're just taking pictures of yourself.""

Or, you're taking pictures of yourself and a random stray cat and missing out on the essence of a truffle hunt experience you paid for and then complaining about it later, as was the case with one participant of Experience BellaVita, an independent tour operator in Italy. This ultimately led to the company implementing a new way for truffle hunting participants to ""immerse themselves in the moment"", explained Marino Cardelli, owner of Experience BellaVita.

Now, on truffle hunts in Abruzzo, Experience BellaVita's participants are given tools – truffle hunting hoes and treats for the truffle hunting dogs – so that they actively engage with the experience and don't reach for their devices so quickly. The idea, said Cardelli, is to discourage people from using their phones so they might have a ""more meaningful travel experience that goes beyond the superficiality of selfies"".

That said, Cardelli understands the desire to have a visual takeaway of the truffle hunt experience, which is why he's enlisted a professional photographer to document the experiences for travellers.

To encourage richer and more spontaneous travel experiences, FTLO (For the Love of Travel), a travel company that primarily designs group trips for Millennials and Zoomers, recently launched phone-free departures. ""If someone can't commit to an entire phone-free trip,"" they're encouraged ""to embrace phone-free days"", said Tara Cappel, the company's CEO and founder, who believes this practice will enable the group's participants to be fully present without feeling the pressure to post on social media and be ""reachable 24/7"".

Although it's mostly members of Gen X voicing their distaste in selfie culture, Cappel believes Millennials and Gen Z travellers are just as interested in distraction-free experiences – digital detoxes where they can put their phones down and connect with other travellers and the environment in a genuine way.

There's such a difference in the travel experience without the pressure/crutch of a smartphone

""There's such a difference in the travel experience without the pressure/crutch of a smartphone,"" said Cappel.

Tick doesn't necessarily need a phone-free trip; she appreciates having pictures to look back on after a trip. It's the posing and the striving for perfection in an attempt to make it all look candid that she can't stand. ""I like photos, and I like to travel and have photos so I can remember things,"" Tick said. But she wishes it were simpler. ""If you want a picture, take a picture.""

And if you do still feel the need to get that perfect Instagram shot, O'Keefe says that curbing irresponsible selfie behaviour is half education and half enforcement. ""Do not break the law to get a selfie,"" he said.

By Caryn James Features correspondent

HBO

Jodie Foster is on 'bracing' form in True Detective: Night Country, a creepy, suspenseful new series that is tinged with the supernatural.

In the opening credits of True Detective: Night Country, a small stuffed-toy polar bear, a graveyard full of crosses and a clothed body falling into the sea emerge under a chilly midnight-blue sky, as the soundtrack plays Billie Eilish's haunting Bury a Friend (""Bury a friend, try to wake up... I want to end""). Liz Danvers – Jodie Foster, in a bracing performance – is the brittle, acerbic police chief in the small town of Ennis, Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle. During a winter period when the sun never rises, and night lasts for weeks, she investigates after the eight scientists living at a research centre suddenly vanish, all at once. With eerie suspense, vibrant characters and a layer of the supernatural, the series' creator and director, Issa López, gives Night Country a singular feeling, and those opening credits suggest how: this show gets really creepy, in a good way. The original season of True Detective (2014), with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, set high expectations. After two much weaker follow-ups, this fourth season finally lives up to the exhilarating promise of the first.

Liz is utterly rational, with a sardonic wit that leavens the series' darkness. Foster's talent for making stern characters sympathetic and likable – or at least understandable – shapes her. The film teases out her backstory, including why she was transferred to Ennis as some kind of professional punishment, forced to move there with her belligerent adolescent stepdaughter.

In True Detective fashion, there is a second, equally important heroine who partners with Liz on the case. Evangeline Navarro (Kali Reis) – almost always called by her last name – a State Trooper of Native Inupiaq heritage, grew up partly in Ennis, and is as instinctive as Liz is rational. She has her own tragic history. Reis, a champion boxer before she became an actor, has made only two small films, but her relative inexperience never shows as she matches Foster in intensity.

The women's relationship is fraught and mysterious, teased out as effectively as their individual backstories. Basically, they hate each other. Something went very wrong between them in the past, and an old case they worked on together casts an inescapable shadow over the new one.

López meticulously plots and paces the series' trajectory. The missing scientists' whereabouts are discovered at the end of episode one, but that is just the beginning of the investigation. The more the police unravel, the more tangled the mystery becomes. How might it be related to the unsolved murder of a Native woman years before, a case that has obsessed Navarro – and that Liz is eager to leave behind? Why was that long-dead victim's severed tongue found at the empty research centre? And how might her murder be related to her protests at the local mining company, which is still polluting the local water supply? Or maybe none of that applies.

The supporting cast is as sharp as the stars. Finn Bennett is vivid and convincing as Peter Prior, a smart and good-hearted young policeman who idolises Liz, jumping when she calls so much that it jeopardises his marriage. Peter's father, Hank (John Hawkes) is also a member of the force, disgruntled that Liz is his boss. Evidently, he is not the source of Peter's good nature. ""We want him alive,"" Liz tells Hank when they go after a suspect, and Hank says, ""Do we?"" It's a line that resonates, not necessarily where you expect it to.

Night Country has the DNA of the original, with Liz and Navarro echoing the fraught-but-tight relationship between the detectives who Harrelson and McConaughey played

López, who has worked mostly in Mexican film and television, is new to the show and has said that she first proposed Night Country as a series without having the True Detective framework in mind until HBO suggested it. She did a brilliant job of retrofitting the idea. Night Country has the DNA of the original, with Liz and Navarro echoing the fraught-but-tight relationship between the detectives who Harrelson and McConaughey played, and with the first season's supernatural tinge.

But cultish ideas in season one were held by murder suspects. In Night Country the entire town and culture is imbued with spirituality and the belief that inexplicable things can have otherworldly causes, beliefs often but not only held by the Native people in Ennis. The series is filled with symbols and images. A dead man, either imagined or an actual apparition, points toward the location of corpses. A spiral symbol is tattooed on some people's heads and on a rock. In the first episode, before the men vanish, one of them says cryptically, frightened, ""She's awake.""

As the darkness drags on, the characters become more and more out of control. Episode five ends with a real shocker, and the sixth and final episode includes a claustrophobic crawl through an ice tunnel under the frozen surface of the land, all effectively sending shivers. The final episode also includes a blunt call back to True Detective season one that will tickle anyone with even a vague memory of the original.

In that last episode, it may be hard to buy what caused the men's vanishing act, an explanation that leaves you thinking, Really? Despite that, Lopez has taken inspiration from True Detective, and created a fierce, absorbing, richly imagined new show of her own.

A winter walk while it is cold is a good way to get some exercise that brings extra bonuses to your health (Credit: Getty Images)

The start of a new year is a time for making changes and resolutions to improve your health and wellbeing. We look at some of the best tips that science has to offer.

With the arrival of another new year, you might be reflecting on what you'd like to achieve and the kind of person you want to be over the next 12 months.

These failures can lead to what some psychologists describe as an annual cycle of ""false hope syndrome"". Instead, there's some evidence that it might be better to set goals that are more achievable. Research suggests that approach-orientated goals – those that are realistic, specific and where success can be easily measured – tend to be more successful than those that focus on abstaining or avoiding something, such as giving up smoking or drinking.

Deciding what to focus on, however, can be tough. So, to help you make up your mind, here are seven aspects of your life that you could focus on in the first week of the new year using some science-based tips.

By working with and against gravity, squats can help to pump blood to your brain and give it a boost (Credit: Getty Images)

Day 1: Focus on your sleep

After what might have been a late night ringing in the New Year, it perhaps makes sense to start by paying some attention to your sleep. And at this time of year, you don't need to feel guilty about hitting the snooze button – scientists say we should all be spending more time in bed during the winter.

And while you're spending more time in bed, you might also want to try lucid dreaming, a state of conscious awareness of dreaming while still asleep. Many people use lucid dreaming to help manage nightmares, solve problems, and explore creative ideas. Read more about how you can become a lucid dreamer in this feature by Jocelyn Timperley.

Watch: How to take control of your dreams

Day 2: Focus on your body

If you are a fidget, it's time to embrace it: those absent-minded movements such as a tapping foot, jigging knee or fiddling fingers can burn a surprising amount of calories and help to reduce stress.

But with the northern hemisphere in the grips of winter, it is also a good time to get out and do some exercise in the cold, which has been linked to better cardiac health, a stronger immune system and improved weight loss by turning white fat cells to brown.

While you are at it, you could even try turning around during your next walk and do it in reverse. Walking backwards has been found to burn more calories than going forwards, while also strengthening the muscles in your back. It is particularly recommended for people with knee problems as it reduces the strain on the knee joint while increasing the flexibility of the hamstrings. It can also give your brain a boost too.

And don't shy away from getting muddy on those backward walks; getting dirty can help to top up the diversity of beneficial microorgansims that live on our body. People with skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis tend to have an impoverished community of microbes on their skin.

As the largest organ in the body, skin is a surprisingly influential – and plays a curious role in shaping our health. Dry or damaged skin can release biochemicals that contribute to body-wide inflammation, eventually affecting other organs such as the heart and brain. Taking better care of this delicate organ, such as by using sunscreen and moisturiser – might not just help you to stay looking younger, but also improve your biological age. (Read more about the surprising ways our skin shapes our overall health in this article by Zaria Gorvett.)

Day 3: Focus on your mind

Talk to a stranger, enjoy a good scare, embrace the chaos of life. All of these things could help you to feel happier, more resilient and less stressed, according to science. You could also try something new. Challenging yourself by learning a new skill to ncrease brain plasticity, which helps the mind to adapt and rewire itself.

If you are feeling particularly energetic, you could also attempt some squats. By working with and against gravity, these deceptively simple exercises can give your brain a surprising boost in blood flow, which, in turn, can improve our cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills.

If that sounds like too much hard work, you could always just try thinking yourself young. Research shows that if you see yourself as young, you might just live longer. It might also be worth embracing the power of wonder too, whether that's by climbing a mountain, watching the ocean or marveling at a starry sky. Experiencing awe can reduce stress, boost memory and give you a greater sense of connection to others and the world around you.

Or why not indulge in a spot of singing – perhaps the world's most accessible stress reliever – and an aerobic exercise that releases endorphins, the brain's ""feel good"" chemicals.

Alternatively, you could just breathe. Research suggests that breathing exercises can reduce stress, anxiety, and lower blood pressure. They can also help you sleep. (Read more about the potential benefits of breathwork in this feature by Amanda Ruggeri.)

Day 4: Focus on your relationships

If you are looking for something a little more than friendship, you could do a lot worse than embracing your quirkiness. Slight changes in the clothes we wear, and having tastes and opinions that flout conventions can make us more attractive.

Adopting a different attitude towards forgiveness could also be a simple step that can bring multiple benefits to our lives. Although it can be hard, saying ""I forgive you"" – and actually meaning it – can reduce our stress levels, help us earn more money and even keep us healthier as we age.

Day 5: Focus on what you eat

December is rarely a time for calorie-counting or moderation, and rightly so. With festive tables littered with treats both savoury and sweet, many of us over-indulge – although contrary to popular belief, eating an outsized Christmas lunch doesn't really stretch your stomach. It is hardly surprising that so many of us start the new year with what we eat at the forefront of our minds.

If you still have leftovers from the festivities, eating them up rather than throwing them away is better for the climate. And while microwaving them might be frowned upon in polite circles, it can actually be the best way to retain the nutrients in food. Plus there shouldn't be any ill effects from doing so (though you might want to avoid using plastic containers for this.)

Coffee is one of those luxuries that can be good for you if drunk in moderation (Credit: Getty Images)

Eating a balanced diet is of course good at any time of year, but probably even better after all that indulgence. Research suggests that junk food – and yes, that includes the chocolates enjoyed from your post-lunch armchair – can be as bad for the mind as it can be for the body.

When it comes to fruit and vegetables, it's not just a case of eating your greens – studies have shown that a rainbow of different coloured fruit and veg can both boost brain health and cut down the chances of developing heart disease.

And while Dry January is a popular way to start the year, you don't have to do the same with coffee: research suggests that those who drink coffee have a lower risk of dying from stroke, heart disease or cancer. Although of course, it's important to consume coffee – like most things – in moderation.

Day 6 - Focus on your fitness

If you want to get fit quick, then just six sessions of interval training can increase maximal oxygen uptake, a measure of overall fitness, and the efficiency of our body's ability to burn the fuel stored in our cells.

Taking up a new hobby can help to keep your brain younger, help to fuel creativity – and stave off boredom

The time of day you exercise can also make a difference – at least where your performance is concerned. Research on Olympic swimmers and cyclists, for example, suggests that they tend to be faster in the evening. But it can also depend on your own circadian rhythms too.

For those looking to eke out an extra few repetitions in the gym or to shave some time off their personal best, it might be worth embracing the power of the placebo. Athletes who take inert pills have been shown to perform better than those who do not, an effect that mirrors what doctors see with medical placebos. But the effect also works with ""social placebos"" – training with others in a way that increases bonding and provides support can reduce the sense of fatigue and pain.

Day 7 - Focus on your hobbies

There's good news, too, if your preferred pastime is to curl up with a good book: people who read fiction are better at working out what others are thinking and feeling. And if you like to read aloud to others, it can not only improve your memory of what you are reading but also make it easier to understand complicated texts.

Watch: How boredom can be good for you

Bonus: Focus on your sex life

Our prehistoric ancestors loved it so much, they did it with Neanderthals. Even Britain's Queen Victoria was an enthusiastic participant. But despite this era-spanning passion for sex, its many mysteries are still being plumbed – and as more studies emerge, it's becoming easier to have a titillating time in the bedroom.

For one thing, adopting a ""sexual growth mindset"" by appreciating that intimate relationships must be carefully tended, rather than expected to work automatically, can help people to navigate problems in the bedroom.

Now there are also an abundance of apps which allow people to track their orgasms. These include ""biofeedback"" vibrators, for example, which use data from sensors inside to help people visualise their orgasms.

Watch: The smart way to improve your love life

For those fearing an awkward conversation with their children this year, research suggests that answering questions honestly and openly from a young age can set a positive pattern that makes it easier to talk about more complex issues later.

And banishing myths around sex more generally could be a positive step. For some women, losing their virginity is fraught with anxiety, judgement, and painful examinations, partly because of ancient ideas about the hymen. Learning how this small piece of tissue actually works, and changing the language we use to describe it, could help to improve sex for everyone.

Strikes swept the globe in industries including automotive, transport, healthcare and more (Credit: Alamy)

AI, return-to-office, the summer of strikes and more: both labourers and employers found themselves working through a rollercoaster of changes this year.

The work world has been a moving target for a while now. In 2023, some of the unresolved issues of the past three years settled, especially around the return to office. Yet evolving technology and a surge in organised labour meant plenty of new themes cropped up. They combined for a year of work unlike any other.

AI began its inevitable rise

The launch of ChatGPT on 30 November

2022 set the stage for a tidal wave of workplace changes in 2023. The impact of artificial intelligence on the labour force ­– and the future of work as we know it – was perhaps the most high profile topic of the year. And for good reason.

Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers. Recruiters began to see job applicants sending in materials written with ChatGPT; workers began to integrate the technology into their daily jobs – depending on it to the point that they found ways to secretly access the tools if they were banned.

One of the most ubiquitous worries – even existential concerns – among workers was whether AI would come for their jobs, especially as 2023 data from firms including Goldman Sachs and McKinsey and Company indicated replacement-by-robot may be imminent for many people.

The answer is still murky. Some experts say the first jobs on the generative AI chopping block may be entry-level roles, such as data entry or customer service. Yet emerging advances are also beginning to threaten higher-skilled knowledge work jobs, such as graphic designers or music producers, that workers mostly believed were ""safe"" for now.

It's not quite time to panic, though. First, many experts say there are jobs that will be difficult to automate outright – especially roles that require a human touch, sophisticated interpersonal relationships or out-of-the-box thinking.

And for positions that might be more vulnerable, experts also predict AI will end up as a supplementary technology, instead of an outright mechanism for replacement. At this point, AI is largely automating rote, repetitive tasks that can be a time-suck for workers, and could free up employees to do higher-level, more creative tasks. It also could push them to upskill, which may have long-term benefits.

At this point, experts recommend workers embrace AI, rather than fear it. The more people can understand the technology – both what it can and can't do – the more they'll be poised to work with it in ways that can advance them, and help them stay valuable to their employers.

Return-to-office became a reality

For many workers, the days of resisting return-to-office policies are over. After nearly three years of push-and-pull between employees and bosses, millions of workers are back in offices, at least partially – whether or not they want to be.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow.

While many companies have stuck with hybrid set-ups, others, such as Goldman Sachs and Disney, have leaned hard into this newfound power, recalling their employees four-to-five days per week. Others, including Amazon, have threatened workers who ignore these mandates – either denying them the opportunity to advance, or moving to terminate their employment entirely. Many companies who haven't fully returned yet have plans to do so in 2024.

If the switch seems jarring, it is. Since some offices began reopening in early 2021, workers have largely been able to make their own rules about whether they come in or not, despite years of heavy-handed pushes from leaders. Yet as job opportunities have tightened, it's far more difficult to snub these directives, since the Great Resignation is ""over"", and most workers can't easily hop into another job. And even for the new roles that are popping up, just a small percentage offer a fully remote set-up.

Yet experts are important to caveat that workers haven't entirely lost, even if they're back into their daily commute a few times a week.

The mainstreaming of hybrid set-ups means workers still have unprecedented flexibility and are unlikely to lose it entirely. Kastle Systems, which tracks employee access-card swipes for many businesses, has shown office attendance in 2023 is still a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic. Going forward, many jobs will have a hybrid schedule – a privilege formerly afforded to a select few, mostly senior employees.

Labour found its voice

""Summer of strikes"", ""hot labour summer"" – whatever the name, workers made their voices heard in 2023. Across the world, millions of people throughout many sectors organised, looking for better conditions and wages as well as career security for the future.

In the UK and US, healthcare workers conducted high-profile strikes after years of pandemic-era burnout and understaffing. Workers in transport, education and service joined them in the hundreds of thousands. But two US-based strikes particularly captured attention on the global stage.

The cooling labour market has meant the power pendulum swung back towards leaders, who put into place return-to-office mandates that many workers have no choice but to follow

On 2 May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), representing more than 10,000 screenwriters, hit the picket line over issues including pay in the era of streaming-media dominance, and future protections against evolving AI technology. The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) also went on strike on 14 July, with the two powerful unions standing in solidarity over shared concerns.

Then, on 14 September, workers at the three largest automakers in the country – GM, Ford and Stellantis – walked off the job. The members of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) were not only looking for pay increases from the executives that make millions, but also seeking to secure their jobs in an industry that is increasingly moving towards EVs.

These disputes finally settled in the autumn, with all unions securing unprecedented gains, especially around wage boosts and job-futureproofing.

Experts say moments like this may be poised to continue. Not only have the successes of these labour movements inspired and empowered workers, but data also shows Gen Z is highly supportive of organised labour. As the next generation become a larger part of the workforce, they are likely to lead more pro-union pushes.

Work perks, redefined

Throughout the past few years, perks like ping-pong tables and kombucha on tap have faded as must-haves for worker satisfaction. The pandemic transformed what workers wanted from their employers, including new wellness benefits, or flexibility to work where and when they wished. Employers have largely listened – if not magnanimously, then at least out of the desire to attract and retain talent.

This year, perks have evolved even more, as workers across the globe have settled into their post-pandemic lives. Employers have begun to modernise their benefits suites as workers settled flexible work patterns, prioritised work-life balance and found themselves with different responsibilities at home.

Some companies are hoping to make jobs more fun, offering their workers multi-thousand-dollar travel stipends to unplug, or even doling out spot bonuses in the form of points redeemable for goods and services. Others are looking at things more tactically, offering perks such as pet-friendly offices and spaces for childcare – even donations to charity for each day in the office ­– to incentivise workers back to their desks.

Perhaps this year's most notable shift, however, is the expansion of perks catering to an oft-overlooked group of workers: Gen X. An increasing number of employers are integrating benefits that help this ""sandwich generation"" – often caring for children and ageing parents at once – live life a healthier, more balanced life. Some of these new offerings include menopause support, healthcare screenings, eldercare and even ""gran-ternity leave"".

Experts say these benefits are a direct way to address worker happiness, and can pay off for employers, too; firms can become more appealing employers for older workers, who are often of leadership age. It's often a good deal for both parties.

Living on #worktok

Work culture found its way onto social media in a big way this year with #worktok. Creators across many platforms – particularly TikTok – invited users to get ready with them for their workdays, and toured them through their offices and daily grinds, often amassing millions of views. Sometimes they complained about their employers, and even quit on livestreams (accordingly, #quittok).

Perhaps most notable were the commentaries on work culture that came from this social media moment. The ""lazy girl job"", coined in May by 26-year-old Gabrielle Judge, particularly resonated with a group of workers who want to clock fewer hours and do less work (who wouldn't?). Her videos racked up hundreds of hundreds of thousands of views, and launched a tag with millions of impressions.

The workplace-talk shift to social media was inevitable, say experts. This is especially true as work and life increasingly bleed into each other, and young people in particular have not had the formative workplace interactions to build real world relationships.

""If you're working from home, you don't have that water cooler moment. Maybe if you come into a job during the pandemic, you might not have workmates who you're super close with,"" says Sara McCorquodale, the founder of UK-based influencer intelligence business CORQ. Along with creating community, she says, #WorkTok enables people to put a voice to one of the most important facets of their lives. It won't stop anytime soon.

It's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce

Workers stayed put – but checked out

The Great Resignation defined the past few years in the workplace. It was a sign of worker empowerment; since 2020, millions of employees – especially in the US – left their jobs for new ones that made them happier, were more aligned with their values or improved the overall quality of their lives.

Yet as the labour market tightened this year amid mass layoffs and an uncertain economy, mid-2023 data began to show the turnover rate for US employees had normalised to pre-pandemic levels. The shift was so significant, that in August, economists declared the Great Resignation's finale.

For workers, this marked the end of an era in job mobility. And that's bred another problem: it's not that so many workers are out of jobs, per se – rather, lots are stuck in positions they may not want to be in, for lack of an alternative while openings are scarce.

Subsequently, employees are leaning out of their work. Think the ""quiet quitting"" trend of 2022, at the next level.

In January, a survey from Gallup showed employee engagement reached its lowest level since 2015; June 2023 Gallup data showed 59% of more than 120,000 global workers say they're not engaged at work. This mentality doesn't only lead to pesky dissatisfaction – it can also contribute to lower levels of personal wellbeing, says Jim Harter, chief scientist for workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup.

This leaves workers in a bad place, of course, but companies also stand to suffer, since productivity and morale falls off a cliff with disengagement. So, as workers check out, experts say it's up to leaders to light their employees' fires again. That means investing in their careers, supporting them with the same earnestness they did during the pandemic and working on building culture.

It may be tempting for employers to sit back if they're not fearful their employees will leave – but such a decision stands to hurt everyone.

A serious look at four-day workweeks

Four-day workweek trials kicked off in 2022, and spread across the globe in 2023, both in public and private sectors. In many cases, they have been successful; after the large-scale UK four-day workweek pilot from February, 92% of participating employers said they would continue with a shorter workweek following the programme. Nearly a third made the change permanent.

Workers have reported lower burnout and stress, and relished the time off. Companies have loved seeing their workers happier and more engaged, which has led to sustained productivity and employee retention. More companies are giving the four-day workweek a go, with others codifying the set-up in the coming months. Some firms are also giving the format a try with the hope that a shorter week may lure workers back into the office.

Are 32-hour workweeks imminent for all workers? As positive as the results have been – and even as more firms jump in –­ probably not.

For instance, not every company that's tried it has declared the experiment a resounding success; some leaders found cramming five days of work into four was stressful for employees, and sometimes failed customers. Other firms simply may not be set up to ever implement the change – whether due to the nature of their businesses, or because it's not a cultural fit.","Generative AI quickly came to infiltrate nearly every element of work, both for employers and workers.

Barbara Massaad's cookbook, Forever Beirut, shares a recipe for meatballs in yoghurt sauce that is served in Lebanon on New Year's Day.

To start the year with a clean slate in Lebanon, the hearty dish of kibbeh labaniyeh (meatballs in a thick mint yoghurt sauce) is served at family tables on New Year's Day. For award-winning cookbook author, food consultant and president of Slow Food Beirut, Barbara Massaad, kibbeh labaniyeh is ""comfort food with a capital C"".

""My kids always make fun of me because I say it 10 times when we're eating it,"" Massaad said from her home in Beirut, as she cracked eggs into a pan of heated yoghurt. ""Kibbeh labaniyeh is white, pure… it's so good. Everything that has to do with dairy is nurturing and delicious.""

Her recipe for kibbeh labaniyeh appears in her 2022 cookbook Forever Beirut, which compiles all the important tabkheh (everyday recipes from family homes) in Lebanon.

""We take the tabkheh very seriously,"" Massaad explained. ""One of the priorities for women in Lebanon is to have the food ready for the kids when they come home from school, even if she works, she will do it early morning or the night before.""

Forever Beirut is dedicated to the victims of the Beirut port explosion of August 2020, when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate improperly stored in the capital's port ignited and blew up the inner city, killing more than 200 people. For Massaad, cooking is an art and a form of expression, so after the explosion she knew she needed to write a cookbook to get through that difficult period. Kibbeh labaniyeh was an obvious choice to add into the collection of recipes.

""It nourishes the soul, you really feel good when you're eating it,"" Massaad said, as she delicately transferred the kibbeh balls into the yoghurt sauce.

Massaad, who spends much of her time in rural Lebanon with local food producers, believes kibbeh labaniyeh may have originated in east Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley where cow's milk is abundant. But there are many different kibbeh dishes throughout the diverse regions of Lebanon, including vegetarian versions and ones that consist of raw meat. Kibbeh balls alone are an integral part of the Lebanese mezze table, almost always on offer at gatherings.

The meatballs for kibbeh labaniyeh are formed from a shell of bulgur that is spiced with allspice, cinnamon, cumin and black pepper and then stuffed with minced meat and pine nuts.

Shaping the balls takes practice – it's an art – and once you form the perfect football-shaped kibbeh that doesn't crack, the satisfaction is immense. Making sure your hands are wet when moulding the balls helps a great deal.

In some Lebanese homes, they order kibbeh labaniyah and place large amounts in the freezer to take out when needed. This means they can make kibbeh labaniyeh in only half an hour; the meatballs can be baked from frozen until the outer layer is slightly crisp.

Using dried mint for the sauce (rather than fresh) adds an extra punch, and Massaad suggests allowing the yoghurt to come to room temperature before cooking it. ""You don't want to shock the yoghurt – [adding it] from the fridge to the cooking pan immediately is a no no,"" she said.

When cooking the yoghurt sauce, it is important to add egg if using cow's milk yoghurt, otherwise the dairy will curdle and become lumpy. As you cook it, Massaad explained, ""You need to thicken it like a sauce – you don't want it to be watery.""

The thick sauce collects on the rice as it is served, and the bulgur shell soaks up the fluffy yoghurt, melding with the stuffing. The dish is surely heavy, but in a wholesome, fulfilling way, preparing you for the year ahead.

Kibbeh Labaniyeh recipe (Kibbeh in Yoghurt Sauce) By Barbara Massaad

Serves 4

Ingredients 12 kibbeh balls (stuffed or left hollow), raw or cooked and frozen (or use homemade Kibbeh Iras (Kibbeh Balls)) 1kg (4 cups) plain, full-fat cow or goat yoghurt, at room temperature for one hour 1 large egg, whisked (only if using cow's milk yoghurt) salt 1½ tbsp cornflour diluted with 120ml (¼ cup) water 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2-3 garlic cloves, minced 1 bunch mint or coriander, leaves finely chopped, or 1 tbsp dried mint, crumbled

Method

Step 1 Prepare your kibbeh balls. If the balls are raw or frozen, you can deep-fry them, bake them at 200C/400F for 5 minutes, or drop them in a pot of boiling water for 2 minutes (remove with a slotted spoon and pierce them in a few places with a toothpick – this will help them hold their shape).

Step 2 Put the yoghurt in a large saucepan and set over medium heat. Add the egg (if using), season with salt and slowly bring to a boil, whisking constantly in the same direction to prevent the yoghurt from curdling (the egg helps with this). As soon as the yoghurt starts to bubble, lower the heat to a gentle simmer and whisk in the diluted cornflour. Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened.

Step 3 Drop the kibbeh balls gently into the hot yoghurt and simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring carefully so they don't break.

Step 4 Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and sauté the garlic just until golden. Mix in the mint or coriander, lower the heat, and cook just until the leaves have wilted but are still green. Gently stir into the yogurt sauce. Serve hot with plain rice or vermicelli rice.

Homemade Kibbeh Iras (Kibbeh Balls) By Barbara Massaad

Makes about 24

Ingredients For the kibbeh shells: 1 small onion, quartered 225g (8oz) lean lamb leg mince or beef sirloin mince ½ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (optional) ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper ½ tsp salt ice cubes 400g (2½ cups) fine brown bulgur For the stuffing: 1 tbsp clarified butter or butter 35g (¼ cup) pine nuts 1 small onion, finely chopped 250g (9oz) coarsely minced lamb or beef with 20% fat ¼ tsp salt ¼ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground cumin (optional) ½ tbsp pomegranate molasses (optional) vegetable oil, for deep-frying

Method

Step 1 To make the kibbeh shell mixture, very finely chop the onion in a food processor. Add the meat, along with the spices and salt and a couple of ice cubes. Blend until you have a smooth, creamy paste.

Step 2 Wash and drain the bulgur well, then add it to the meat mixture. Pulse for 1 minute to combine. Transfer to a mixing bowl.

Step 3 Prepare a small bowl of ice water. Dipping your hands into the ice water periodically to prevent sticking, knead the mixture for a few minutes until smooth and uniform. Set the bowl of water aside for later.

Step 4 To make the stuffing, melt ½ tbsp of the clarified butter in a frying pan. Sauté the pine nuts until golden brown, watching carefully so they don't burn. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on paper towels to drain.

Step 5 Add the rest of the clarified butter to the pan and sauté the onion until translucent. Stir in the meat, salt, spices and pomegranate molasses, if using, and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Once cooked, stir in the fried pine nuts and set aside.

Step 6 Moistening your hands with the cold water, divide the shell mixture into 24 even balls each about the size of a walnut. Place one ball in your hand. Poke a hole in the ball using the index finger of your other hand and rotate your finger to make a hollow. The walls of the shell should be an even 1cm (½in) thick and the length of about 8cm (3in). Be careful not pierce the bottom or sides of the shell.

Step 7 Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the stuffing into the hollow and pinch the opening together with moistened fingers to seal the opening, forming the kibbeh into a football shape (like a rugby ball). Repeat with the remaining shell mixture and stuffing. At this stage, you can freeze the kibbeh balls. Space them out on a tray to freeze, then transfer to re-sealable containers or bags.

Step 8 If you're using them immediately, pour vegetable oil into a large pot or deep fryer to a depth of 5cm (2in). Heat until the oil reaches a temperature of 180C (350F), or until small bubbles gather around a small piece of bread dropped into the oil. Working in batches, deep fry the kibbeh for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a colander to drain the excess oil. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Tip You can easily double this recipe to make a bigger batch and keep the kibbeh frozen.

Daizen Maeda scored after just 54 seconds

Celtic scored twice in the opening six minutes on the way to beating St Mirren and maintaining their eight-point lead at the summit of the Scottish Premiership.

Daizen Maeda scored his side's first goal of the year for the third successive January when he dashed away from Scott Tanser to fire beyond Zach Hemming after just 54 seconds.

After neatly setting up the first, Matt O'Riley smartly tucked away the second. His wonderful first touch created the angle for Hemming to be nutmegged to round off a magnificent move.

The half could not have started any worse for Stephen Robinson's side and it ended in similar disappointment as Toyosi Olusanya was shown a red card after a VAR review after his boot caught Joe Hart's face.

That decision made a tough test even tougher for the Paisley side and Greg Taylor's second-half thunderous volley inflicted further misery.

Following Rangers' early win against Kilmarnock, Celtic reclaimed their advantage, albeit having played two games more, while St Mirren remain in fifth, two points behind Derek McInnes' side.

Backing up Saturday's derby day victory was imperative for the league leaders, but against a St Mirren side who took an early lead the last time the sides met at Celtic Park, there were no guarantees the three points would come easy.

However, a speedy start settled any nerves among the away support. The quickest goal of the season for the champions was scored by Maeda, but it was all about the perfectly-weighted pass from O'Riley, making his 100th Celtic appearance.

The Denmark international had Paulo Bernardo to thank for the milestone being marked by a goal. The crafty Portuguese midfielder turned tremendously and teed up his team-mate in a classy move.

St Mirren failed to threaten, but pre-match Robinson had highlighted Olusanya's pace as an asset in a game where opportunities would be few and far between.

On the rare occasion the ball made its way to Celtic goalmouth, the striker mistimed his attempt and instead caught Hart in the face. His initial yellow card was upgraded after David Munro was asked to take another look at the incident.

With a player advantage, Celtic's speed and tempo was even more pronounced. Bernardo again provided a sensational assist, this time a dinked effort into the path for the left-back to slam home.

This came just minutes after the Portuguese had his own top-corner bound effort well saved by Hemming.

If it wasn't for the St Mirren goalkeeper, the scoreline could have been much heavier. Substitutes Oh Hyeon-gyu, Yang Hyun-jun and Liel Abada were all denied, while Kyogo also headed wide when a goal appeared likely.

Player of the match - Paulo Bernardo (Celtic)

A toss-up between Bernardo and O'Riley, but the Portuguese just edges it due to his quality assists. Quite the way to back up his derby-day heroics.

Celtic ruthlessly respond in comfortable and commanding win - analysis

What a difference a week can make.

Last Tuesday, Celtic swept aside Dundee in a ""much more like it"" showing after a profligate performance against Livingston and the back-to-back defeats by Kilmarnock and Hearts.

That was followed up by a statement win against their fiercest rivals at the weekend and rounded off by this comfortable victory.

With 24 shots - 11 of which were on target - Celtic were back to their free-flowing best. The shackles were off.

With 103 final third entries and 53 touches in the opposition box, the confidence that had perhaps appeared dented of late was back. It could have been so much more if it were not for Hemming.

O'Riley and Callum McGregor have been shining lights throughout but the emergence of Bernardo as an impressive cog in midfield will bring satisfaction to Rodgers.

For St Mirren, it's one to shove to the back of the mind as quickly as Maeda opened the scoring in Paisley.

There were mismatches all over the park long before it was a 10-man task. Overrun in midfield, bamboozled out wide and front men starved of service. A tough pill to swallow after an uplifting win at Pittodrie.

What they said

St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""I haven't seen [the red card] back, but that wasn't the reason why we lost the game so it's irrelevant.

""We started the game really poorly against a very good Celtic side, which you can't do. The red card compounds the pain we're suffering. It was a long afternoon.""

'Maeda will be miss but other players coming back'

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We made a really good start, this can be a really tricky place to come and play, but we started on the front foot, playing forward and scored two goals in the opening 10 minutes.

""I'm really pleased, the sending off meant it was more difficult for them but we managed that side of it in the second half much better than we did at the weekend.""

What's next?

Both sides are in Scottish Cup action after the winter break. St Mirren host Queen of the South on 20 January (15:00 GMT) while Celtic welcome Buckie Thistle the next day (16:00)

In December, Erik ten Hag said it was up to Jadon Sancho to facilitate his return to Manchester United's first-team squad

Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho might return to Borussia Dortmund on loan this month.

Sancho refused to apologise to Erik ten Hag for a social media post after the manager said his omission from September's defeat at Arsenal was related to his performance in training.

The England winger, 23, rejected this and said he was being made a scapegoat.

Since then he has been training away from the first team, with no end in sight to his exile.

United bought Sancho from Dortmund for £73m in July 2021.

It is understood the Bundesliga club are willing to offer Sancho a route back in the January transfer window, and are optimistic of reaching an agreement for the remainder of the season.

Any deal might require United to pay a significant portion of Sancho's wages, given the huge increase he received when he signed for the Red Devils.","Last updated on .From the section Man UtdIn December, Erik ten Hag said it was up to Jadon Sancho to facilitate his return to Manchester United's first-team squadManchester United outcast Jadon Sancho might return to Borussia Dortmund on loan this month.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67821045,Rangers 3-1 Kilmarnock: Manager Philippe Clement hopes to do 'more business',['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Scottish Premiership

New signing Fabio Silva (left) had a 19-minute cameo in Rangers' win over Kilmarnock

Rangers manager Philippe Clement vowed to do ""more business"" after heading into the Scottish Premiership break with victory over Kilmarnock.

Ross McCausland fired the hosts in front after Kyle Vassell was denied when clean through on the Rangers goal, and Abdallah Sima's stunning chest touch and volley added a quick second before the break.

Danny Armstrong converted a VAR-awarded penalty following John Souttar's handball - the first Rangers have conceded in 75 league games - but Todd Cantwell restored the two-goal advantage.

Rangers, beaten by Celtic on Saturday, are eight points behind the league leaders with two games in hand and gave new forward signing Fabio Silva a run out as a substitute. Kilmarnock, fourth, trail Hearts by five points.

""We're going to do some more business,"" said Clement. ""Everybody in the club is aligned around that and we have now one month to do the good business.""

Kilmarnock counterpart Derek McInnes, meanwhile, hopes to sign a striker.

""You can do good work in January,"" he said. ""There's two or three things been identified.

""I actually don't think I've ever been in a transfer window where I've not been looking for a striker. We'll try and bring a striker in or a forward player in that can maybe compliment what we've got.

""It's free agents and the loan market that we'll look to try and exploit. I just don't want anybody to leave.""

The Vassell chance prompted Kilmarnock's best spell of the game, though that was their best opening.

And it was against the run of play that Rangers took the lead. Cyriel Dessers, having gone close with a shot and a header, swept a superb pass from halfway in behind David Watson for McCausland to chase and finish.

Then came Sima's moment. The winger received Connor Goldson's pass on the 18-yard line, controlled, spun away from Joe Wright and lashed a shot past the helpless Will Dennis.

The half-time scoreline was harsh on Kilmarnock and they needed a response early in the second period.

They probed and when Rory McKenzie's delivery struck Souttar's arm, referee John Beaton reviewed at the monitor and pointed to the spot - the first Premiership penalty Rangers have conceded since January 2022. Armstrong scored confidently.

But the reprieve was short lived. Ridvan Yilmaz's cross from the left perfectly met the near-post run of Cantwell and the midfielder applied the finish.

Rangers' first signing of the January transfer window, Fabio Silva, came on for his debut in place of Dessers and James Tavernier, twice, and Cantwell tested Dennis in the final half hour.

Player of the match - Abdallah Sima (Rangers)

Rangers' second scorer was a persistent threat on the left and lit up the game with his goal

Sima shows Rangers what they'll be missing - analysis

With his 15th goal of the season, Sima demonstrated what Rangers will be missing when he goes to the African Cup of Nations with Senegal.

That tournament runs from 13 January to 11 February, meaning Sima could be unavailable until Rangers' match with St Johnstone on 17 February.

The performance and result allowed Rangers to get their weekend disappointment out of their system and go into the winter break with a morale-boosting three points.

After winning the first meeting of the sides on the opening day of the season, Kilmarnock once again showed their ability to restrict Rangers for long spells.

If the passing from the hosts was not precise, there was usually a Killie boot or head in the way.

Going forward, the visitors were adept at getting into the right areas - particularly with the Vassell chance - but what will frustrate manager Derek McInnes is losing the third goal so soon after getting back into the contest at 2-1.

A late Liam Polworth shot would have made for an interesting finale had it not gone just wide.

What they said

'We need clarity on what's handball and what's not'

Rangers manager Philippe Clement: ""It was an exceptional goal [by Sima]. The finish was really world class. I give [McCausland] a lot of minutes because he deserves it, he performs, he works for the team. He's growing and growing.

""I don't think that John Souttar can do much more or much less with his arm than he did. I hope there comes clarity for the second part of the season. It's important that there's clarity about what is handball and what is not handball.""

Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: ""It felt so harsh for us [going behind]. The second goal came from nowhere. From a defensive point of view, it's difficult to be too critical of that.

""We just wanted to win the second half. We get ourselves a goal back. What we needed to do then was just be a wee bit more street-wise. The third goal is the goal where we've really not defended it well. We kept going and credit to them.""

What's next?

Both sides are next in action in the Scottish Cup on 20 January. Kilmarnock host Dundee (15:00 GMT) and Rangers visit Dumbarton (17:30).

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/67866212,Nandre Burger: The smiling South African quick defying calls for more menace,['Author not found'],"Nandre Burger took seven wickets on his debut Test and such was his performance, Virat Kohli spent a large part of India's nets this week practising against left-arm quick bowling

Nandre Burger ticks about every box possible for a menacingly fast strike bowler.

He charges towards the wicket with powerful strides. His 6ft 2in frame coils at the crease before his muscular arms act as trebuchets to unleash thunderbolts at the batter's nose and toes.

A left-armer, he can bring the ball back into the right-hander - as he did to bowl a set KL Rahul in South Africa's innings win over India last week - and he can shape it away.

There's just one part of his game that doesn't fit the stereotype.

""I can't help that I'm mostly always smiling on the field,"" he tells the BBC before the second and final Test against India. ""It's who I am. I'm not trying to be like anyone else.""

It's true. Burger's smile is ubiquitous. Watching him, one might assume he was representing a village side famed for its generous lunches rather than a nation that has produced the likes of Allan Donald, Andre Nel and Dale Steyn.

Another South African, albeit one who represented and captained England, took issue with Burger's beaming grins.

Writing on X, Kevin Pietersen noted: ""I like Nandre Burger. I like his pace a lot. The only thing I'd like even more, is if he didn't smile as much and got more aggressive! Smiling at batters gives them a small win every single time. Bowl fast, seriously fast and DO NOT smile after most deliveries!""

Burger does not have an active presence on social media but plenty of friends shared Pietersen's post with him.

""It doesn't bother me at all,"" he says with a laugh. ""Just because I'm smiling and enjoying what I'm doing doesn't mean I'm not aggressive with the ball. It doesn't mean I'm happy to lose or get hit for runs.

""I've had days where I lost my cool. It will be a day where I feel that I have to pick a fight to be at my best. That might be throwing the ball towards the batter to rev myself up. But there are more days where I'm in the battle regardless so I might as well enjoy it.""

Perhaps this mindset is a consequence of Burger's unorthodox entry into elite cricket. Growing up in Krugersdorp to the north-west of Johannesburg, he played a variety of sports, including cricket and rugby, but tennis and squash were his primary loves.

It was only a casual net while studying a sports psychology degree at the University of the Witwatersrand that set him on a new course. Watching from the side was the former first-class cricketer Neil Levenson, who spotted something worth getting excited about.

""I was raw,"" Burger remembers. ""But Neil told me I could become a professional cricketer. I didn't really believe it but it was amazing to hear. After speaking with him I decided to give it a big push and that's when it started.""

But Burger was a difficult student. He'd push back and argue. He didn't understand why Levenson had him running to the wicket without a ball, or delivering one while blindfolded. Adjustments to his feet, his wrists and his hands felt like unnecessarily work. All he wanted to do was bowl fast.

Still, steady improvements meant he was a project worth investing in. And given his unique attributes, his potential was exponentially higher than his peers.

South Africa might be a breeding ground for fast bowlers but it is a comparative desert when it comes to left-arm seamers. Between the Proteas being welcomed back into international cricket in 1991 following the end of apartheid, and Marco Jansen - another left-arm seamer in the team - making his debut on Boxing Day 30 years later, South African southpaws took just 68 Test wickets.

South Africa's most prolific left-arm seamer over this period was the blistering Brett Schultz, but injuries restricted his career to just nine Tests worth 37 wickets. Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Beuran Hendricks and Charl Willoughby played a mere 14 games between them.

Now the Proteas have two of these rare weapons in their ranks. Along with the generational talent that is Kagiso Rabada, as well as arguably South Africa's best-ever spinner in Keshav Maharaj, not to mention the express pace of the injured Anrich Nortje, the Proteas have an arsenal as potent as any in the game.

Which makes the lack of upcoming Test cricket in the country all the more heartbreaking for fans of the swinging, seaming and spitting red ball.

Cricket South Africa are sending a diluted team to New Zealand for a two-Test series as their household names remain at home for the SA20 franchise league in January. Not that Burger has given much thought about any of that.

""I am the worst person to ask about any sort of schedule,"" he admits. ""I know the week before that we're playing a game. I'm not too much of a thinker about what next week, or next month or next year comes. Especially with cricket. I try not to think about it too much when I'm not playing.

""But it has been difficult for South Africa. And it doesn't seem like it's getting better. But by showing we can compete with the big teams like India, if we can beat them then they'll want to play against us. That's how you make sure everyone wants to play you. By being the best and competing.

""That is what it's about. We're taking it day by day. You never know when you'll get the chance again.""

And maybe that's why he plays his cricket with a smile on his face.","Another South African, albeit one who represented and captained England, took issue with Burger's beaming grins.
Burger does not have an active presence on social media but plenty of friends shared Pietersen's post with him.
""Just because I'm smiling and enjoying what I'm doing doesn't mean I'm not aggressive with the ball.

Rafael Nadal's previous singles match was a second-round loss at the Australian Open on 18 January 2023

Rafael Nadal impressed on his long-awaited return after almost a year out with injury as he beat Dominic Thiem at the Brisbane International.

Nadal, contesting his first singles match in 349 days, won 7-5 6-1.

Spain's 22-time Grand Slam champion has indicated this season will likely be the last of his illustrious career.

""Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career,"" 37-year-old Nadal said.

""I had the chance to come back after a year and play in front of an amazing crowd and play at a very positive level on the first day, [It] is something that makes us feel proud - my team and family who have been there every day in the last year.""

Wildcard Nadal is using the tournament to prepare for the Australian Open, which starts on 14 January in Melbourne.

He will play Australian Jason Kubler, ranked 102, in the last 16 on Thursday.

Nadal begins comeback in possible final year

The last time Nadal was seen in singles action he struggled with injury as he lost to Mackenzie McDonald in the second round of the 2023 Australian Open.

He had an operation on his left hip in June and has has since slipped to 672nd in the world rankings.

Nadal began his comeback by partnering compatriot Marc Lopez in a doubles loss to Australians Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson in Brisbane on Sunday, two days before his first singles test.

At times on Tuesday, it appeared as though Nadal had never been away.

He set the tone by winning 21 of his opening 24 points on serve, displaying skill, poise and athleticism to the delight of the expectant evening crowd.

Thiem, the 2020 US Open champion who has had his own injury problems, had come through his first five service games without any scares. But Nadal, with famed intensity and reassuringly sharp movement, seized his opportunity in the 12th game - taking his fourth break point to wrap up the first set.

He maintained that momentum at the start of the second set, securing love holds either side of breaking the Austrian's serve for a second time as he opened a 3-0 lead.

A fading Thiem managed to end the run of games against him but he was unable to prevent Nadal securing another break for a commanding 5-1 advantage.

When he secured the victory, Nadal raised his arms and thanked the crowd as they celebrated a moment of great significance with him.

He said in May, after being forced to miss the French Open for the first time in 19 years, that 2024 will ""probably"" be the final year of his career.

But, following his doubles return in Brisbane, he said his desire to play on remains strong and he did not want to say ""100%"" that this season would be his last.

Victory over Thiem was Nadal's 1,069th at tour level, a total which moved him past Ivan Lendl to sit fourth on the all-time men's list.

""As you can imagine, today it wasn't a statistic I was aware of,"" Nadal said.

""I had enough work just to be focused and come back on court and remember how to play in a competitive match.

""There were nerves and doubts before the match. But things went well and I'm excited to be back.""

Prior to his injury, Nadal was level with Serbia's Novak Djokovic for the record number of men's major triumphs, but Djokovic went on to win last year's French Open and US Open to move to 24 Grand Slam titles.","Last updated on .From the section TennisRafael Nadal's previous singles match was a second-round loss at the Australian Open on 18 January 2023Rafael Nadal impressed on his long-awaited return after almost a year out with injury as he beat Dominic Thiem at the Brisbane International.
