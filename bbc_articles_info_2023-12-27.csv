Israel's military chief said the war with Hamas would last ""many more months""

Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months.

The UN has expressed grave concern after Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens of people in Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi camps in recent days.

Heavy fighting is also continuing to the south, in the city of Khan Younis.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian president has described what is happening in Gaza as ""beyond a war of annihilation"".

The Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 195 people have been killed across the territory over the past 24 hours.

More than 21,100 have been killed - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the ministry.

The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

Palestinian media cited local officials and witnesses as saying dozens of civilians were killed as Israel kept up its strikes across Gaza overnight.

Heavy bombardment was reported in the Middle Area, particularly in Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat camps.

In Nuseirat, Israeli warplanes targeted the homes of the Nasser and Hazouqi families, killing a number of people and wounding dozens more, according to the official Wafa news agency.

Hamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported that five had been killed in a strike on a girls school in Maghazi.

Residents meanwhile told Reuters news agency that there was heavy fighting east and north of Bureij district and in the nearby village of Juhr al-Deek.

Israel has ordered the evacuation of areas of central Gaza where the UN says more than 150,000 people are living

There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday evening that its forces had ""expanded the combat to the area known as the Central Camps"".

The IDF also reiterated on Tuesday its order for residents to leave more than a dozen central areas running from the Gaza-Israel perimeter to the coast, including Bureij and Nuseirat camps.

According to the UN, the affected areas were home to nearly 90,000 people before the war. They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north.

The residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people.

The UN human rights office said on Tuesday that it was gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday.

It also warned of a ""deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation"", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced.

A Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were ""having to live with... constant loss, constant fear"".

""Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes,"" she said. ""My four-year-old nephew... had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago.""

The bombardment of the north and south of Gaza also continued on Wednesday.

In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a house where displaced people were staying near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis.

The Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital, said dozens were killed or wounded and posted a graphic video that showed paramedics and bystanders retrieving several bodies on a street.

The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but a spokesperson did appear to confirm reports from Tuesday that Israel had handed over the bodies of 80 Palestinians after checking there were no hostages among them.

""During the war, bodies have been transported to Israel for an identification procedure as part of our effort to locate the hostages and the missing persons,"" the spokesperson said.

It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. A number of bodies have also been recovered and Israeli officials have confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas.

Watch: Drone shots show Palestinians buried in mass grave

Israel's been under pressure from its closest ally, the US, to lower the intensity of its military operations in Gaza and reduce the number of civilian deaths, but there is no sign of that happening yet.

The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in ""a complex area"" and would therefore ""continue for many more months"".

""There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined,"" he added.

""We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months.""

He was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq.

In his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history.

""What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this,"" he told Egypt's ON TV.

Mr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time.

On Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry.","Israel expanding ground offensive into central Gaza refugee campsBy David Gritten BBC NewsReutersIsrael's military chief said the war with Hamas would last ""many more months""Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months.

South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun

South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun, best known for his role in the Oscar-winning film Parasite, has been found dead in an apparent suicide in central Seoul.

Police found the body of the actor, who was 48, in a car near a city park on Wednesday. They believe Lee took his own life, Yonhap news agency reports.

Police said earlier they had received a report that he had left his home after writing a note.

He had been under investigation for alleged illegal drug use since October.

Lee's body was taken to Seoul National University Hospital after police located his car near Waryong Park. Reports say his family have refused an autopsy and he will be buried on Friday.

Police have begun an investigation to establish the details around his death, including when he arrived at the scene where his body was found, and the time of his death.

In Parasite, Lee played the patriarch of the wealthy Park family which is infiltrated by members of a poor family posing as unrelated individuals. The vicious social satire won four Oscars, including best picture.

Yonhap reported that he was suspected of taking drugs such as marijuana and ketamine with a hostess at a bar in Seoul. He had said that though he took what she gave him, he had not known that they were illicit drugs.

The hostess had reportedly told the police that he used drugs at her home multiple times - something he denied. He had earlier requested through his lawyer to take a lie detector test.

His drug tests had returned negative or inconclusive results, the report added.

Police said they regretted that Lee had died in the midst of investigations, but that the inquiry had been ""conducted with [his] consent"", News1 Korea reported. Lee underwent three rounds of questioning, with one session last Saturday lasting 19 hours, according to Yonhap.

Lee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, said in a statement: ""There is no way to contain the sorrow and despair. We respectfully ask that you refrain from spreading false facts based on speculation... so that [Lee's] final journey will not be unfair.""

News of his death sparked strong reactions online.

""I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for him. Rest in peace,"" read a comment on one of the news reports.

""Aren't celebrities human? People can make mistakes in their lives. It's so sad,"" said another.

There was also praise for his work.

One fan, writing on X (formerly Twitter), wrote: ""I laughed and cried a lot while watching your acting. Thank you.""

The actor, who was married to actress Jeon Hye-jin and had two young sons with her, had a career spanning more than two decades.

He starred as the lead in dozens of films and TV shows, becoming a household name through the 2010s.

He rose to international fame with Parasite, as it became the first non-English language film to win the Best Picture Oscar.

In South Korea, celebrities are held to high standards of propriety.

Lee had a squeaky-clean, family-man image prior to his alleged drug use, but reports that emerged from the investigation caused considerable damage to his reputation.

Speaking to reporters in late October before going into a police station for questioning, he said: ""I sincerely apologise for causing great disappointment to many people by being involved in such an unpleasant incident.

""I feel sorry for my family, which is enduring such difficult pain at this moment.""

Lee was dropped from No Way Out, a mystery TV series that began shooting in October. According to reports, some businesses were seen taking down posters and advertisements featuring Lee from their stores.

Drug offences, including those involving usage of marijuana, are considered serious crimes in South Korea. Consumption of marijuana carries prison sentences of up to five years.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed a crackdown on drugs. This year, the country's authorities expanded its drug crimes department and the national police chief promised ""a total war"" on drug crimes.

Lee is not the only South Korean celebrity who had been investigated for drug use recently. Earlier this month, K-pop star G-Dragon was cleared of drug allegations after weeks of investigations.

Actor Yoo Ah-in is currently standing trial for drug use.

By Robert Greenall BBC News

Mr Trump's place on the ballot in Michigan was never thought to be in danger

Michigan's supreme court has refused to hear an appeal by voters in the US state to disqualify Donald Trump from next year's presidential primary.

They sought to invoke a clause in the US Constitution, barring anyone who has engaged in insurrection, over Mr Trump's role in the 2021 Capitol riots.

The decision comes days after Colorado became the first state to rule that Mr Trump was not an eligible candidate.

Michigan is considered a battleground state in the 2024 general election.

Traditionally voting Democrat, it supported Mr Trump, a Republican, in his successful 2016 presidential campaign, but then reverted to current President Joe Biden in 2020.

Pro-democracy advocacy group Free Speech for People filed the lawsuit in September.

But unlike in Colorado, the bid failed early on in the process, and the appeal to the supreme court was seen as having little chance of success.

Courts in Michigan rejected the case on procedural grounds and did not examine the question of whether 6 January 2021 was an insurrection and whether Mr Trump played a part in it.

Supreme Court justice Elizabeth Welch explained that Michigan's laws were different from Colorado's.

The appellants ""have identified no analogous provision in the Michigan Election Law that requires someone seeking the office of President of the United States to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office"", she wrote.

Colorado's 4-3 supreme court decision last week, which refers only to the state primary on 5 March, does not stop Mr Trump from running in other states.

It is the first-ever use of Section 3 of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment to disqualify a presidential candidate. The measure was ratified after the American Civil War to block secessionists from returning to previous government roles once southern states rejoined the Union.","Trump election: Michigan supreme court rejects ballot disqualification bidBy Robert Greenall BBC NewsReutersMr Trump's place on the ballot in Michigan was never thought to be in dangerMichigan's supreme court has refused to hear an appeal by voters in the US state to disqualify Donald Trump from next year's presidential primary.

By Kayla Epstein BBC News

President Joe Biden's policies toward Israel's conflict in the Gaza Strip are unpopular among young voters.

The 2024 presidential election promises to be one of the most polarising political contests in living memory. But as the war in Gaza rages, President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel is putting him at odds with some of his key supporters - younger voters.

Abdul Osmanu, 22, is not sure he can cast a ballot for President Joe Biden again. Much of that hesitation, he said, involves the Biden administration's support of Israel as it continues to bombard Gaza.

""As a lover of peace, a Muslim, and a black man, it's terrible to see the repression of the Palestinians,"" said Mr Osmanu, who was elected to his local town council in 2021. ""It'd be tough for me, in my conscience, to vote for a president aiding and abetting that in many ways.""

The young Connecticut voter told the BBC that he was weighing whether to vote for a third-party candidate or leave his presidential ballot blank in 2024. The decision is difficult, however, as he - and many other young voters - do not want to see Donald Trump elected again.

An increasing number of young Democratic voters, like Mr Osmanu, appear to be breaking with President Biden over the issue of Israel and the conflict in Gaza. It is a cause for concern for Democrats, as their opposition to Mr Biden's policies could threaten a key pillar of support that the elder statesman leaned on during the 2020 election.

Rhonda Caldwell

Abdul Osmanu said he was unsure whether he could vote for Joe Biden again.

For the past two months, young voters have seen in the news and on social media images of war and destruction from within Gaza. They have followed the death toll as it climbed to over 20,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

At the same time, they have watched as Mr Biden publicly backed Israel's stated effort to eradicate Hamas after they and allied groups killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October. It continues to hold an estimated 100 hostages in Gaza.

The BBC reviewed polling research and spoke to six young Democratic voters and organisers from across the US. Data and interviews appear to show a growing sense of political discord among young voters ahead of the 2024 election.

The Biden campaign declined to comment.

But registered voters aged 18-29 said they were more likely to support the Palestinian cause over Israel, a recent New York Times/Siena poll suggested. According to the survey, voters aged 18-29 had critical views of Israel and its counteroffensive against Hamas across the board, while older generations had more favourable views of the country.

Though a clear majority of registered voters - 57% - disapprove of the way Mr Biden is handling the conflict, young voters have the greatest objections. A total 72% of voters aged 18-29 disapprove of Mr Biden's efforts, the Times/Siena poll indicated.

Anna Bosking, a 22-year-old Iowa native, plans to vote for Mr Biden again. But after taking a Middle Eastern politics course at university, speaking to classmates from Gaza and seeing eyewitness accounts on social media, she has become more critical of America's relationship with Israel.

""Before this conflict I always thought Israel was a consistent ally that we would always support, and I never had any issues,"" she told the BBC. ""But I think the American people have been forced to consider the historical context in the situation.""

One possible reason for the divide is that young Democrats, particularly progressives, are also more likely to connect the cause of Palestinian statehood to the fights for social justice playing out in the US.

""A lot of the organisations that I'm present in have made strong connections to what the Palestinians experience, and want to continue to uplift their struggle,"" said Michael Abramson, the 25-year-old policy director of Young Democrats of Maricopa County in Arizona.

Mr Abramson organises in a key Arizona county for Democrats. He said he was confident the youth would turn out in Arizona for other candidates and ballot measures - such as abortion - but he said he was unsure whether he and others would vote for the Democratic nominee, whom he called ""the lesser of two evils"".

Democrats relied on young voter turnout to propel them to victory in the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms. The Democratic apparatus typically pours millions of dollars into youth outreach and engagement to shore up support.

Multiple young voters told the BBC that they were torn over the 2024 election, despite seeing Joe Biden as the ""lesser of two evils"" when compared to Donald Trump.

And not all young voters criticised Mr Biden's position towards Israel.

Jessica Schwab, a 20-year-old student at Columbia University in New York, said she did not want to see Mr Trump re-elected and thought Mr Biden was handling the conflict well.

""He's standing with Israel and providing them with military supplies, and general funding in their defence,"" she said. ""But I do like how he is also asking for humanitarian pauses, and inserting some sort of breathing room to reduce the amount of casualties that are occurring in Gaza.""

Mr Biden's backers also argue that the 2024 election is nearly a year away, and that young Democrats would come back to the fold if presented with a choice between Mr Biden and Mr Trump.","Israel Gaza: Angst grows among young voters over Biden's policyBy Kayla Epstein BBC NewsGetty ImagesPresident Joe Biden's policies toward Israel's conflict in the Gaza Strip are unpopular among young voters.

Apple says it will appeal US import ban on its latest smart watch models.

Apple says it will appeal after sales of its newest smart watches were halted in the US over a patent row.

It comes after the White House declined to overturn a ban on sales and imports of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches which came into effect this week.

The US International Trade Commission took the action to protect device maker Masimo, which accuses Apple of poaching its staff and technology.

Apple said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the ruling.

Earlier this month, Apple ""pre-emptively"" removed the devices from its US site and from stores in the country. Sales elsewhere have not been affected.

The US International Trade Commission (USITC) order, issued in October, was subject to a 60-day review by the president, who has the power to veto the decision. That review period ended on Christmas Day.

The office of the United States Trade Representative Ambassador, Katherine Tai, said on Tuesday that it had decided not to reverse the USITC's decision after ""careful consultations"".

Apple had asked for a stay on the ban until Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could consider whether the redesigned versions of its watches, which do not include the disputed technology, violated Masimo's patents.

CBP is due to make its decision on 12 January, according to an Apple spokesperson.

The USITC found in October that Apple infringed two patents owned by medical device maker Masimo Corporation.

The California-based company had accused Apple of poaching key staff and taking other steps to steal technology it developed to measure oxygen levels in the blood.

Most versions of Apple's smart watches have included the disputed blood oxygen feature since 2020. Its lower cost SE model do not. Previously sold watches will also not be affected by the ban.

Apple also says it has filed an emergency request to the US Court of Appeals to lift the ban.

""We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible,"" the tech giant said in a statement on Tuesday.

US news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

The lawsuit, which also names Microsoft as a defendant, says the firms should be held responsible for ""billions of dollars"" in damages.

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) ""learn"" by analysing a massive amount of data often sourced online.

The BBC has approached OpenAI and Microsoft for comment.

The lawsuit claims ""millions"" of articles published by the New York Times were used without its permission to make ChatGPT smarter, and claims the tool is now competing with the newspaper as a trustworthy information source.

It alleges that when asked about current events, ChatGPT will sometimes generate ""verbatim excerpts"" from New York Times articles, which cannot be accessed without paying for a subscription.

According to the lawsuit, this means readers can get New York Times content without paying for it - meaning it is losing out on subscription revenue as well as advertising clicks from people visiting the website.

It also gave the example of the Bing search engine - which has some features powered by ChatGPT - producing results taken from a New York Times-owned website, without linking to the article or including referral links it uses to generate income.

Microsoft has invested more than $10 billion (£7.8 billion) in OpenAI.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a Manhattan federal court, reveals the New York Times unsuccessfully approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to seek ""an amicable resolution"" over its copyright.

Multiple lawsuits

It comes a month after a period of chaos at OpenAI where co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was sacked - and then rehired - over the course of a few days.

His sacking shocked industry insiders and led to staff threatening mass resignations unless he was reinstated.

But as well as the internal issues, the firm is now facing multiple lawsuits filed in 2023.

In September a similar copyright infringement case was brought by a group of US authors including Game of Thrones novelist George RR Martin and John Grisham.

That followed legal action brought by comedian Sarah Silverman in July, as well as an open letter signed by authors Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman that same month calling for AI companies to compensate them for using their work.

And OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit alongside Microsoft - and programming site GitHub - from a group of computing experts who argue their code was used without their permission to train an AI called Copilot.

As well as these actions, there have been many cases brought against developers of so-called generative AI - that is, artificial intelligence that can create media based on text prompts - with artists suing text-to-image generators Stability AI and Midjourney in January, claiming they only function by being trained on copyrighted artwork.","New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI for ‘billions’By Tom Gerken Technology reporterGetty ImagesUS news organisation the New York Times is suing ChatGPT-owner OpenAI over claims its copyright was infringed to train the system.

By Nadia Ragozhina BBC News

DIMITAR DILKOFF/Getty images

The Eiffel Tower in Paris closed to the public on Wednesday because of a strike by staff.

Employees were protesting about the way the Tower was being managed, France's powerful CGT union said.

The date of their strike was not picked at random: 27 December is the centenary of the death of the tower's creator, Gustave Eiffel.

A visionary French engineer and entrepreneur, Eiffel died on this day in 1923, at the age of 91.

Completed in 1889, the so-called Iron Lady remains one of the world's prime tourist attractions, attracting 5.85 million visitors last year, 7% of them from the UK alone.

Tower operator SETE apologised for the strike, which it said was due to part of the staff, adding that the esplanade beneath and surrounding the structure remained open. Any visitors with electronic tickets should check their email, it said.

The hard-left CGT union said that staff had decided on a strike because SETE was ""heading for disaster"", with an economic model that was ""over-ambitious and untenable"", under-estimating the annual number of visitors as well as the costs of maintenance and renovation.

The top floor of the Eiffel Tower is due to close next month for an annual makeover lasting several weeks.

The strike will not dampen the spirits of those who want to celebrate the iconic monument and the centenary of its creator's death.

A sound and light concert will be broadcast on TV and social media on Wednesday night from the first floor of the Tower, as a tribute to Gustave Eiffel.

French President Emmanuel Macron paid homage to the engineer in a post on X, formerly Twitter: ""100 years since Gustave Eiffel left us. But his legacy to the world is very much alive!""

Eiffel, a civil engineer, made his name building bridges and viaducts for the French railway network and contributed to the building of the Statue of Liberty.

However, he was best known for the tower, which was designed to show off France's modern industrial prowess on a world stage, as the centrepiece of the 1889 Paris Exposition, or world's fair.

Built in little more than two years, it was at the time the tallest building in the world and soon became a defining image of the French capital.

By Mike Wendling BBC News

Mr Trump held a campaign event in Iowa shortly after the Colorado court decision was announced

Police in Colorado are investigating threats made against judges who ruled Donald Trump cannot be listed on the state's presidential primary ballot.

Denver Police said they were providing extra patrols around the homes of justices in the city.

The Denver FBI office said it was assisting local police.

Colorado's Supreme Court ruled last week that Mr Trump is ineligible under a US Constitution clause that bars candidates who engage in insurrection.

Mr Trump and his campaign criticised the 4-3 decision, calling it ""deeply flawed"", and his campaign has vowed to appeal to the US Supreme Court.

The ruling relied on Section 3 of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which was enacted after the US Civil War to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power in the reunified country.

The provision states that any official who ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" is disqualified from holding federal office.

The majority on the Colorado court ruled that Mr Trump's actions during the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 amounted to insurrection.

After news of the ruling came out, a slew of threats against the judges were posted online, according to Advance Democracy, a non-partisan research group that monitors pro-Trump networks.

Some of the posts included personal details, such as the addresses and phone numbers of the judges, the group said.

Threats to hang and shoot the judges were posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as the messaging service Telegram, the Trump-owned Truth Social network and several other fringe websites. Some have been taken down, while some were still live on Tuesday.

Among calls for peaceful protests and political action, there were also explicit calls for violence.

One user wrote: ""If you live in Colorado, do what the founding fathers ACTUALLY would want. Grab your rifles and some rope.""

In a statement, Denver Police said it would ""thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment"" but declined to provide further details, citing privacy concerns and the ongoing inquiries.

Daniel J Jones, Advance Democracy's president, warned that he has observed ""significant violent language and threats being made against the Colorado justices and others perceived to be behind Colorado's Supreme Court ruling"".

""The normalisation of this type of violent rhetoric is cause for significant concern and it's appropriate for law enforcement to respond with protective actions,"" he added.

Alongside threats and warnings of violence and ""civil war"", there were also unevidenced allegations that the extreme rhetoric was a ""trap"" or ""false flag"" designed to goad law-abiding Trump supporters into committing violence.

One user wrote ""I know it's all a trap,"" but said they would still ""cheer"" if the justices were victims of targeted violence.

The Colorado case was brought by a liberal watchdog group and a collection of anti-Trump Republican and independent voters.

Mr Trump has until 4 January to appeal the Colorado ruling, and legal experts say that it will have a tough time withstanding the scrutiny of the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court.

Mr Trump's Republican challengers have rallied around him on the issue, and Democrats are concerned that the court ruling will further fuel the former president's insistence he is being unfairly targeted by the judicial system.

Trump himself posted dozens of times on Truth Social over the holiday weekend, criticising the Colorado decision and the many other legal cases against him.","FBI investigate threats against Colorado judges who ruled against Donald TrumpBy Mike Wendling BBC NewsGetty ImagesMr Trump held a campaign event in Iowa shortly after the Colorado court decision was announcedPolice in Colorado are investigating threats made against judges who ruled Donald Trump cannot be listed on the state's presidential primary ballot.

A bronze statue of Colombian singer Shakira has been unveiled in her hometown of Barranquilla.

The 6.5m-tall (21.3ft) bronze shows her swivelling her hips in the dance move which featured heavily in her popular Hips Don't Lie video.

The artist shared photos of her parents in front of the statue on her Instagram account.

Shakira was among the names most searched on Google, according to figures released by the company.

Before the unveiling of the new statue, Shakira hit the news several times this year - most notably when she released a song about her former partner, ex-footballer Gerard Piqué, which broke YouTube records in Latin America.

And again when she settled a tax fraud case brought against her in Spain by paying a €7.5m (£6.5m) fine.

The unveiling of the statue on Tuesday was attended by Shakira's parents, William Mebarak and Nidia Ripoll, as well as by the mayor of Barranquilla.

A plaque at the foot of the statue praises the artist for her ""hips that do not lie, a unique talent, a voice that moves masses"".

It also refers to her charity work through a foundation she created called ""Pies descalzos"", Spanish for ""bare feet"", which promotes early childhood development.

Wolfgang Schäuble was finance minister under Angela Merkel for eight years

German ex-finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who helped steer the eurozone through the debt crisis, has died at the age of 81.

An MP for 51 years in Germany's Bundestag, he played a key role in negotiating German reunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

He then survived an attempt on his life by a mentally unstable gunman.

And although never chancellor, Schäuble was widely viewed as one of Germany's most influential post-war politicians.

Current Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he had shaped his country for more than half a century and Germany had lost ""a sharp thinker, a passionate politician and a pugnacious Democrat"".

Angela Merkel, whose cabinet he served in for 12 years, said when she was a young minister Wolfgang Schäuble was her ""political mentor"".

Posting on X, formerly Twitter, Former UK Chancellor George Osborne praised Schäuble as ""a great man, who had unified his country and was the last of the post-war Germans"".

For many Greeks, however, he was a hate figure during the eurozone debt crisis, as architect of a highly unpopular austerity programme imposed on their country. Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said history would ""judge him harshly"".

Wolfgang Schäuble joined the conservative CDU party in 1965 and entered the Bundestag seven years later when he was 30.

As interior minister of West Germany, he co-signed the treaty in East Berlin that unified the country in August 1990. He later called reunification ""the high point of my political life"".

Nine days after Germany was formally reunited, he was shot in the spinal cord and jaw during an election campaign event and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

He returned to the public stage months later with an impassioned call for the reunified country's capital to be moved from Bonn to Berlin.

He went on to lead the CDU in 1998, until Angela Merkel took over in 2000 in the middle of a party donations scandal.

On becoming Germany's chancellor in 2005, she appointed him first as interior minister then later as finance minister, where he spent eight years focused on balancing the German budget.

He achieved Germany's so-called schwarze Null or black zero budget deficit in 2014 and he was widely viewed as the driving force behind the austerity policies adopted by the eurozone in response to the debt crisis that began in 2008.

""Greece's debt crisis and the crises it generated offer a clear warning to European policymakers not to allow public debt to pile up indefinitely,"" he told the European Parliament in 2011.

His no-nonsense approach to the eurozone crisis led him to proposing a Greek ""time-out"" from the euro, although that was rejected by Athens.

As Greece took on three international bail-out loans, taxes rose, salaries and pensions were slashed and unemployment soared.

Leaving government in 2017, Schäuble became president of the Bundestag. He was its longest-serving MP, winning 14 constituency elections.

In a speech to the European Parliament four years ago, Wolfgang Schäuble said that without European unification, east and west, there would have been no German reunification, and he warned that the ""rules-based international order was under pressure"".

A Japanese luxury department store has apologised for delivering hundreds of collapsed strawberry Christmas cakes.

Some 807 out of around 2,900 strawberry cakes delivered in the run-up to Christmas were damaged on arrival, sparking a social media backlash.

Takashimaya, Japan's answer to Harrods, said it had ""betrayed the expectations of many"" and was taking responsibility.

Senior managing director Kazuhisa Yokoyama bowed deeply at a news conference in Tokyo to show remorse.

Takashimaya said on Wednesday that the cakes were made and frozen by Win's Ark, a confectionery firm in the city of Saitama. A separate company, Yamato Transport, handled the delivery.

However, an internal investigation has failed to determine why the cakes arrived in various stages of collapse.

Only about 1% of Japan's population are Christians, but many in the country celebrate Christmas by exchanging gifts and sharing festive meals with loved ones.

The colours red and white, as in a strawberry cake, represent celebration. Aside from cakes, the Japanese also serve KFC fried chicken on Christmas Eve.

Takashimaya's strawberry shortcake has layers of chiffon and fresh strawberries, covered in white icing that is carefully piped to resemble the frilled hem of a dress. The cakes cost 5,400 yen ($38; £29) each.

But many of the cakes were sent to customers in a less than picture-perfect state.

Photos shared on social media showed sliced strawberries sliding off melted icing and messed-up chiffon layers.

One user on X, formerly Twitter, said the cake arrived in a collapsed state, which they then tried to camouflage with fruits and chocolate sprinkles. The post has so far gained 16.1 million views.

Referring to the redecorated cake, one X user said: ""It is the foundation of free creation.""""The idea of ​​decorating it is wonderful. You have the best wit to shake it off and enjoy it,"" another user said.

Stanley Kakubo has vowed to clear his name

Zambia's Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo has quit after he was allegedly caught on video receiving a stack of cash from a Chinese businessman.

He did not deny he was in the video.

Instead, Mr Kakubo said he was facing ""malicious claims over a business transaction"" and had resigned so that the government was not ""distracted"" by the controversy.

The video shows two men sitting by a table counting the neatly stacked cash, both US dollars and Zambian kwacha.

Their faces are not visible, but it led to a frenzy of speculation on social media that the men were Mr Kakubo and a Chinese businessman.

Some people questioned why a bank transfer had not been made and whether taxes had been paid following the transaction.

Unverified images of signed handwritten notes also surfaced on social media. One said that $100,000 had been ""exchanged"" between a Zambian and a Chinese mining company. Another, dated 8 July 2022, mentioned a total sum of $200,000.

In his resignation letter, Mr Kakubo did not dispute the authenticity of the video or the handwritten notes.

Instead, he said he was the victim of ""malicious claims over a business transaction between my private family business and our business partner with whom we still have good relations"".

He said he had resigned as a minister to ensure that the government was not ""distracted"" from its efforts to improve the lives of Zambians, but he would remain an MP.

""In due course, we will provide the accurate context surrounding the recent developments,"" the Lusaka Times news site quoted Mr Kakubo as saying.

Mr Hichilema accepted his resignation, saying he acknowledged Mr Kakubo's ""commendable work and leadership"".

This is the second time that Mr Kakubo has found himself at the centre of controversy.

Last year, he was accused of receiving a bribe after he was spotted leaving the office of a Chinese-owned cement company with a briefcase.

He denied any wrongdoing, while the president defended him, saying he had received a calendar and a diary.

Chinese companies are major investors in Zambia.

The Chinese embassy said in 2022 that more than 600 Chinese businesses had invested more than $3bn in Zambia.

Mr Kakubo is the first minister forced to resign since President Hakainde Hichilema took office in August 2021.

Mr Hichilema pledged to fight corruption, but the opposition accuses him of unfairly targeting its members, which he denies.

In his response to Mr Kakubo's resignation, ex-President Edgar Lungu said he should be investigated for alleged corruption.","Zambia's Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo resigns over cash-on-table videoBy Kennedy Gondwe BBC News, LusakaGetty ImagesStanley Kakubo has vowed to clear his nameZambia's Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo has quit after he was allegedly caught on video receiving a stack of cash from a Chinese businessman.

By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney

Mikkel Vang

Renowned Australian chef Bill Granger - the ""godfather"" of avocado toast - has died.

A self-taught cook from Melbourne, Granger became a celebrated global restaurateur and food writer.

He passed away in a London hospital on Christmas Day, aged 54, his wife and three daughters by his side.

""He will be remembered as the 'King of Breakfast', for making unpretentious food into something special filled with sunshine,"" they said on Instagram.

""He will be deeply missed by all.""

His cause of death has not been made public by his family.

Over his 30-year career, Granger published 14 cookbooks, made multiple television cooking shows, opened more than a dozen restaurants around the world, and won legions of fans - many his own peers.

Celebrities including Australian actor Hugh Jackman, former Masterchef Australia judge Matt Preston and culinary legend Jamie Oliver were among those who paid tribute to the star as a kind, lively and charming man.

""He was the loveliest man, and the joy he gave us - whether through his food, his books, the spaces he made for us or in person - came from the kindness and generosity and sheer, shining exuberance of his very self,"" food author and TV chef Nigella Lawson wrote on Instagram.

""So devastated for his family. It's too cruel.""

Granger began his career in 1993, after he dropped out of art school to open his first restaurant in Sydney when he was just 23 years old.

Bills - a sunny corner cafe - became renowned for simple dishes like avocado toast, ricotta pancakes with honeycomb butter, and top-quality coffee.

Its popularity exploded, and from there he opened more cafes in Japan, Korea and London with offshoot chain Granger & Co.

Australian chef Darren Robertson said Granger had ""changed the entire breakfast game"", while Masterchef Australia alumnus Adam Liaw described him as ""arguably [the] most influential pioneer of modern Australian food"".

""His 'sunny'... codification of Australian cafe culture at Bills is the model on which every Australian cafe around the world is now built. Great guy, too,"" Liaw wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Such was his impact that in January, Granger was recognised with the Medal of the Order of Australia - one of the country's top honours - for his contribution to tourism and hospitality.

Speaking to the BBC in 2019, the chef reflected on the humble foundations of his breakfast empire.

""I've done all these extraordinary things, just from liking to cook pancakes and scrambled eggs, which is pretty amazing.""

Granger is one of the people credited with the popularity of avocado and toast.

He recommended using an avocado that had been left to ripen for two to three days, before scooping it out its skin with a tablespoon in one smooth movement. It should then be chopped into egg-shaped chunks, he said.

""Just crush it on the sourdough toast yourself, and always serve with citrus - lemon or lime - and good sea salt, and coriander for freshness,"" he told the Australian Financial Review.

Granger is survived by his wife and business partner, Natalie Elliott, and his three daughters, Edie, Inès and Bunny.","'Godfather' of avocado toast Bill Granger dies, aged 54By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, SydneyMikkel VangRenowned Australian chef Bill Granger - the ""godfather"" of avocado toast - has died.

Incidents similar to the one in Karnataka have made headlines in recent years

Earlier this month, a woman was stripped and paraded naked in India, sparking outrage. It's a depressingly familiar headline, but legal experts and gender rights activists say the law is still not equipped to deal with such heinous crimes against women.

Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing.

It was sometime after 1am on 11 December when more than a dozen people barged into Sasikala's [not her real name] house.

The 42-year-old was dragged out, stripped and paraded naked around the village, tied to an electricity pole and beaten for hours.

A resident of Hosa Vantamuri village in Belagavi district in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, she was being punished because her 24-year-old son had eloped with his 18-year-old girlfriend.

The young woman had been betrothed by her family to another man and was to get married the next day. Her furious family wanted to know where the couple were.

The police reached the village around 4am after they received a tip-off and rescued Sasikala and took her to hospital. She's reported to be suffering from severe trauma. Her husband later told a visiting state minister that ""my wife and I didn't even know about the relationship"".

More than a dozen people have been arrested and a local police officer has been suspended for ""dereliction of duty"".

The incident made national headlines and authorities took notice. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah called it an ""inhuman act"" and promised justice to her.

The government also gave her some agricultural land and money, although authorities have acknowledged there could be no compensation for the humiliation she endured.

Karnataka high court Chief Justice Prasanna Varale and Justice MGS Kamal, who summoned the police and initiated a hearing on their own, said they were ""shocked"" that such an incident could take place in modern India.

But the incident in Belagavi is not really rare and several similar incidents have made headlines in India in recent years.

Protests in Delhi after two Kuki tribal women were stripped and paraded naked in Manipur in July 2023

One such story that sparked global outrage came from the north-eastern state of Manipur in July. A viral video showed two women being dragged and groped by a mob of men before one of them was allegedly gang-raped.

The horrific attack had a political angle - Manipur was gripped by violent ethnic clashes involving the Kuki and Meitei communities.

But reports from other states show such incidents are often rooted in caste or familial conflicts, with women's bodies routinely becoming the battleground.

In August, a 20-year-old pregnant woman was paraded naked in Rajasthan by her husband and in-laws after she reportedly left him for another man. A 23-year-old tribal woman in Gujarat was punished in a similar manner for eloping with another man in July 2021.

In May 2015, five Dalit women were paraded naked and caned by members of a higher caste in Uttar Pradesh after one of their girls eloped with a Dalit boy. In 2014, a 45-year-old woman in Rajasthan was paraded naked on a donkey after being accused of killing her nephew.

These are just some cases that made headlines, but there's a general lack of data on such incidents. Some cases get politicised, with opposition parties raising them to embarrass a state government. But activists say women often do not report these crimes because of fear of insensitive questioning by the police and in courts.

""Cases involving assault of women are always under-reported because of shame. Families don't come forward because it's a matter of honour and the system does not support the survivors or give them a safe space to report these crimes,"" says lawyer and rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.

In the National Crime Records Bureau database, disrobing is recorded under a broad description called ""assault with intent to outrage [a woman's] modesty"", which clubs the crime with cases of street harassment, sexual gestures, voyeurism and stalking. Last year, 83,344 such cases were recorded with 85,300 affected women.

Such cases are dealt with under article 354 of the Indian Penal Code and are punishable by a mere three to seven years in jail - which, Ms Chauhan says, is ""grossly inadequate"".

""It's a mockery of justice. Law works only when it deters. Right now this law is not a deterrent and that undermines women. It needs to be amended to enhance the punishment,"" she says.

Activists say cases involving sexual assault of women are always under-reported because of shame

In the Karnataka high court, the justices also noted that the assault in Belagavi was watched by ""a crowd of 50-60 villagers"", adding that ""only one man tried to intervene and he was also beaten up"".

Highlighting the need for ""collective responsibility"" to stop such atrocities, the judges cited a case from the 1830s - when India was governed by the British - pointing out that an entire village was made to pay for a crime.

""All village people should be made responsible... Somebody could have tried to stop that,"" they said.

Chief Justice Varale also invoked Draupadi from the epic Mahabharat, who's saved by Hindu god Krishna when she's being disrobed, to advise women ""to pick up arms as no god will come to protect you"".

That advice, Ms Chauhan believes, is not practical.

""We are not Draupadis and there are no weapons to be picked up. Also, the onus cannot be on women. The law has to talk to the wrongdoer, but it's still telling women that they have to find a way to stay safe,"" she says.

""The message we need to get across is stop fighting your ethnic, caste and family battles on our bodies, they are not your battlefield,"" she adds.

Maumil Mehraj, a research analyst who works with young people on gender equity, says the reason a woman's body is treated as a battlefield is because it's connected to her - and by extension her family, caste and community's - honour.

""It's always why women disproportionately have to bear the brunt during conflicts,"" she says.

Such incidents, she says, also have an element of voyeurism because they are seen, photographed and filmed.

In Belagavi, she says, one of those arrested is a minor, indicating that such crimes have been normalised to such an extent that even the next generation has grown up with entrenched gender ideas.

""So will a law be enough to deal with such cases? I think the only solution is bringing up better boys. It's necessary to teach them that connecting a woman's body to her honour is problematic,"" she says.

""It's a Herculean task, but has to start early. Otherwise this vicious violence against women will continue.""

By Ismail Einashe Letter from Africa series, Nairobi

Artist Galal Yousif managed to flee Sudan when conflict erupted earlier this year with only a few belongings stuffed into a small backpack. The turmoil and bag, in which he had crammed his passport, two pairs of jeans, five shirts and a car key, is depicted in his painting Man With a Heavy Heart.

He first created the work as a mural in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, which he reached after a harrowing journey in June.

Having now found temporary refuge in Kenya, he has recreated it on canvas - a striking image of a man with a hand over his heart, surrounded by large circular red dots resembling gunshot wounds.

A moon shines behind his head and lying on the ground is the backpack - symbolising all that Sudanese people have lost in the eight-month conflict. He had initially packed his car key thinking he would be back home soon.

""I paint my pain,"" he tells me in his home-cum-studio in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.

As an artist, he says his mission is to turn his personal experience into a collective visual narrative, offering a powerful glimpse into the ""many people lost"" in Sudan and the heavy toil of a ""useless war"".

The conflict began in April when two generals in the ruling junta fell out - pitting the army against the formidable paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The fighting has since forced around seven million people from their homes, the UN says.

Yousif heard the first signs of war while working late towards the end of Ramadan in his studio near the presidential palace in Sudan's capital.

In the early hours of 15 April, he noticed troops massing nearby. Sensing something was about to happen, he decided to drive back to his family's home in the north of Khartoum - reaching there just before dawn after which the fighting started.

Galal Yousif has been in daily contact with his family in Rufa'ah until communications were cut last week

""Chaotic days"" followed, he says, as there was no water, electricity and little food - and he struggled to care for his elderly aunt and uncle and other relatives.

Every night he heard the sounds of planes and gunfire and could see large plumes of smoke descending over the city - prompting him to take the decision to leave.

He hoped it was a temporary move - managing to get bus tickets for all the family to head to their ancestral home in the city of Rufa'ah - around 150km (93 miles) south-east of Khartoum.

As the situation deteriorated and with his relatives too frail to travel further, Yousif realised that as a well-established artist he could do more to support them if he headed to Nairobi. So he set off with his backpack on public transport to Metemma, a town on the border with Ethiopia where thousands of people were heading.

A month later he managed to get a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi where he has found a community of other Sudanese artists who had also fled the once-thriving art scene in Khartoum.

According to Khartoum art curator Rahiem Shadad, around 35 of these artists are now in the Kenyan capital, including other big names like Bakri Moaz, Yasir Algari and Hani Khalil Jawdat. Others have settled in Cairo.

Mr Shadad, who owns Khartoum's Downtown Gallery, representing many esteemed contemporary artists, tells the BBC his art space now lies in ruins.

A vast amount of artwork, including at least 165 framed paintings and 300 other pieces belonging to 60 artists, has also been lost, he says.

In recent months, the curator, who is also in Nairobi, has spearheaded numerous exhibitions of Sudanese art in the city.

He recently set up The Rest, a space for those in exile to live and work, with support from Nairobi's GoDown Arts Centre.

Despite this warm welcome by Kenya's art community, life is difficult for the Sudanese artists because of issues around asylum, lack of documents and their lack of substantial incomes.

""Some of these artists came with just $100 [£80] in their pockets,"" Mr Shadad says.

Many of them are also deeply traumatised by their experience and losing their entire catalogue.

""Emotionally and spiritually, I am not OK,"" artist Tibian Bahari tells me about not being able to return to Sudan where her father and sister still live.

Tibian Bahari, seen here at an Alliance Française exhibition in Nairobi, wants to keep the spirit and culture of Sudan alive through her art

Her aim is to keep Sudan - a ""sacred and magical land"" - alive through her work, which currently centres around depicting the country's topography.

This determination comes down to her clothing.

""I always wear my jalabiya every morning,"" she says, referring to the ankle-length, loose-fitting robe with wide long sleeves worn by both men and women in Sudan.

She feels a deep sense of ""responsibility"" to share ""truthfully"" her journey and map out the art of displacement and especially keep a space for Sudan's women artists.

Many artists were part of the civilian protest movement that prompted the overthrow of Sudan's long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Afterwards, the army initially entered into a power-sharing arrangement with civilian groups, before seizing power and the decent into war.

These artists feel their dreams have been crushed by the conflict - and that the world has forgotten them in the wake of the conflict in Gaza.

In the last week, fighting has escalated. Yousif's family has been under attack by the RSF in Rufa'ah.

Before the phone lines went down, he heard that his family, including his aunt, uncle and some of his siblings, had been forced out of their home by the RSF. They had managed to seek shelter at his grandmother's house in city centre.

""For the second time, my family has lost our home, first in Khartoum and now in Rufa'ah,"" he says, describing a city under siege.

""Nobody can go out,"" he says, adding that they are virtually prisoners unable to move around or flee.

Like his painting, Yousif feels his heart continues to bleed.

By Charlie Jones BBC News, Essex

Millane family

Grace was backpacking in New Zealand when she was murdered in December 2018

Grace Millane had dreamed of travelling the world since she was a little girl.

""I found a school project she did about New Zealand and it said 'I'm going there one day'. And she did get there,"" her mother Gillian says, proudly.

Growing up in Wickford in Essex, Grace was a livewire who made friends wherever she went.

""She was my best friend, we would always disappear to the pub for a quick drink and we would go away on holiday together,"" Gillian says.

Gillian Millane

Gillian (right) says her daughter Grace (left), who loved to travel, was her best friend

Five years ago, after graduating from the University of Lincoln, Grace set out on a year-long solo backpacking adventure across the world.

After a six-week tour of Peru, she arrived in New Zealand. Less than a fortnight later, on the eve of her 22nd birthday, she was strangled to death by a man she met on a dating app.

Grace was constantly in touch with her family but had not responded to their birthday messages on 2 December, so they reported her missing to the police.

Gillian was recovering from surgery for breast cancer and not able to join the search. Her husband, Grace's father David, flew out to New Zealand but a week later, their daughter's body was found in bushland on the outskirts of Auckland.

Millane Family

During a three-week trial, the family had to sit through her killer's attempts to pass the murder off as ""rough sex"" gone wrong and his claims that Grace asked to be strangled.

""I felt like Grace was on trial and she couldn't defend herself. As a parent, I didn't want to listen to that. It was horrendous.

""You can't ask for your own death. It is ludicrous this can be used as a defence.""

A jury unanimously convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison.

The family decided never to mention his name again. ""We never say it. It's a waste of energy. I don't care about him, I don't think about him,"" Gillian says.

Gillian has since campaigned against the rough sex defence, with the charity We Can't Consent To This, and has helped to change the law in England and Wales.

Two years after Grace's murder, Gillian's husband David died from cancer, which left her in a ""really dark place"".

Millane family

Grace was incredibly close to her parents and her two brothers

Gillian credits her family and friends, long walks and ""lots of counselling"" for her still being here today.

""I did contemplate suicide. That is a horrid place to be. But I couldn't bring any more sadness to the family. Grace had such a bright future and it was taken away from her and us.

""I will never see Grace in a wedding dress or see her grandchildren. This is a life sentence I've got. This is me until the day I die. But there is a light and I found it. You have to find that inner strength.""

John Fairhall/BBC

Gillian experienced suicidal thoughts after losing her husband and daughter but managed to find some light in the darkness

David died during Covid and they could not be together as a family but Gillian later threw a memorial party and it became a turning point.

""A friend dragged me up to dance. I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do but I laughed and I looked around the room and everyone was smiling.

""My toes stay in the darkness but the rest of me is facing the sun a bit. Sometimes it goes up to my waist and I do go into that black hole but I have people behind me who support me.""

Christmas is a very difficult time for Gillian, so last year she decided to spend it climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, which was ""incredibly emotional"".

Gillian Millane

Gillian raised more than £30,000 climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her daughter and husband

""I went from not wanting to leave the house to climbing a mountain on the other side of the world.

""I had to train and be focused. I didn't realise the power it was giving me and how much it was helping me.

""Everything was aching but I knew Grace and David would be pushing me up there. They wanted to still be here, they didn't want to go, so I thought 'right get up there'.""

Gillian left a stone for Grace and David at the top, in tribute to them.

""Whenever I go somewhere special, I put the stones there, so they are travelling. If someone picks a stone up and moves it, they go somewhere else.""

Gillian Millane

Grace left a stone for both her daughter and husband on Mount Kilimanjaro

Her efforts raised £33,000 for the White Ribbon charity, which aims to end male violence against women. Gillian received a thank you card from the charity, saying the money had been used to fund education programmes in 65 schools in the Hull area.

""I just want to raise awareness and get that message out there about violence against women so that no other family has to live this life I live,"" Gillian says.

Four years ago, with her niece Hannah, Gillian started the charity initiative Love Grace. They collect donated handbags and fill them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims.

So far, they have filled 15,600 bags for women in the UK and across the world and they received an award from the prime minister.

Hannah O'Callaghan

Grace's cousin, Hannah O'Callaghan (left), and Gillian were invited to 10 Downing Street to celebrate the award

Grace loved handbags, Gillian says, and each bag has a tag on it with her handwriting.

""It's a simple idea but it has really taken off,"" Gillian says. ""We were just doing it for our grief so that Grace would never just be a number.

""They get this bag, they are not expecting it and they have gone through hell. We get hundreds of letters from people who have received the bags, it's heartbreaking.""

John Fairhall/BBC

The bags are delivered with a tag which features Grace's handwriting and a flower that she drew

The other side of the tag has a note explaining what happened to Grace and more about the initiative

Next year, Gillian is applying for Love Grace to become an official charity and she will be training for a trek to Everest basecamp in September, with a plan to place two more stones there.

One day she hopes to travel to New Zealand, a country which Gillian says has really taken Grace to their hearts.

""I still get loads of messages of support from there. It wasn't New Zealand or travelling that killed Grace, or anything she did. It was that individual.""

Five years on from her daughter's death, living without Grace has not got any easier. But Gillian is still trying hard to face the sun.

""I should never have buried my child and certainly she should never have died the way she did. People keep saying I'm really strong but I don't think so, I'm just a mum.""

John Fairhall/BBC

Gillian hopes her daughter Grace would be proud of how she has coped since her death

She adds: ""I am more resilient than I ever thought I was. I do think David and Grace would be proud. I think Grace would laugh and say these treks are a mid-life crisis.

""I will never get over it but I just know I've got to make the world a better place. I want to change things so that no other family has to go through what we go through. That has got to be a good thing.""

If you, or someone you know, is feeling emotionally distressed, BBC Action Line has put together a list of organisations which can help.","Gillian left a stone for Grace and David at the top, in tribute to them.

By Prof Marie Coleman Queen's University Belfast

Prince Andrew was said to have a better grasp of NI affairs than Lord Mandelson, according to the papers

Prince Andrew ""smoothed over"" mistakes made by then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson at a charity event in 2000, according to just-released Irish state papers.

Among the 13,200 files just released by the National Archives of Ireland are a number which chart the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

They also cover the Patten Report.

The task of piloting the legislation to establish a new police force fell to Mo Mowlam's replacement Mr Mandelson.

He took up the role as secretary of state for Northern Ireland in October 1999 but there were concerns about his level of interest in and knowledge of Northern Ireland.

This was noticeable at a Co-operation Ireland charity event held at the Albert Hall in London in April 2000 which was compered by Patrick Kielty, who now presents RTÉ's The Late Late Show.

Lord Mandelson, as he has been known since 2008, was ""in a strange, almost detached, mood"" that evening, according to the state papers.

He embarrassed David Trimble on two occasions by confusing Harland & Wolff with Shorts and asking ""loudly"" if Kielty's father, Jack, who was shot dead by the UFF in 1988, ""had been a member of the IRA"".

The ""awkward silence"" which ensued from that comment was resolved by a diplomatic intervention from Prince Andrew who ""smoothed over the moment by remarking that there could hardly be a family in Northern Ireland that was untouched by the conflict"".

The Duke of York also had a better grasp of the Harland & Wolff/Shorts situation than Lord Mandelson and ""appeared more knowledgeable than the secretary of state about industrial policy on Northern Ireland"", the papers said.

When he was appointed, Irish diplomats based in London viewed Lord Mandelson as an unknown quantity on Northern Ireland.

He had made few public pronouncements on the subject and his knowledge of it was based largely on his experience of covering events in Northern Ireland while working as a journalist for London Weekend Television in the early 1980s. He was not known to have many friends or associates in the province, apart from the journalist, Mary Holland.

Where Dr Mowlam was seen as too close to nationalism, Lord Mandelson was expected to appear more neutral.

As a staunch Blairite, he was considered to ""be a strong supporter of the Good Friday Agreement"", though not being one of its architects, he would possibly ""be willing to look at it in a more flexible way"".

The prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, and then Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement

By early 2000 the Irish government was dissatisfied with the extent of Lord Mandelson's neutrality and flexibility. In particular, they were concerned that his equivocation on the name of the new police service and his initial refusal to commit to an entirely neutral new badge for the force constituted unacceptable deviations from Patten's recommendations.

Lord Mandelson resigned as secretary of state in January 2001, two months after the enactment of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act which established the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), replacing the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

Holy Cross

One of the last high-profile security incidents policed by the RUC before its replacement in November 2001 was the loyalist protest at Holy Cross girls' primary school in Ardoyne, north Belfast.

The archives contain detailed daily reports of the situation which began on 19 June, noting ""conflicting reports about the cause"".

Holy Cross: 'I was in the school and we heard an explosion'

Loyalists complained that a woman from their community had been prevented from accessing shops by some men, while nationalists claimed a Catholic man who had been collecting his child from school was assaulted by loyalists who were erecting paramilitary flags in the area.

The parish priest of Ardoyne, Fr Aidan Troy, identified demographic change as another contributory factor - citing a recent increase in the Catholic population of the area.

The role of loyalist paramilitaries was also significant.

Loyalists expelled from the Shankill Road during the previous year's feud had re-settled in the Glenbryn estate in Ardoyne and were ""intent on stirring things up"".

Fr Troy did not see the dispute as entirely one-sided and had personal experience of the intimidation complained of by loyalists living in the area.

The papers said: ""He himself had been stoned by young children while out jogging because they mistook his t-shirt for a Glasgow Rangers jersey.""

Early on the morning of 3 September 2001, as the school was reopening for the new school year, Fr Troy sought conciliatory talks with the local Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) MLA Billy Hutchinson.

Fr Troy was met with Mr Hutchinson's refusal to talk ""to scum like you"".

Pacemaker

Cllr Billy Hutchinson now leads the PUP

The priest attributed the vehemence of Mr Hutchinson's language to Fr Troy's role ""[a]s a priest"" but declined to specify other comments uttered to him in the ""tongue-lashing"" he received from Mr Hutchinson.

""What he called me was unrepeatable,"" said Fr Troy.

The protests were eventually suspended in November 2001 following intervention by the Northern Ireland Executive with a cross-community support package providing additional resources for schools, traffic-calming, community transport, policing and a community forum.

But a brief recurrence of violence when the school re-opened in January 2002 after the Christmas holidays showed how volatile the situation remained.

The school principal Anne Tanney ""bemoaned the fact that the name Holy Cross had become synonymous with bigotry and sectarian hatred, appearing alongside Drumcree in articles as a by-word for all that was wrong in their society"".","Irish state papers: How Prince Andrew 'smoothed over' Lord Mandelson's gaffeBy Prof Marie Coleman Queen's University BelfastGetty ImagesPrince Andrew was said to have a better grasp of NI affairs than Lord Mandelson, according to the papersPrince Andrew ""smoothed over"" mistakes made by then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson at a charity event in 2000, according to just-released Irish state papers.

By Sophie Parker BBC News, Malmesbury

BBC

Malmesbury Abbey is still significantly the same structure it was when John of Tintern was a monk there in the 1300s

When a local historian started researching his town's abbey, he expected to uncover some surprises, but the evil nature of one character made him stand out above all others.

A wayward monk known as John of Tintern had such a colourful and criminal life that Tony McAleavy felt compelled to write a whole book chapter on him.

Idyllic Malmesbury is a market town in the Cotswolds, well-known for its Norman abbey, runaway pigs and being the burial place of Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan.

But it didn't always feel so serene.

While the monastery was dissolved in the huge religious changes ordered by King Henry VIII, it had been a centre of learning for centuries and an institution with power.

Speaking to BBC Radio Wiltshire, Mr McAleavy explained John of Tintern had a ""very long criminal record,"" which first started in 1318.

He has combed through heaps of centuries-old documents in order to be able to tell his story.

Tony McAleavy was researching for his book 'Malmesbury Abbey, 670-1539' when he discovered the criminal career of John of Tintern

'A mini army'

That year John, still a young monk, was put in front of the King Edward II and accused of being in a riot: ""A mass brawl that took place in the town of Lechlade.

""He went there with 40 men from Malmesbury. A little mini army and they were engaged in some sort of argument about land and money.""

The abbey was about to start a big building programme and needed cash: ""this man is not someone spending all of his time with his prayer book. He is a man of business.""

Malmesbury Abbey as it is today is partly a product of this moment in history - the top bit was rebuilt at this point, while the bottom was already in place.

The building there now is a small, but grand, a reminder of the whole abbey, as this section stayed as a church after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1500s.

Malmesbury Abbey was having lots of building work done at the time - the top part of the building you can see was constructed in the time John of Tintern was there

Ruins of the rest of the grand monastery remain on the abbey grounds, which show the scale of the place

'Dark secret'

Then in the 1320s, the abbey became embroiled in a feud involving £10,000, which, by today's standards, would have been millions.

The monasteries at the time had political allegiances and at Malmesbury they supported a local noble family called the Despensers.

The family left a large amount of cash with the abbey for safekeeping.

However, when the tide turned against them, the head of the family was executed and the monastery decided to keep quiet about the money they had stored.

They even had a royal visit while they had the cash stashed there, likely in their living area, the only part of which remains in the basement of Abbey House in the town.

""The monks must have been terrified that they had this dark secret,"" Mr McAleavy said.

""They kept quiet about it, and then ten years later it came to light. Somebody obviously ratted on them.""

As the right-hand man of the Abbot at the time, John was hauled in front of royalty once again and placed in custody.

In the end though, the monks of Malmesbury were pardoned: ""Extraordinarily, the King took the 10,000 and let him off. Basically, they all got away with it.""

This is part of the living area of the medieval abbey, now part of the basement of Abbey House next door

'Operated as a gangster'

Mr McAleavy explained that despite being elected as the Abbey's Abbot in 1340, John of Tintern was up to much worse.

""He operated as a gangster and a gangster who was prepared to kill or have his enemies killed.""

To add to his unseemly behaviour as a monk, he was also living openly with a woman - Margaret of Lea, in a village next to Malmesbury.

He was accused of being the person to burn down the manor house her and her husband had been living in and abducting her.

It appeared to be a well-known story in the town, as local people came forward to report his crimes when the Justices travelled to Malmesbury from London.

John of Tintern became Abbot at Malmesbury, but did not behave much like one, even openly living with a woman

However, it was not only arson and abduction he was accused of - John of Tintern had ordered four murders.

Those killed were from the local gentry, some were tenants of abbey land and ""it seems that John wanted to get rid of them, so that he could give the land, give tenancies to his cronies.""

To make everything more corrupt, his ally was the Sheriff of Wiltshire himself, Gilbert of Berwick, who was supposed to be in charge of the county's law and order.

When the murders took place though, John was absent, getting a man from nearby Badminton to do the dirty work of beating and killing.

An arrest warrant was issued and they - Margaret included - went on the run.

Mr McAleavy explained that is not quite clear what happened, but they were found and put on trial in London.

It seems like this should have been the end of John of Tintern's escapades.

Mr McAleavy said a document in the Vatican archives shows that John of Tintern did have a guilty conscience later on

'They were pardoned'

""He literally got away with murder,"" Mr McAleavy said.

""The court accepted his guilt. They pardoned him in return for a massive fine so, basically he was fined for committing murder.""

It was a fine of £500, the equivalent hundreds of thousands today.

Mr McAleavy believes that money played a big part in all of this, with the Abbey undergoing lots of building work at the time and hiring one of the top architects.

'A guilty conscience'

There is evidence in the Vatican archives that John of Tintern did feel some guilt though.

He applied to the Pope for something called an ""indulgence"".

Mr McAleavy explained this meant ""approval from the Pope that at the moment of his death all his sins would be forgiven.

""That was just a standard transaction at the time in return for money.

""I think maybe he had something of a guilty conscience.""

In 1349, John of Tintern died. It is not certain how, but the Black Death was ripping through the country.

It was a long research journey for Tony McAleavy who said: ""You have to pinch yourself when you look at these documents.

""How can this possibly be true? How can this man of religion have behaved so incredibly badly?""","A wayward monk known as John of Tintern had such a colourful and criminal life that Tony McAleavy felt compelled to write a whole book chapter on him.

By Arthur Asseraf Historian, Cambridge University

BBC

Confiscated letters written to Moroccan men from Spanish women decades ago reveal a history of taboo affairs during the colonial era.

""When will you come back to Spain?"" The desperate-sounding plea had been carefully written out on the page, a sign of how important it was for Carmela.

""Tell me that you are not looking at any other women,"" she wrote from Granada in 1944.

But the man these words were intended for never got to read them. Carmela's international love letter did not make it to its destination in Morocco.

Instead, it ended up hidden deep in the Spanish archives, in an unexpected stash of hundreds of amorous messages between Spanish women and Moroccan men.

Seized between the 1930s and the 1950s, they chronicle forbidden intimate relationships.

For decades, colonial authorities of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco systematically seized this mail.

The boxes are full of words of passion: ""I am crazy for you… I am like a goat for you,"" writes one woman from Valencia.

Some contain photographs. Inserted in letter after letter, there are dozens of portraits of women with immaculate hairdos posing to remind their distant lovers what they looked like. One sent a picture of herself riding a bicycle, a carefree snapshot of everyday life.

All were neatly filed away in envelopes by conscientious bureaucrats, and then forgotten amid routine administrative documents.

They accumulated dust until they were found and published by academics Josep LluísMateo Dieste and Nieves Muriel García.

Each letter contains a tantalising glimpse into an entire relationship, but each one also tells us about the repression that these relationships faced.

Spanish officials tried everything they could to make these relationships impossible.

As one directive stated in 1937: ""As a general rule, marriages between Moroccan soldiers with Spanish women must be prevented.""

Since 1912, Spain had claimed sovereignty over part of Morocco as a protectorate, dividing the country into two zones, along with France.

Fighters form the Berber community resisted this, most notoriously in the long and bloody Rif War between 1921 and 1926, which saw the Spanish army decimated by forces led by Abdelkrim al-Khattabi.

To overcome this challenge, the Spanish government increased the number of its troops in Morocco and recruited thousands of Moroccans to serve in its army.

By the 1930s a long strip along the north of the country, from the Atlantic coast in Asilah almost up to the border with Algeria in the east, was effectively administered by Spain with its capital in Tetouan.

It was from the military bases in this territory that in 1936, Gen Francisco Franco launched a coup against the Republican government, starting the Spanish Civil War.

As the war raged on, suddenly thousands of Moroccan men conscripted into the Spanish military were sent across the sea to Spain to fight alongside Franco's forces.

Beyond the military, students, traders and other workers also joined them and ended up living around the country, in cities as well as more remote rural locations.

After all, unlike many European colonial possessions, this one lay just a stone's throw away from Spain itself - at its narrowest in the Strait of Gibraltar, the Moroccan coast is only 14km (8.5 miles) away from the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula.

Wherever they went, Moroccan men met Spanish women.

In Salamanca, a woman named Concha met Nasar, a Moroccan soldier stationed nearby.

Madly in love, she wrote to his superiors for permission to marry him in 1938. But for Spanish colonial authorities, such contact absolutely had to be banned.

They expressed disgust at Concha, who they disparaged as old, ""ugly, fat like a hippo and with a slight limp"".

They suspected that Nasar had only shown interest because Concha happened to own a house, which is what awakened his ""volcanic love"".

Official orders were to place ""as many difficulties as possible"" to prevent these relationships ""without openly banning them"", as one order put it in 1937.

Indeed, as the Franco regime relied on the loyalty of Moroccan soldiers, they did not make such relationships explicitly illegal. Instead, they developed a whole series of means to make them impossible in practice.

For example, if a woman was found to be writing to a Moroccan man, they would ban her from entering Morocco.

Often, they would also ban the Moroccan man from entering Spain, rendering their relationship impossible.

In 1948, a letter was intercepted between Carmen from Zaragoza to her lover Abdeselam in Morocco. The authorities in Tetouan immediately banned both from crossing to the opposite side.

In the letter, Carmen gave news of their daughter, who would now grow up without ever seeing her father. The officials did not take the child into consideration.

Why did they regard these relationships with such contempt?

Part of the answer lies in the dictatorship's reactionary ideology.

Franco's government was aggressively misogynistic, rigidly controlling the mobility of women and restricting their access to employment.

It also saw itself as a defender of Catholicism, and for religious reasons, women who married Muslim men were seen as ""lost to the faith"".

But the biggest single reason was what officials called ""prestigio de raza"", ""the prestige of the race"".

For colonial rule to continue, Spain had to be seen as superior to Morocco.

As the government understood marriage to be the subordination of a woman by a man, any marriage across the colonial divide would make a Spanish woman subservient to a Moroccan man.

If this came to be known, it would undermine the very basis of colonial domination.

By contrast, relationships between Spanish men and Moroccan women, which were plentiful in the protectorate, did not attract such extensive scrutiny and censorship as they reproduced the larger power structure of society on an intimate scale without threatening it.

This was not specific to Spain: the fear of European women entering into relationships with colonised men was common across all European colonial administrations.

In the neighbouring French zone, officials expressed similar disapproval for the political consequences of these relationships.

The Dutch in the East Indies and the British in India saw relationships between European women and colonised men as much more threatening than the reverse, and policed them accordingly.

While the range of measures to discourage these relationships went from disapproval to outright bans, the underlying rule was the same: such relationships were a threat.

These letters, however, reveal that beneath the surface of colonial society, encounters were common and led to a whole range of relationships: friendships, courtships, sexual encounters and marriages.

Opening them is thrilling - a window into lives that official documents rarely tell us about. But it is also unsettling - most letters never made it to their destination. It feels like an invasion of privacy, as these people never chose to be included in this archive.

When Morocco became independent in 1956, the protectorate government in Tetouan shut down and its archives were mostly forgotten.

They ended up mostly near Madrid, in the central archives of the administration in the university town of Alcalá de Henares where - like most of Spain's colonial history in Africa - they were forgotten.

But despite the recent publication of some of these letters, their stories remain poorly known, and this long-forgotten archive has not yet revealed all of its secrets.

Instead, it ended up hidden deep in the Spanish archives, in an unexpected stash of hundreds of amorous messages between Spanish women and Moroccan men.
As one directive stated in 1937: ""As a general rule, marriages between Moroccan soldiers with Spanish women must be prevented.""
Wherever they went, Moroccan men met Spanish women.
But for Spanish colonial authorities, such contact absolutely had to be banned."

APTN

Russian State TV showed destroyed buildings and Russian soldiers in what it said were the outskirts of Mariinka

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his troops have seized the key town of Mariinka in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin assault units had taken the ""powerfully fortified"" area just outside Donetsk, a Russian-held regional capital.

The commander of Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Ukrainian forces had moved to the outskirts of Mariinka.

Mariinka - seen as a gateway to Donetsk - has been almost completely destroyed.

Separately on Tuesday evening, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Russian forces had shelled Kherson railway station, killing one police lieutenant and leaving several injured.

Police were able to successfully evacuate most of the 140 civilians who had been waiting for an evacuation train at the time, he said on Telegram, most likely preventing much higher casualties.

Mariinka, once home to 10,000 people, has remained in Ukrainian hands throughout the Kremlin's war in eastern Ukraine, which began when Russia seized and annexed Crimea in 2014 and its proxy forces occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

When the full-scale invasion began in 2022, Mariinka came under relentless Russian attack and was evacuated.

""For nine years, the armed forces of Ukraine have made a powerful fortified area, which is connected by underground passages,"" Mr Shoigu said, adding that this fortified area had now been cracked.

""Each street has its own well-fortified and fairly well-protected structures from all attacks, both from the air and artillery, long-term firing points, complex underground communication systems.""

Mr Putin hailed the reported capture as ""success"", saying that Ukrainian troops had now been pushed further away from Donetsk, which they have been regularly shelling from Mariinka.

The Kremlin leader also said Russian forces now had the ""opportunity to move into a wider operational area"" in the Donetsk region.

The Ukrainian military initially denied the Russian claim and Ukrainian military bloggers reported that Ukrainian troops were holding out in a small area of western Mariinka.

But speaking during a news conference on Tuesday, the commander of Ukrainian Armed Forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi confirmed that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn.

""We protect every piece of our land. Every piece. But when, on this narrow piece, enemy shells start to dig this place together with stones, with earth, with our soldiers, the lives of our soldiers are more important to us,"" he said.

Gen Zaluzhnyi noted that Mariinka had been held for almost two years, but it was destroyed ""street by street, house by house.""

""Mariinka is no more,"" he added.

The town has been used by Ukraine as a defensive barrier since 2014, when Russia-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Telegram via Reuters

Mariinka looks like a ghost town after months of fierce fighting (file image from May 2023)

In recent weeks, Russian forces have intensified their attacks in several key areas of a more than 1,200km-long (745 miles) battlefront.

Alongside Mariinka, they have been trying to encircle Avdiivka - another key town near Donetsk.

Ukrainian forces are seeking to extend their bridgehead on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine.

Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's military were planning to mobilise up to 500,000 extra people - although Gen Zaluzhnyi denied on Tuesday that the military had issued a request for any specific number of troops.

President Zelensky's comments come as Ukraine is facing an ammunition shortage amid aid setbacks from its key allies in the US and the EU.

Kyiv's counter-offensive ground to a halt at the start of winter and there are fears that the Russians could simply outgun Ukraine.

But there was some good news for Ukraine on Tuesday, as Russia's defence ministry confirmed that one of its warships was damaged in a Ukrainian attack on the port of Feodosiya in occupied Crimea. One person was killed, officials said.

The head of the Ukrainian Air Force said warplanes had destroyed the landing ship Novocherkassk, used for moving troops and heavy equipment, in the early hours of Tuesday.

Mr Shoigu gave details on Tuesday of the damage to the ship to President Vladimir Putin, before declaring that Russian forces had brought Ukraine's counter-offensive to a halt and were now pushing forward on all fronts.","Ukraine war: Russia captures key town near DonetskAPTNRussian State TV showed destroyed buildings and Russian soldiers in what it said were the outskirts of MariinkaRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his troops have seized the key town of Mariinka in eastern Ukraine.

BBC

Ncuti Gatwa takes over as the Time Lord

All eyes will be on new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but he does not think he will be the biggest star of Doctor Who's Christmas special.

Instead, the Rwanda-born Scottish actor joked he was angry Davina McCall's cameo ""steals the show"" and pointed to the setting in ""mythical"" Wales.

He also praised Swansea-born writer Russell T Davies for ""whipping up"" the ""fresh and scary"" world it is set in.

The Christmas special - Gatwa's first full episode - airs on Christmas Day.

While the role may be new for the 31-year-old, the setting is very familiar, having spent the best part of five years filming in Wales for Sex Education and as the Time Lord since February.

He jokingly thanked the country for ""welcoming me and consistently employing me"", and described why he thought it provided the perfect backdrop.

Tenby was one of the locations that captured the imagination of the new Doctor

""Wales is just the most beautiful country, like ridiculously so at times,"" he told BBC Radio Wales.

""And I can see why they film Doctor Who here, because there's something almost mythical about some of the landscapes in Wales.

""There's a place where we shot the beginning of episode four of Doctor Who. Tenby, 'loads of people go there for their caravan holidays,' they said to me. What a stunning place. And you guys just have that for free.""

Southerndown Beach, near Bridgend, Cardiff Bay, Caerphilly Castle and Margam Country Park all pop up in the 14th series, set to air in 2024.

Journalist Catriona Aitken takes a whistle-stop tour around some Doctor Who backdrops in Wales

Doctor Who fans got a short first glimpse of the 15th Doctor in a special episode earlier this month.

He normally transforms - or ""regenerates - into his next incarnation.

However, viewers briefly saw Gatwa alongside the previous Doctor, David Tennant.

Wales mixed with festive scenery such as snow was used to create the backdrop to the Christmas special

The Barbie movie star is now set to have the spotlight shone solely on him - but he thinks this may not be the case on Christmas Day.

He points to a cameo by TV presenter Davina McCall, saying: ""She steals the show.

""I'm very angry, but she's an absolute diamond in the show. It's such a perfect Christmas adventure.""

The 15th Doctor hits the dancefloor in the Christmas special

While it will be new territory for Gatwa, the new series heralds a return for a man central to the success of the show in recent times.

Russell T Davies was head writer of the revival of the BBC sci-fi drama from 2005 to 2010, with the new series his first involvement since.

Gatwa said of his input: ""He is whipping up a world that is so exciting, and new and fresh, and scary and deep and dark and so much fun as well.""

As the show celebrates its 60th anniversary, he believes the longevity is down to writers such as Davies being able to reflect society in the UK and around the world.

""He is able to channel issues and conversations and where we are in the world through the power of his pen and this is what he's doing on this show,"" Gatwa added.

""And so I think it's really important that the show continues to be a bit of a mirror to us and who we are as humans.""

Gatwa takes over the role previously filled by fellow Scot David Tennant

Perhaps the success is also down to the personal attachment many feel to it - as Gatwa described Doctor Who as a show he loves ""as do we all in this country"".

""And the character was one that I felt the relationship with,"" he added.

""I feel like, the Doctor's like a member of our family, like we've all grown up with him.

""It's like a piece of furniture in the house. And so I always knew that I liked that piece of furniture. And I was like, I would like to be that piece of furniture.""

Ncuti Gatwa is the long-running sci-fi show's 15th Doctor

While many people will no doubt be watching his first appearance as the Time Lord on Christmas Day after eating and drinking too much, Gatwa enjoyed the moment in slightly different circumstances after having the episode sent to his phone.

He said: ""I came back, because I'm such a rock star, from the gym. And I watched it on my own. I put my phone in airplane mode. I sent my flatmate out. And then watched it on my own.

""And then as it got to the bit where I was going to like pop out, I had to pause the screen, go for a little walk, poured myself a glass of something, have a little breather, and then switched it back on.

""God, my heart was just racing with nerves, anticipation, just feeling sick, but feeling excited.""","Doctor Who: Welsh landscapes the perfect backdrop, says Ncuti GatwaBy Chris Wood & Sonia Mathur BBC NewsBBCNcuti Gatwa takes over as the Time LordAll eyes will be on new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but he does not think he will be the biggest star of Doctor Who's Christmas special.

Mr Trump's place on the ballot in Michigan was never thought to be in danger

Michigan's supreme court has refused to hear an appeal by voters in the US state to disqualify Donald Trump from next year's presidential primary.

They sought to invoke a clause in the US Constitution, barring anyone who has engaged in insurrection, over Mr Trump's role in the 2021 Capitol riots.

The decision comes days after Colorado became the first state to rule that Mr Trump was not an eligible candidate.

Michigan is considered a battleground state in the 2024 general election.

Traditionally voting Democrat, it supported Mr Trump, a Republican, in his successful 2016 presidential campaign, but then reverted to current President Joe Biden in 2020.

Pro-democracy advocacy group Free Speech for People filed the lawsuit in September.

But unlike in Colorado, the bid failed early on in the process, and the appeal to the supreme court was seen as having little chance of success.

Courts in Michigan rejected the case on procedural grounds and did not examine the question of whether 6 January 2021 was an insurrection and whether Mr Trump played a part in it.

Supreme Court justice Elizabeth Welch explained that Michigan's laws were different from Colorado's.

The appellants ""have identified no analogous provision in the Michigan Election Law that requires someone seeking the office of President of the United States to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office"", she wrote.

Colorado's 4-3 supreme court decision last week, which refers only to the state primary on 5 March, does not stop Mr Trump from running in other states.

It is the first-ever use of Section 3 of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment to disqualify a presidential candidate. The measure was ratified after the American Civil War to block secessionists from returning to previous government roles once southern states rejoined the Union.","Trump election: Michigan supreme court rejects ballot disqualification bidBy Robert Greenall BBC NewsReutersMr Trump's place on the ballot in Michigan was never thought to be in dangerMichigan's supreme court has refused to hear an appeal by voters in the US state to disqualify Donald Trump from next year's presidential primary.

South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun

South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun, best known for his role in the Oscar-winning film Parasite, has been found dead in an apparent suicide in central Seoul.

Police found the body of the actor, who was 48, in a car near a city park on Wednesday. They believe Lee took his own life, Yonhap news agency reports.

Police said earlier they had received a report that he had left his home after writing a note.

He had been under investigation for alleged illegal drug use since October.

Lee's body was taken to Seoul National University Hospital after police located his car near Waryong Park. Reports say his family have refused an autopsy and he will be buried on Friday.

Police have begun an investigation to establish the details around his death, including when he arrived at the scene where his body was found, and the time of his death.

In Parasite, Lee played the patriarch of the wealthy Park family which is infiltrated by members of a poor family posing as unrelated individuals. The vicious social satire won four Oscars, including best picture.

Yonhap reported that he was suspected of taking drugs such as marijuana and ketamine with a hostess at a bar in Seoul. He had said that though he took what she gave him, he had not known that they were illicit drugs.

The hostess had reportedly told the police that he used drugs at her home multiple times - something he denied. He had earlier requested through his lawyer to take a lie detector test.

His drug tests had returned negative or inconclusive results, the report added.

Police said they regretted that Lee had died in the midst of investigations, but that the inquiry had been ""conducted with [his] consent"", News1 Korea reported. Lee underwent three rounds of questioning, with one session last Saturday lasting 19 hours, according to Yonhap.

Lee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, said in a statement: ""There is no way to contain the sorrow and despair. We respectfully ask that you refrain from spreading false facts based on speculation... so that [Lee's] final journey will not be unfair.""

News of his death sparked strong reactions online.

""I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for him. Rest in peace,"" read a comment on one of the news reports.

""Aren't celebrities human? People can make mistakes in their lives. It's so sad,"" said another.

There was also praise for his work.

One fan, writing on X (formerly Twitter), wrote: ""I laughed and cried a lot while watching your acting. Thank you.""

The actor, who was married to actress Jeon Hye-jin and had two young sons with her, had a career spanning more than two decades.

He starred as the lead in dozens of films and TV shows, becoming a household name through the 2010s.

He rose to international fame with Parasite, as it became the first non-English language film to win the Best Picture Oscar.

In South Korea, celebrities are held to high standards of propriety.

Lee had a squeaky-clean, family-man image prior to his alleged drug use, but reports that emerged from the investigation caused considerable damage to his reputation.

Speaking to reporters in late October before going into a police station for questioning, he said: ""I sincerely apologise for causing great disappointment to many people by being involved in such an unpleasant incident.

""I feel sorry for my family, which is enduring such difficult pain at this moment.""

Lee was dropped from No Way Out, a mystery TV series that began shooting in October. According to reports, some businesses were seen taking down posters and advertisements featuring Lee from their stores.

Drug offences, including those involving usage of marijuana, are considered serious crimes in South Korea. Consumption of marijuana carries prison sentences of up to five years.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed a crackdown on drugs. This year, the country's authorities expanded its drug crimes department and the national police chief promised ""a total war"" on drug crimes.

Lee is not the only South Korean celebrity who had been investigated for drug use recently. Earlier this month, K-pop star G-Dragon was cleared of drug allegations after weeks of investigations.

Actor Yoo Ah-in is currently standing trial for drug use.

The statue was unveiled in Shakira's hometown, Barranquilla

A bronze statue of Colombian singer Shakira has been unveiled in her hometown of Barranquilla.

The 6.5m-tall (21.3ft) bronze shows her swivelling her hips in the dance move which featured heavily in her popular Hips Don't Lie video.

The artist shared photos of her parents in front of the statue on her Instagram account.

Shakira was among the names most searched on Google, according to figures released by the company.

Before the unveiling of the new statue, Shakira hit the news several times this year - most notably when she released a song about her former partner, ex-footballer Gerard Piqué, which broke YouTube records in Latin America.

And again when she settled a tax fraud case brought against her in Spain by paying a €7.5m (£6.5m) fine.

The unveiling of the statue on Tuesday was attended by Shakira's parents, William Mebarak and Nidia Ripoll, as well as by the mayor of Barranquilla.

A plaque at the foot of the statue praises the artist for her ""hips that do not lie, a unique talent, a voice that moves masses"".

It also refers to her charity work through a foundation she created called ""Pies descalzos"", Spanish for ""bare feet"", which promotes early childhood development.

Shakira thanked the sculptor, Yino Márquez, and his students for the ""enormous artistic talent"" they had demonstrated by creating the bronze.","Huge Shakira statue unveiled in her hometown of BarranquillaBy Vanessa Buschschlüter BBC NewsAFPThe statue was unveiled in Shakira's hometown, BarranquillaA bronze statue of Colombian singer Shakira has been unveiled in her hometown of Barranquilla.

A Japanese luxury department store has apologised for delivering hundreds of collapsed strawberry Christmas cakes.

Some 807 out of around 2,900 strawberry cakes delivered in the run-up to Christmas were damaged on arrival, sparking a social media backlash.

Takashimaya, Japan's answer to Harrods, said it had ""betrayed the expectations of many"" and was taking responsibility.

Senior managing director Kazuhisa Yokoyama bowed deeply at a news conference in Tokyo to show remorse.

Takashimaya said on Wednesday that the cakes were made and frozen by Win's Ark, a confectionery firm in the city of Saitama. A separate company, Yamato Transport, handled the delivery.

However, an internal investigation has failed to determine why the cakes arrived in various stages of collapse.

Only about 1% of Japan's population are Christians, but many in the country celebrate Christmas by exchanging gifts and sharing festive meals with loved ones.

The colours red and white, as in a strawberry cake, represent celebration. Aside from cakes, the Japanese also serve KFC fried chicken on Christmas Eve.

Takashimaya's strawberry shortcake has layers of chiffon and fresh strawberries, covered in white icing that is carefully piped to resemble the frilled hem of a dress. The cakes cost 5,400 yen ($38; £29) each.

But many of the cakes were sent to customers in a less than picture-perfect state.

Photos shared on social media showed sliced strawberries sliding off melted icing and messed-up chiffon layers.

One user on X, formerly Twitter, said the cake arrived in a collapsed state, which they then tried to camouflage with fruits and chocolate sprinkles. The post has so far gained 16.1 million views.

Referring to the redecorated cake, one X user said: ""It is the foundation of free creation.""""The idea of ​​decorating it is wonderful. You have the best wit to shake it off and enjoy it,"" another user said.

Incidents similar to the one in Karnataka have made headlines in recent years

Earlier this month, a woman was stripped and paraded naked in India, sparking outrage. It's a depressingly familiar headline, but legal experts and gender rights activists say the law is still not equipped to deal with such heinous crimes against women.

Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing.

It was sometime after 1am on 11 December when more than a dozen people barged into Sasikala's [not her real name] house.

The 42-year-old was dragged out, stripped and paraded naked around the village, tied to an electricity pole and beaten for hours.

A resident of Hosa Vantamuri village in Belagavi district in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, she was being punished because her 24-year-old son had eloped with his 18-year-old girlfriend.

The young woman had been betrothed by her family to another man and was to get married the next day. Her furious family wanted to know where the couple were.

The police reached the village around 4am after they received a tip-off and rescued Sasikala and took her to hospital. She's reported to be suffering from severe trauma. Her husband later told a visiting state minister that ""my wife and I didn't even know about the relationship"".

More than a dozen people have been arrested and a local police officer has been suspended for ""dereliction of duty"".

The incident made national headlines and authorities took notice. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah called it an ""inhuman act"" and promised justice to her.

The government also gave her some agricultural land and money, although authorities have acknowledged there could be no compensation for the humiliation she endured.

Karnataka high court Chief Justice Prasanna Varale and Justice MGS Kamal, who summoned the police and initiated a hearing on their own, said they were ""shocked"" that such an incident could take place in modern India.

But the incident in Belagavi is not really rare and several similar incidents have made headlines in India in recent years.

Protests in Delhi after two Kuki tribal women were stripped and paraded naked in Manipur in July 2023

One such story that sparked global outrage came from the north-eastern state of Manipur in July. A viral video showed two women being dragged and groped by a mob of men before one of them was allegedly gang-raped.

The horrific attack had a political angle - Manipur was gripped by violent ethnic clashes involving the Kuki and Meitei communities.

But reports from other states show such incidents are often rooted in caste or familial conflicts, with women's bodies routinely becoming the battleground.

In August, a 20-year-old pregnant woman was paraded naked in Rajasthan by her husband and in-laws after she reportedly left him for another man. A 23-year-old tribal woman in Gujarat was punished in a similar manner for eloping with another man in July 2021.

In May 2015, five Dalit women were paraded naked and caned by members of a higher caste in Uttar Pradesh after one of their girls eloped with a Dalit boy. In 2014, a 45-year-old woman in Rajasthan was paraded naked on a donkey after being accused of killing her nephew.

These are just some cases that made headlines, but there's a general lack of data on such incidents. Some cases get politicised, with opposition parties raising them to embarrass a state government. But activists say women often do not report these crimes because of fear of insensitive questioning by the police and in courts.

""Cases involving assault of women are always under-reported because of shame. Families don't come forward because it's a matter of honour and the system does not support the survivors or give them a safe space to report these crimes,"" says lawyer and rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.

In the National Crime Records Bureau database, disrobing is recorded under a broad description called ""assault with intent to outrage [a woman's] modesty"", which clubs the crime with cases of street harassment, sexual gestures, voyeurism and stalking. Last year, 83,344 such cases were recorded with 85,300 affected women.

Such cases are dealt with under article 354 of the Indian Penal Code and are punishable by a mere three to seven years in jail - which, Ms Chauhan says, is ""grossly inadequate"".

""It's a mockery of justice. Law works only when it deters. Right now this law is not a deterrent and that undermines women. It needs to be amended to enhance the punishment,"" she says.

Activists say cases involving sexual assault of women are always under-reported because of shame

In the Karnataka high court, the justices also noted that the assault in Belagavi was watched by ""a crowd of 50-60 villagers"", adding that ""only one man tried to intervene and he was also beaten up"".

Highlighting the need for ""collective responsibility"" to stop such atrocities, the judges cited a case from the 1830s - when India was governed by the British - pointing out that an entire village was made to pay for a crime.

""All village people should be made responsible... Somebody could have tried to stop that,"" they said.

Chief Justice Varale also invoked Draupadi from the epic Mahabharat, who's saved by Hindu god Krishna when she's being disrobed, to advise women ""to pick up arms as no god will come to protect you"".

That advice, Ms Chauhan believes, is not practical.

""We are not Draupadis and there are no weapons to be picked up. Also, the onus cannot be on women. The law has to talk to the wrongdoer, but it's still telling women that they have to find a way to stay safe,"" she says.

""The message we need to get across is stop fighting your ethnic, caste and family battles on our bodies, they are not your battlefield,"" she adds.

Maumil Mehraj, a research analyst who works with young people on gender equity, says the reason a woman's body is treated as a battlefield is because it's connected to her - and by extension her family, caste and community's - honour.

""It's always why women disproportionately have to bear the brunt during conflicts,"" she says.

Such incidents, she says, also have an element of voyeurism because they are seen, photographed and filmed.

In Belagavi, she says, one of those arrested is a minor, indicating that such crimes have been normalised to such an extent that even the next generation has grown up with entrenched gender ideas.

""So will a law be enough to deal with such cases? I think the only solution is bringing up better boys. It's necessary to teach them that connecting a woman's body to her honour is problematic,"" she says.

""It's a Herculean task, but has to start early. Otherwise this vicious violence against women will continue.""

By Lucy Wallis BBC News

BBC Studios

Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have been amusing us for over 40 years

""We never talked about being feminists, we just were,"" says Dawn French.

With their satirical and goofy routines - farcical and ludicrous - she and partner Jennifer Saunders helped transform the comedy landscape for women in the UK.

""Doing our job was being a feminist. That was the point of it really,"" says French in a new BBC documentary about their partnership.

French also discusses how a sketch with singer Anastacia left French feeling ""humiliated"" by her appearance, and led her and Saunders to end their hit BBC TV show.

When they first started out in the late 1970s, the comedy scene was a world away from today. For a start, it was predominantly male. Old-school stand-up comedians such as Bernard Manning, whose routines would now be considered controversial, were mainstream.

The comedy circuit was very male when the pair began performing together

""When I was growing up, the women [on screen] were either bikini-clad babes, or not very attractive mother-in-laws, and were the butt of jokes, rather than telling the joke,"" says actor and director, Kathy Burke, who appeared with French and Saunders on their sketch show.

The duo's agent of more than 40 years, Maureen Vincent, says many of the TV executives who made decisions about what programmes and performers appeared on our TV screens thought women weren't funny ""and were actually heard to say so"".

""Most of the comedic women were playing supporting roles to men in sitcoms.""

But, as the 1980s edged into view, French and Saunders - plus other women such as Pamela Stephenson and Victoria Wood - began to change establishment thinking. They showed that women could stand alone, or as a double act, and be funny and popular.

'I think she found me quite annoying'

French and Saunders had both wanted to be drama teachers when they met at the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1978.

""I remember thinking she looked quite old-fashioned in a funny way and quite grown-up because she arrived and she was ready,"" says Saunders.

""I arrived [at] the other end of the scale, completely unformed and unready.""

Jennifer Saunders

In the late 1970s, French and Saunders would dress up as punks and try to scare people

French's first impression of Saunders was that she was beautiful, elegant and posher than she was.

""I think she found me quite annoying,"" she says. ""I talked a lot. I thought she was wondrous but I didn't think we ever were going to be chums.""

Sharing a flat together, however, made them realise they had the same sense of humour and same boredom threshold, so they invented fun and pranks, says Saunders.

""We'd dress up as punks and go on the tube and see if we could frighten anybody and we'd shout things to people on the street.""

French and Saunders in their 2002 parody of The Lord of the Rings

The pair began to perform sketches at the actors' cabaret at drama school. Sketches like the Menopazzi Sisters - an acrobatic act that wasn't that acrobatic. The duo wore red swimming caps and leotards with nipple tassels on their back, because they'd put their costumes on the wrong way round.

But it was in 1980, at a comedy show in a strip club in London's Soho, that French and Saunders first began to break down stereotypes.

'Girls on Top'

They joined The Comic Strip, a group of comedians described as ""alternative"" at the time - the likes of Alexei Sayle, Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson.

""I think they were embarrassed that they didn't have any women,"" says French.

""They were trawling for them, so they couldn't believe their luck when a couple of big-bosomed girls walked in.""

""Most women liked to preserve their vanity, and they had none of it,"" says Adrian Edmondson - Jennifer Saunders' husband

Not many women at that time were doing this ""British, taking the piss out of themselves, being the idiots"" style of comedy, says Edmondson, who is married to Saunders.

""Most women liked to preserve their vanity, and they had none of it,"" he says. ""That was the shock.""

But French thought the two of them were in the wrong place at first. The satirical Comic Strip had begun to attract a lot of attention for being political, she says, whereas they were just coming up with whatever funny characters they could think of.

""But being there at that time, being women in an equal role to the guys, was political in itself,"" she adds.

By 1982, the Comic Strip had made the transition to television and French and Saunders featured on the launch night of Channel 4. They would go on to co-write and star in the ITV sitcom Girls on Top, with Ruby Wax and Tracey Ullman in 1985, and were given their own sketch show on BBC Two in 1987.

Girls on Top was billed as the female version of the BBC's anarchic house-sharing student comedy The Young Ones - which featured Edmondson, Mayall, Planer and Sayle. But the women encountered push-back over certain words in their scripts. ""Menstruation"" had not been heard much on primetime TV up to that point.

""We weren't being shocking, that's just the way we speak,"" says Ruby Wax. ""We weren't trying to break any walls down, that's just who we were.""

'My shape is who I am'

On their BBC sketch shows, French and Saunders became famous for their Hollywood parodies. Films such as Kill Bill, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Titanic, and Thelma and Louise all received the French and Saunders spoof treatment.

But it was in their ""white room"" sketches, set in a white living room where the duo supposedly lived together, that played around with people's preconceptions of the couple's appearance, says comedian and presenter Sue Perkins.

They were deconstructing the idea that, as ""the blonde one"", people would think Saunders was ""stern"" or, as the ""slightly larger one"", people would think French was ""jolly"" all the time, she says.

As women, they were being judged every second on the way they looked, says Perkins. ""So the white room, for me, was a way of unpicking that.""

French - who has been criticised for her size - says she has never disliked her body.

Her father - who struggled with depression and took his life when she was 19 - instilled confidence in her at a young age, she says, reminding her that she should always value herself.

""My dad noticed that if you are a little fat girl, you could trip into a great big crack of low self-esteem,"" she says. ""I think he just knew instinctively that he needed to make sure that I had armour.

""We live in a world where people would love you to have some shame about whatever shape you are - and I just have never understood why I should.

""It's who I am, and I'm going to inhabit it right to the very ends of my fingers, because it's what I've got to work with.""

'Humiliated' by Anastacia sketch

Watch: Dawn French tells Jennifer Saunders why she quit their sketch show

But there were moments when her confidence faltered, she explains.

The duo decided to retire their TV show in 2008 after performing a sketch with the singer Anastacia - in which French had dressed in a similar outfit to the US star. French says she was left feeling ""humiliated"".

""I looked in the mirror and I thought: 'Yes, this isn't it, this isn't what Anastacia looks like.' But instead of finding it funny, I just thought: 'Oh I don't like it.'

""It just felt like I wasn't in control of the comedy. The joke was on me. I hadn't controlled it in any way.""

'Cosy but not safe'

Not only have Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders been an inspiration to future generations of female comedians - they have also championed other funny women.

French says just because their sketch show stopped, it didn't mean their comedy relationship or love for each other would change

In the 1990s, as they waited to go on stage at their second Edinburgh Festival, comedy double act Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc each received a bouquet of flowers with a card.

The cards both read:

Dear Mel/Dear Sue, very good luck with the Edinburgh show

Lots and lots of love, Dawn and Jennifer

PS I've always thought you were funnier than the other one

Perkins and Giedroyc would go on to become contributing writers on the French and Saunders sketch show.

In both their joint work and in their solo projects - the likes of sitcoms The Vicar of Dibley and Absolutely Fabulous - French and Saunders have both explored what they know best, explains French, the ""empowering nature of female friendship"". It's embodied in their own relationship.

From the days when they used to dress up as punks, to the present, they have retained their fighting spirit against the establishment.

They ""never lost that layer of punk,"" says Kathy Burke. ""They've been cosy, but not safe.

By Monica Miller BBC News, Singapore

Apple says it will appeal US import ban on its latest smart watch models.

Apple says it will appeal after sales of its newest smart watches were halted in the US over a patent row.

It comes after the White House declined to overturn a ban on sales and imports of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches which came into effect this week.

The US International Trade Commission took the action to protect device maker Masimo, which accuses Apple of poaching its staff and technology.

Apple said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the ruling.

Earlier this month, Apple ""pre-emptively"" removed the devices from its US site and from stores in the country. Sales elsewhere have not been affected.

The US International Trade Commission (USITC) order, issued in October, was subject to a 60-day review by the president, who has the power to veto the decision. That review period ended on Christmas Day.

The office of the United States Trade Representative Ambassador, Katherine Tai, said on Tuesday that it had decided not to reverse the USITC's decision after ""careful consultations"".

Apple had asked for a stay on the ban until Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could consider whether the redesigned versions of its watches, which do not include the disputed technology, violated Masimo's patents.

CBP is due to make its decision on 12 January, according to an Apple spokesperson.

The USITC found in October that Apple infringed two patents owned by medical device maker Masimo Corporation.

The California-based company had accused Apple of poaching key staff and taking other steps to steal technology it developed to measure oxygen levels in the blood.

Most versions of Apple's smart watches have included the disputed blood oxygen feature since 2020. Its lower cost SE model do not. Previously sold watches will also not be affected by the ban.

Apple also says it has filed an emergency request to the US Court of Appeals to lift the ban.

""We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible,"" the tech giant said in a statement on Tuesday.

By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney

Mikkel Vang

Renowned Australian chef Bill Granger - the ""godfather"" of avocado toast - has died.

A self-taught cook from Melbourne, Granger became a celebrated global restaurateur and food writer.

He passed away in a London hospital on Christmas Day, aged 54, his wife and three daughters by his side.

""He will be remembered as the 'King of Breakfast', for making unpretentious food into something special filled with sunshine,"" they said on Instagram.

""He will be deeply missed by all.""

His cause of death has not been made public by his family.

Over his 30-year career, Granger published 14 cookbooks, made multiple television cooking shows, opened more than a dozen restaurants around the world, and won legions of fans - many his own peers.

Celebrities including Australian actor Hugh Jackman, former Masterchef Australia judge Matt Preston and culinary legend Jamie Oliver were among those who paid tribute to the star as a kind, lively and charming man.

""He was the loveliest man, and the joy he gave us - whether through his food, his books, the spaces he made for us or in person - came from the kindness and generosity and sheer, shining exuberance of his very self,"" food author and TV chef Nigella Lawson wrote on Instagram.

""So devastated for his family. It's too cruel.""

Granger began his career in 1993, after he dropped out of art school to open his first restaurant in Sydney when he was just 23 years old.

Bills - a sunny corner cafe - became renowned for simple dishes like avocado toast, ricotta pancakes with honeycomb butter, and top-quality coffee.

Its popularity exploded, and from there he opened more cafes in Japan, Korea and London with offshoot chain Granger & Co.

Australian chef Darren Robertson said Granger had ""changed the entire breakfast game"", while Masterchef Australia alumnus Adam Liaw described him as ""arguably [the] most influential pioneer of modern Australian food"".

""His 'sunny'... codification of Australian cafe culture at Bills is the model on which every Australian cafe around the world is now built. Great guy, too,"" Liaw wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Such was his impact that in January, Granger was recognised with the Medal of the Order of Australia - one of the country's top honours - for his contribution to tourism and hospitality.

Speaking to the BBC in 2019, the chef reflected on the humble foundations of his breakfast empire.

""I've done all these extraordinary things, just from liking to cook pancakes and scrambled eggs, which is pretty amazing.""

Granger is one of the people credited with the popularity of avocado and toast.

He recommended using an avocado that had been left to ripen for two to three days, before scooping it out its skin with a tablespoon in one smooth movement. It should then be chopped into egg-shaped chunks, he said.

""Just crush it on the sourdough toast yourself, and always serve with citrus - lemon or lime - and good sea salt, and coriander for freshness,"" he told the Australian Financial Review.

Granger is survived by his wife and business partner, Natalie Elliott, and his three daughters, Edie, Inès and Bunny.","'Godfather' of avocado toast Bill Granger dies, aged 54By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, SydneyMikkel VangRenowned Australian chef Bill Granger - the ""godfather"" of avocado toast - has died.

Israel's military chief said the war with Hamas would last ""many more months""

Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months.

The UN has expressed grave concern after Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens of people in Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi camps in recent days.

Heavy fighting is also continuing to the south, in the city of Khan Younis.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian president has described what is happening in Gaza as ""beyond a war of annihilation"".

The Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 195 people have been killed across the territory over the past 24 hours.

More than 21,100 have been killed - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the ministry.

The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

Palestinian media cited local officials and witnesses as saying dozens of civilians were killed as Israel kept up its strikes across Gaza overnight.

Heavy bombardment was reported in the Middle Area, particularly in Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat camps.

In Nuseirat, Israeli warplanes targeted the homes of the Nasser and Hazouqi families, killing a number of people and wounding dozens more, according to the official Wafa news agency.

Hamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported that five had been killed in a strike on a girls school in Maghazi.

Residents meanwhile told Reuters news agency that there was heavy fighting east and north of Bureij district and in the nearby village of Juhr al-Deek.

Israel has ordered the evacuation of areas of central Gaza where the UN says more than 150,000 people are living

There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday evening that its forces had ""expanded the combat to the area known as the Central Camps"".

The IDF also reiterated on Tuesday its order for residents to leave more than a dozen central areas running from the Gaza-Israel perimeter to the coast, including Bureij and Nuseirat camps.

According to the UN, the affected areas were home to nearly 90,000 people before the war. They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north.

The residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people.

The UN human rights office said on Tuesday that it was gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday.

It also warned of a ""deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation"", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced.

A Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were ""having to live with... constant loss, constant fear"".

""Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes,"" she said. ""My four-year-old nephew... had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago.""

The bombardment of the north and south of Gaza also continued on Wednesday.

In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a house where displaced people were staying near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis.

The Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital, said dozens were killed or wounded and posted a graphic video that showed paramedics and bystanders retrieving several bodies on a street.

The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but a spokesperson did appear to confirm reports from Tuesday that Israel had handed over the bodies of 80 Palestinians after checking there were no hostages among them.

""During the war, bodies have been transported to Israel for an identification procedure as part of our effort to locate the hostages and the missing persons,"" the spokesperson said.

It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. A number of bodies have also been recovered and Israeli officials have confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas.

Watch: Drone shots show Palestinians buried in mass grave

Israel's been under pressure from its closest ally, the US, to lower the intensity of its military operations in Gaza and reduce the number of civilian deaths, but there is no sign of that happening yet.

The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in ""a complex area"" and would therefore ""continue for many more months"".

""There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined,"" he added.

""We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months.""

He was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq.

In his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history.

""What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this,"" he told Egypt's ON TV.

Mr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time.

On Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry.","Israel expanding ground offensive into central Gaza refugee campsBy David Gritten BBC NewsReutersIsrael's military chief said the war with Hamas would last ""many more months""Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months.
The UN has expressed grave concern after Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens of people in Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi camps in recent days.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian president has described what is happening in Gaza as ""beyond a war of annihilation"".
More than 21,100 have been killed - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the ministry.
Palestinian media cited local officials and witnesses as saying dozens of civilians were killed as Israel kept up its strikes across Gaza overnight."

From new artificial islands to the environmental devastation caused by the breach of Ukraine's Kakhovka Dam – this is how humanity has changed the face of our planet throughout the past year.

There are few places on the Earth where humans have not left a mark of some kind. An estimated 95% of our planet's landmass – not including Antarctica, even though humanity has left its imprint there, too – now show some signs of human activity. About 16% of that land has been heavily modified, according to one recent analysis.

Urban development, large-scale engineering works and mining projects are reshaping entire landscapes, while deforestation and agriculture are altering entire ecosystems. Pollution produced by humans can be found in almost every corner of our planet.

Earth's reshaping continued apace during 2023 – for better and for worse. Here are some of the most dramatic ways our species has changed the planet's surface this year.

Just two years ago, Pearson Reef in the South China Sea was little more than a tiny atoll among more than 100 reefs and specks of sand-covered coral – when viewed from space – that make up the Spratly Islands (see the image below to see how it looked in 2021). But Vietnam, which has occupied the island since the late 1970s, embarked on a major enlargement project towards the end of 2021. By dredging and landfilling, the country has added 163 acres (66ha) of land to the island, and created a sheltered harbour in the middle of the reef, which can be seen in this satellite image above taken in August 2023.

The growth in electric vehicles and other battery-powered devices, demand for lithium has soared in recent years. But warnings of an impending shortage of this critical metal in years to come has prompted a scrabble to open new mines to extract it. Among those to begin operations in 2023 was the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina's Jujuy Province. The bright-green evaporation ponds are clearly visible in this satellite image from Maxar Technologies. The lithium is extracted from the salt of the South American salars – salt flats – by turning it into a brine that is then evaporated to concentrate the lithium.

In the Shan Mountains of eastern Myanmar, shifting agricultural practices have transformed the surface of Inle Lake. Recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site, the lake is famous for floating gardens created by the villagers who live along its shores, as well as fishermen who row with their legs. But a growth in the large scale aquaculture of tomatoes has dramatically decreased the surface area of the lake.

High in the Andes mountains, at an altitude of around 4,400m (14,000ft) – a huge hole has been opening up in the ground. This is the Quebrada Blanca open pit copper mine, which expanded its operations in 2023. The companies that run the mine hope to produce 300,000 tonnes of copper a year from it.

Water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir in Ukraine have fallen drastically after its dam was destroyed, causing widespread ecological damage (Credit: Getty Images)

On 6 June 2023, a series of early morning blasts cracked open the Kakhovka Dam, causing water to surge into the Dnipro River and leading to severe flooding downstream in the days that followed. Ukraine's military accused Russia of deliberately blowing up the dam, while Russia blamed the Ukrainians. Without the dam to hold back the water, the landscape both above and below the dam was transformed over the months that followed. A network of canals that were fed by the reservoir ran dry during the summer and leaving those working in the surrounding farmland struggling to irrigate their crops.

Before the explosions, the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir were the highest they had been in a number of years, but after the dam was breached, it almost dried up. An assessment by the UN Environment Programme described the damage as a ""far-reaching environmental disaster"" that would stretch far beyond Ukraine's borders. The reservoir itself had been a fully functioning ecosystem that was decimated, while flooding downstream caused considerable damage to natural habitats and plant communities. The organisation warned that the damage caused by the breach of the dam was likely to be ""irreversible"".

In September 2023, Ethiopia announced it had successfully filled its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile. But the news angered nations downstream, with Egypt accusing Ethiopia of threatening its supply of water. The dam, which Ethiopia wants to use to produce electricity, has been a hugely controversial issue, as it could also give the country's government control over its neighbours' water supply.

Stretching like an enormous scar across the desert are the foundations of a portion of The Line – a 170km (105 miles)-long city being constructed in Neom, a huge territory on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Construction work on the project – which Saudi Arabia has been keen to promote as a high-tech eco-city that will be the ""blueprint for tomorrow"" – can be seen at one end of a road stretching between Gayal and Ras Al Sheikh Al Hamid. Some critics have also ⁠questioned the planned city's green credentials.

By Alex Christian Features correspondent

Workers faced both existential crises and found competitive advantages in AI this year (Credit: Alamy)

Heralded and decried in equal measure, artificial intelligence has already changed how we work now, and how we will in the future.

It has been just more than a year since OpenAI launched its chatbot, ChatGPT, yet the technology is already top of mind for most workers. In many cases, it's become a part of their daily routines.

AI has gone from feeling like an abstract idea to a familiar tool that can streamline workflows and generate new ideas. But not everyone has welcomed the technology, and instead see it as a threat to their very careers. It's a push-and-pull that's defined this year.

The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it. They also give us a peek into how AI might shape 2024, as the technology continues to evolve at lightning pace.

Workers are already depending on AI

Many employees have grown accustomed to using AI in their daily jobs for time-saving administrative tasks, particularly rudimentary writing and basic ideation. This is especially the case in knowledge-work positions, where AI shows potential to free up workers to do creative, more sophisticated tasks. (Some workers are even using the technology to write resumes and cover letters to get those jobs in the first place.)

But as more workers utilise AI, some employers are responding by curbing the technology's use in the workplace. This has included tacitly suppressing or outright banning access to tools like ChatGPT, with organisations worried about potential misuse or data leaks, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US.

Yet some employees who've come to heavily rely on the tools, whether for increased productivity or to get a leg up on colleagues, have had to backchannel to retain access. Social-media communities have even offered tips on how to secretly access the technology at work.

AI is evolving to target some office jobs

Many people assumed AI would most likely replace humans in roles that are easily automated: think the customer service chatbots and grocery-delivering robots already busy at work.

But as it has evolved in the past year, it's clear that it could impact more complex knowledge work roles once considered ""safe"". Some creative jobs are already being threatened. For example, text-to-image generative AI programs like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create dazzling illustrations and photorealistic renders in moments – work that's typically reserved for highly skilled commercial art teams.

Data shows there's validity to workers' worries. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans – equating to 300 million jobs lost across Europe and the US.

""This isn't somebody else's problem now. It's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at US economic think tank organisation the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC. ""We don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""

But some jobs won't be replaced – yet

For all the fear, however, there are many roles and tasks that AI won't be capable of performing in the near future. That's particularly the case with jobs that demand soft skills, such as emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking.

Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, believes workers whose job it is to come up with new business strategies may be relatively safe from automation. He also predicts roles that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships – for example, nurses and business consultants – are hard for machines to replace. These are jobs, he says, that require ""a very deep understanding of people. I think it'll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships"".

Additionally, trade jobs that far pre-date digital work environments – such as electricians, plumbers and welders – are among the ""hardest of anything to automate"", says Ford. These jobs are less reliant on language-based tasks and typically require greater problem-solving ability, mobility and dexterity in unpredictable environments that machines cannot currently mimic.

We're also going to work with AI

As AI becomes more ubiquitous, some experts believe the technology is actually more likely to augment – rather than replace – human talent. Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, cites medical diagnoses as an example. While a robot may be able to detect cancer, for instance, most patients would prefer a qualified medical professional to break the news.

Workers are already utilising ChatGPT as a personal assistant, using it to draft emails, plan itineraries and project costs and timelines. More broadly, professionals are already using AI to help eliminate bias in decision making – some large corporations are already employing data-driven recruitment to test candidates' qualities, with behavioural insights matching them with the right vacancy.

And while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones; for example, data engineers, governance specialists and a host of ""training"" roles.

Alongside much fear and uncertainty, there's optimism

AI may be the technology of the day, but it's far from the first to disrupt the workforce. Technology has advanced exponentially over the decades, from the rise of automation in mechanics, to office computers and wireless internet.

""Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, it has the potential to automate or streamline work processes,"" says Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at PwC, based in Austin, US. ""However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements.""","The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it.

Among all the highs and lows of the year in the arts, here are the people, works and incidents that really got everyone talking.

Arts and culture may be a sanctum from the trials of daily life for many, but that is not to say they can't cause as much debate and consternation as they can provide comfort and joy. So here are 11 moments from within the cultural sphere that really created a commotion this year:

1. Prince Harry releases a bombshell book

He may have quit the British Royal Family and moved to California with his wife Meghan and their children, but the Duke of Sussex proved he was far from leaving the past behind him, when in January he released his autobiography Spare, and pulled no punches. Bearing the Prince's distinct tone of voice and turn of phrase, the book – though ghost-written by JR Moehringer – was as candid as they come, generating acres of headlines with its more sensational stories, revelations and claims. From detailing his alleged fisticuffs with the Prince of Wales to a case of frostbite on his genitalia during Prince William and Catherine's wedding, there was seemingly no filter applied. Perhaps as a result, according to Guinness World Records, Spare became ""the fastest selling non-fiction book of all time"" on the date of its release. But while Prince Harry will have been celebrating his literary success, his father King Charles III was reported to be ""hurt and dismayed"" by the publication. And the year was literally book-ended by scandalous royal tomes, when in December royal reporter Omid Scobie released his own book, Endgame. It again detailed alleged royal tensions, and caused particular controversy when a Dutch edition of the book was erroneously published naming King Charles and Catherine as the royals who allegedly discussed the potential skin colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's first child.

2. Kylie Jenner sparks debate by wearing a (fake) lion head

Coming from a family, the Kardashian-Jenners, who seem to live by Oscar Wilde's adage: ""The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about"", Kylie Jenner certainly offered a roar for attention at January's Paris Fashion Week with her divisive outfit. The make-up mogul turned up in a black Schiaparelli dress with such an ultra-realistic lion head attached to the shoulder that some wondered if it was actual taxidermy of the jungle creature. While the brand were quick to point out it was fake on Instagram – stating in all caps ""NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED IN MAKING THIS LOOK"" – many were still offended by it. One commenter below the Schiaparelli post said, in reference to the wider trend for realistic animal parts in fashion: ""We have to stop showing animals as luxury 'products'. They may be made from foam but these are endangered species that have historically been killed for their pelts to be turned into garments."" Unexpectedly, however, the anti-animal cruelty charity Peta praised Jenner for her sartorial choice, explaining: ""These fabulously innovative three-dimensional animal heads show that where there's a will, there's a way. We encourage everyone to stick with 100% cruelty-free designs that showcase human ingenuity and prevent animal suffering.""

3. A German ballet director smears a critic with faeces

Ballet: a powerful cultural medium that uses the intricate mastery of the human body to tell a story through dance. Or, a study in how actions can tell us more than words. That's presumably the belief of choreographer Marco Goecke, the now ex-director of Hanover State Ballet, who in February chose to make his feelings known about a bad review by smearing dog faeces in a critic's face. The grotesque attack happened in the interval of his latest show, when, after confronting Wiebke Hüster, the dance critic of German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, about her negative reaction to his previous work, he pulled out a bag of the offending matter and rubbed it in her face. ""When I felt what he had done, I screamed,"" Hüster was reported as saying afterwards. Hüster's crime? She had said of his previous production, In the Dutch Mountain, that ""one alternates between a state of feeling insane and being killed by boredom"". It was later announced that Goeke would be leaving the HSO ""by mutual agreement"", and Hüster had the final word when she told the New York Times: ""I will never attend any Goecke show again,"" adding in a truly cutting aside: ""He is not that relevant.""

4. Gwyneth Paltrow's ski-crash case

It was the most talked-about celebrity appearance of the year – the two weeks in March when Gwyneth Paltrow turned up in a Utah courtroom to mount her defence after being sued by retired optometrist Terry Sanderson for liability in a 2016 ski-crash between, only to countersue him for the same incident. The court proceedings produced many memorable moments. But it was the pithy little asides from Paltrow in the witness stand that really captured the public's attention. When asked how she had suffered in the crash, she quipped: ""Well, we lost half a day of skiing,"" and the internet erupted. When the jury eventually found Sanderson entirely at fault – and awarded Paltrow damages of $1, as she requested – Paltrow, like a true movie nemesis, approached Sanderson and whispered ""I wish you well"", before sweeping out of the courtroom.

5. Hit country song Try That In a Small Town divides opinion in the US

Country singers are known for telling it how it is, and on this year's most debated chart hit, Try That In A Small Town, Nashville musician Jason Aldean certainly didn't hold back about his opinion of life in big cities compared to rural towns. In the lyrics, Aldean lamented the changing state of the world, and, some alleged, threatened violence against those who would ""try that in a small town… see how far ya make it down the road"". However, the real outcry was over the video, which was accused of being racist for featuring clips of police violence against Black Lives Matters protestors until they were removed. Adding further fuel to the fire was the video's filming location, which was revealed to be a courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, where the lynching of Henry Choate occurred in 1927. Aldean has consistently and vigorously rejected such accusations but four days after the video's release, Country Music Television pulled it from their channel. However the song began to rack up millions of plays and entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number two, before rising to the top spot. Similarly, towards the end of the summer, another song that was perceived as speaking for disillusioned white working-class people across rural America, Oliver Anthony’s Rich Men North Of Richmond, also struck a chord, and went viral, getting five million views in just three days. Fox News played Rich Men North of Richmond at the first Republican presidential TV debate in August, but, in a YouTube statement, Anthony claimed he is non-partisan and that the song had been ""weaponised"" in the culture wars: ""I see the right trying to characterise me as one of their own. And I see the left trying to discredit me, I guess in retaliation.""

6. HBO's The Idol becomes 2023's biggest TV turkey

A collaboration between Sam Levinson, the creator of feted teen show Euphoria, and pop superstar Abel ""The Weeknd"" Tesfaye, The Idol was one of the most hyped shows of recent times, even if advance reports alleged a troubled shoot. However, when it finally hit screens in June, following a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, it was universally eviscerated. Described by The Daily Telegraph as ""the worst show of the year"", The Guardian went one further to dub it ""one of the worst TV shows ever made"". Both opinions had merit: Levinson and Tesfaye created a series that had seemingly promised to be a searing take on the dark and exploitative nature of the music industry, but instead turned out to be a degrading, misogynistic and highly problematic tale of a young popstar (played by Lily-Rose Depp), who falls into an S&M relationship with a cult leader. The dialogue was terrible and the plotlines evaporated into thin air, nor did Tesfaye's performance as the manipulative Svengali help matters; as for the presumably hastily pulled together female empowerment ""twist"" ending, it was both misjudged and illogical. Needless to say, HBO cancelled it after just one season. Still, at least it produced what GQ claimed was possibly ""the song of the summer"".

7. Sound of Freedom becomes a surprise summer box-office hit

With various blockbusters flopping this summer, one lower-budgeted film came out of nowhere to be the unlikely success story of the season. Inspired by the experiences of Tim Ballard, a former US government agent turned anti human trafficking activist, independent drama Sound Of Freedom has now earned almost $250 million at the international box office. Starring Jim Caviezel as Ballard, it drew attention to a horrific issue, but divided opinion, and while receiving considerable support from prominent conservatives, was accused of being ""QAnon adjacent"" by some more left-wing publications – a reference to the infamous conspiracy theory movement. This was not helped by star Caviezel, who had appeared at a QAnon-affiliated conference in Oklahoma in 2021 to talk about the film, where he repeated the group's false claims that a global cabal of satanic-worshipping elites harvest ""adrenochrome"" from children, a chemical which is supposedly found in children's adrenal glands and used as an elixir of youth. In response to such criticism, the film's writer and director Alejandro Monteverde told Variety that he ""was like really sick. I was like, 'This is all wrong. That's not true'. It was heartbreaking when I saw all this polemic and all this controversy going on."" No matter the bad publicity however: a sequel based in Haiti is being planned.

8. Matty Healy gets The 1975 banned from Malaysia for kissing his male bandmate on-stage

Fresh from a short-lived rebound relationship with the newly-single Taylor Swift – which caused ire among some of her disapproving fans – Matty Healy, the frontman of UK band The 1975, was propelled into more headlines in July, after causing outrage at a Malaysian festival. Performing at Good Vibes Festival in Kuala Lumpur, Healy told the crowd that the band's decision to appear in the country in which homosexuality is illegal, and punishable by up to 20 years in jail, had been a ""mistake "". He then kissed the bass player Ross MacDonald, before the band ended their set, claiming officials ordered them off stage. The entire festival was subsequently cancelled because of a directive from Malaysia's Ministry of Communications and Digital, leading to an outcry from both the country’s LGBT+ community and music fans, many of whom did not look on Healy's actions favourably. One person on TikTok commented: ""I hate this white saviour complex of people coming to regions like Southeast Asia – with no prior research whatsoever to what the culture is, or the repercussions of doing acts like this – and ruining it not for them but for the people who actually live here.""

9. The British Museum announces that around 2,000 objects are ""missing""

As the debate rolls on as to whether The British Museum should return artefacts that originated from other countries such as the Parthenon Marbles or the Rosetta Stone, the 250-year-old London cultural institution faced further difficulties in August when it was announced that around 2,000 items from its collection had gone AWOL, presumed stolen. It was an academic-turned-antiques dealer, Ittai Gradel, who first noticed an item from the museum for sale on Ebay in 2021, and alerted the institution. But after an investigation that did not uncover any problems, Gradel alleges he was told by the museum's then-director Hartwig Fischer that ""all objects were accounted for"". When the true extent of the theft was revealed – thousands of items taken over a period of years from the collection's storeroom – Fischer apologised, not only for not responding as comprehensively as he should but for making ""misjudged"" comments about Gradel himself, and resigned. One staff member suspected of being involved in the theft was sacked, but the vast majority of the stolen items are still unaccounted for. One arts professional told the Evening Standard that there was a bigger impact from this scandal: ""It is like the last vestiges of British colonialism, this arrogance, and I think that's inevitable now that it will face more restitution claims.""

10. Drew Barrymore crosses the picket line

The WGA and Sag-Aftra writers' and actors' strikes made Hollywood grind to a halt for many months in 2023, as the unions fought for better pay and working conditions. So most writing or filming stopped during this time, and most promotional events and activities were also prohibited. However, amid the unionised solidarity between many actors and creatives, one star who crossed the picket line was Drew Barrymore, who in September made the decision to start filming her chat show The Drew Barrymore Show again, despite the ongoing writers strikes, just without WGA writers. The WGA said it was a ""violation"" of union rules, as the talk show was ""a WGA-covered, struck show"", and a crowd of protestors turned up outside the set, chanting ""shut it down"", Barrymore later backtracked, stopping production after writing in a now-deleted Instagram post: ""I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show's premiere until the strike is over. I have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt and, of course, to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today."" By 9 November, all strikes had ended.

11.A Danish artist is forced to repay museum after submitting blank canvases

Who decrees what is or isn't art? The Danish artist Jens Haaning stoked the contentious discussion once again with what some might consider one of the best examples of performance art in recent memory – although the museum who commissioned it certainly disagreed. Back in 2021, Hanning was given more than 500,000 kroner (£58,000) by The Kunsten Museum in Aalborg to embed into recreations of two previous works of his, comprised of frames encasing piles of banknotes representing the total average annual salary of someone in Denmark and Austria, respectively. However, when he handed in his work this time, all he offered was two blank canvases, in a project he then wittily christened Take the Money and Run, explaining ""The work is that I've taken their money"". The museum asked Haaning for the money back, but he refused to return it, and this year a court finally ordered him to reimburse the institution. But despite the ruling, the museum has been displaying Haaning’s canvases anyway, describing them as showing ""that works of art, despite intentions to the contrary, are part of a capitalist system that values ​​a work based on some arbitrary condition"". The irony of the whole affair was not lost on Haaning, who told TV2 Nord the museum had made ""much, much more"" money than what it invested thanks to the publicity surrounding the affair.

By Richard Gray Features correspondent @chalkmark

The reason your poo sometimes floats is down to the make-up of bacteria inside your guts (Credit: Getty Images)

The mystery of why our number twos sometimes bob to the surface of the toilet water while others sink without trace has been solved – and it could be a window into the health of the bacteria living in our guts.

Before we dive in, Nagarajan Kannan has a question: ""Are you a floater or a sinker?"" It's a surprisingly intimate thing to ask someone you've only exchanged emails with, but it is exactly this line of thinking that has led to something of a passion project for the director of the Mayo Clinic's stem cell and cancer biology laboratory in Rochester, Minnesota.

Most of his day job is spent studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to breast cancer. But during rare idle moments, Kannan has found himself wrestling with another puzzle – why do faeces sometimes float.

Most of us have probably experienced it at some point: the poo that simply refuses to flush, bobbing around on the surface of the water like an incriminating brown buoyancy aid. At other times, however, our number twos simply sink without trace. A mystery indeed.

The answer to this scatological conundrum, however, offers some surprising insights about what is going on inside our bodies and the health of the microbes that live there, Kannan believes.

It had initially been thought that the reason for the occasional floating unmentionable was something to do with the levels of fat that made their way into it. But in the early 1970s a couple of gastroenterologists at the University of Minnesota with time on their hands decided to put it to the test with a series of experiments. After subjecting the excrement from 39 volunteers – and some of their own solid waste for good measure – to a barrage of tests, the answer they came up with was that it was not fat, but gas.

More precisely the amount of gas found within a stool can vary to such degrees that they can either float to the surface or sink like a brick (along with a fair bit of mid-bowl drifting in-between). If the gas in a floater was compressed out, the researchers discovered, they would sink.

Could our ‘number twos’ be the answer to some of the world’s biggest problems?

The reason for the difference, they concluded, was too much methane production. In other words, excessive flatulence.

And this is where Kannan enters the increasingly whiffy arena. In the intervening years, medical science has revealed the enormous role that our microbiota play in many aspects of our health – from obesity to heart disease. Kannan suspected that changes in the make up of the 100 trillion bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms that call our guts their home may be responsible for whether our faeces is buoyant or not.

""The majority of faecal matter primarily comprises transformed food particles forming a bacterial mass,"" he says.

To put the theory to the test, he and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic studied the droppings of mice raised in sterile conditions. These germ-free rodents have no microbes in their guts. In faecal floatation tests developed by the team, the poop from these mice sank instantly in water, while around 50% of the droppings from mice with gut microbes floated, before eventually drifting downwards. When they took a closer look, the reason became clear.

""Germ-free faeces are packed with sub-microscopic undigested food particles and have a higher faecal density than microbially loaded faeces,"" says Kannan. The team then gave some of the germ-free mice a faecal transplant from the normal mice whose poop had floated – meaning they received their gut bacteria. The formerly germ-free mice then also began to produce droppings that floated.

Even when the mice were given bacteria from human donors, they too floated.

""It seems that once those microbes set up shop, it's a universal ""rise to the top"" situation for mouse poop, regardless of the donor species,"" says Kannan.

He and his colleagues also conducted some broadscale genetic analysis of the bacterial species in the poop from mice that were floaters and found they had high levels of 10 bacterial species known to produce gas. Dominant among them was Bacteroides ovatus, which is known to produce gas through the fermentation of carbohydrates and has been linked to excessive flatulence in human patients.

Although the findings in mice should be treated cautiously – they have yet to be confirmed to bear relevance to human ""floaters"" and ""sinkers"" – Kannan believes the buoyancy of our poop could be an indicator of changes in the different communities of bacteria in our guts.

""I have this inkling that a 'floater' might transiently become a 'sinker' while on antibiotics,"" he says. But he adds he's not seen anyone study this yet. ""Securing funding for faecal floatation isn't a walk in the park, unfortunately.""

""Whether you're at a packed social event or on a deep space journey, you probably don't fancy being seated next to someone with a gut full of these gasogenic microbes and a penchant for frequent flatulence.""

It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.

By Lillian Stone Features correspondent

Many of this year's buzzwords arrived and spread online through platforms including TikTok (Credit: Alamy)

Largely originating on social media, this year's top jargon explains what workers want – and who they've become in a post-pandemic world.

The unprecedented work landscape of 2020 and 2021 gave rise to the now-ubiquitous ""Great Resignation"". The following year, ""quiet quitting"" took over. This year, as the line between social media and work culture dissolved, and workers settled into new hybrid patterns, a host of new jargon took hold to define work in 2023.

'Lazy girl job'

In late May, TikToker Gabrielle Judge extolled the virtues of the ""lazy girl job"": a remote, well-paying, relatively low-stress role. The basic premise – a job that allows for a healthy set of priorities and work-life balance – resonated on a massive scale.

As of December, the hashtag #LazyGirlJob has racked up nearly 40 million views on TikTok. And although the term found itself among the ""girl trends"" of 2023, workers of all stripes have made it clear: the lazy girl job might more accurately be described as simply a good job, for everyone.

'Summer of strikes'

In February, health workers in the UK staged the largest strike in the history of the National Health Service (NHS). Meanwhile, in the US, more than 300,000 US workers across the healthcare, entertainment, auto and hospitality fields walked off their jobs during the first eight months of 2023 alone. As of 31 October, there were 354 strikes in the US, involving roughly 492,000 workers – the largest amount of organized labour activity since 2019.

While not strictly limited to the warm-weather months, this action quickly became known as the ""summer of strikes"", with some tracing the origins of the term to Amazon Union President Chris Smalls's ordination of the ""hot labour summer"" (with credit due to musical artist Meagan Thee Stallion). The actions were overwhelmingly successful, resulting in unprecedented contracts for workers' unions, including the Writers' Guild of America (WGA) and the United Auto Workers (UAW).

'Authentic'

In late November, Merriam-Webster designated ""authentic"" as the official Word of the Year. The US-based reference-book publisher said it beat out contenders including ""deepfake"" and ""dystopian"". The Word of the Year designation isn't strictly focused on workplace terminology; still, the desire for authenticity has very much found its way into our jobs.

Increasingly, workers are expressing their individuality, sharing experiencing with colleagues, normalising issues around mental health and fostering a more intimate – authentic – workplace environment.

'Bare minimum Mondays'

Last year, TikToker Marisa Jo Mayes offered a cure for the ""Sunday Scaries"" – the sinking feeling the day before returning to work after a weekend off. Instead of diving into tasks headfirst, Mayes suggested workers embrace ""bare minimum Mondays"", treating the first day of the week as a gradual re-entry.

The term's popularity blew up this year, with more than three-million TikTok searches as of this writing. While it may have something in common with quiet quitting, the term also reflects a new mood toward work, where the demands for hybrid arrangements and the push for a four-day workweek reflect employees' desire for better work-life balance.

'Coffee badging'

As bosses have won back power throughout 2023, many workers have found themselves returning to their desks, at least a few days a week. Many don't want to be there – an attitude that's given rise to ""coffee badging"". Data from a June survey by video-conferencing company Owl Labs showed around 58% of hybrid workers admit to going into the office, swiping their work badges, grabbing their morning coffees and leaving to work from home for the rest of the day.

Even as return-to-office policies are increasingly winning out, workers have made their preference for flexible work – and free coffee – abundantly clear.

'Hush trips'

Many workers who have been able to stay remote are taking ""hush trips"" to maximise their work-life balance. These secret holidays involve working from a far-flung spot without informing your supervisor or team. Around 44% of Gen Z workers admit to the practice, per an August survey from ResumeBuilder.

The key to a successful hush trip? Adjusting your Zoom background to hide any tell-tale palm trees or pool chairs, say the survey respondents.

'The Big Stay'

According to some economists, The Great Resignation that defined the past three years of workforce mobility is over. Now, the data points to a phenomenon of ""The Big Stay"", in which workers are staying put to avoid an increasingly competitive labour market and fears of economic instability.

Yet workers who stay in jobs that don't suit them are disengaged, less productive and more likely to struggle with their mental and physical health. Experts say that if employers want to stem the quiet quitting among their workers, the onus will be on management to proactively invest in worker satisfaction.

'Personality hire'

Savvy employers might prioritise job candidates with positive, friendly attitudes – but Gen Z workers are taking things a step further, flocking to TikTok to extoll the benefits of being a ""personality hire"".

A loose play on ""diversity hire"" – a generally derogatory term to describe tokenistic hiring of minority workers – social-media users generally define a ""personality hire"" as someone who makes up for their lack of professional qualifications with a certain vivacity. Videos playing on the term show young workers laughing, strolling around the workplace and asking, ""What's for lunch?"" at the top of the workday, knowing their jobs are ""based on vibes"".

Although the term is light spirited, there's some truth within it. In a remote-work environment, an emotionally-intelligent employee can foster communication, which can increase productivity among teams, and contribute to a sense of social connection.

'Rolling recession'

A ""rolling recession"", sometimes called a ""rolling adjustment recession"", occurs when a downturn only impacts certain sectors of the economy at a time.

For example, although tech layoffs dominated the conversation during the first half of the year, other sectors, including the auto and manufacturing industries, have begun feeling the pain. Meanwhile, employment sectors that have traditionally been dominated by women – such as education, nursing and hospitality – continue to bear the brunt of job losses, largely without much fanfare.

While economists and policy makers work stave off job loss, a rolling recession can be particularly hard to pin down, and contributes to a general state of uncertainty among experts baffled by recent economic trends.

'#WorkTok'

Many of these terms have at least one thing in common: they originated or spread on #WorkTok, the side of TikTok dedicated to workplace culture.

The hashtag has at least 2.3 billion views, spanning everything from life as a professional pastry chef, to HR best practices. Some experts say its rise was inevitable, as it's created a much-needed place for the ""watercooler talk"" many workers, especially young people, have been missing in a remote-work era.","Ten work buzzwords that took over in 2023By Lillian Stone Features correspondentAlamyMany of this year's buzzwords arrived and spread online through platforms including TikTok (Credit: Alamy)Largely originating on social media, this year's top jargon explains what workers want – and who they've become in a post-pandemic world.

Lukken waffles are crisp and buttery (Credit: Angela Dansby)

In her new book, Dark Rye and Honey Cake, Regula Ysewijn explains the history of Belgium waffles, and how to make the crisp, buttery lukken waffle for good luck in the new year.

There's no waffling about Belgium's baking heritage: waffles have a special place in the country's heart. In fact, the words ""Belgium"" and ""waffle"" are as synonymous as ""France"" and ""baguette"".

But there is no one single Belgian waffle, according to Regula Ysewijn, author of Dark Rye and Honey Cake: Festival Baking from the Heart of the Low Countries, published in 2023. The cookbook highlights her homeland of Belgium, featuring 13 different waffle recipes because just like Belgian beers, which are each served in a unique glass, every Belgian waffle is distinct. They differ in ingredients, shape, texture and even when and how they're eaten.

""Belgium has more waffle recipes than any other country,"" said Ysewijn, who does not have a favourite. ""They all have their importance. Just naming one to represent Belgium would be simplifying my food culture.""

In her cookbook, Ysewijn includes the round, caramelised Liège waffle from the 18th Century – named after the Belgian city in which it was invented – which is now one of the most common in Belgium and the only one justified as street food. She also shares a recipe for the rectangular, crispy Flemish waffle from the 19th Century, known today as the Brussels waffle. (This popular waffle is dusted with icing sugar and topped with optional items such as whipped cream, strawberries and chocolate syrup, though Ysewijn finds anything but cream on top to be ""an abomination"" regarding Belgian culinary tradition.)

Over the centuries, several specialty waffles were invented as well, including brittle, thin and buttery lukken, which were common among nobility. Lukken contain more sugar than other types of waffles and since sugar was once costly, lukken were associated with celebrations and the holidays, especially New Year's Day. ""Sugar makes these waffles crisp, caramelised and long-lasting,"" said Ysewijn.

No one knows exactly when the first waffle was invented, but Ysewijn notes the earliest known waffle iron in the Low Countries (this includes Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of northern France and western Germany) is displayed in the Gruuthusemuseum in Bruges, Belgium, and dates from between 1430 and 1450.

The first waffle recipes were recorded in books in the early 16th Century in the region of Belgium that is now Flanders. Chef Philippe Édouard Cauderlier, known as the ""father of Belgian cuisine"", wrote the first cookbook with regional Belgian recipes, Het Spaarzame Keukenboek in 1861, which included Flemish and Brussels waffles. By this time, there were tearooms serving waffles in every Belgian town and it was a custom around New Year's Day for families to go out for waffles, according to Ysewijn. Fancy waffle ""palaces"" (pop-up tearooms) also moved from town to town with fairs to serve waffles throughout the year.

Ironically, the United States coined the term ""Belgian waffle"" due to a branding accident at the New York World's Fair in 1964, Ysewijn said. That's where the Belgian Vermersch family had a waffle stand advertising ""Bel-Gem Brussels Waffles,"" a marketing play on the words ""Belgian"" and ""gem"", because the waffles were a culinary gem. But people interpreted (and media reported) the name as ""Belgian waffles"".

For centuries, waffles have been associated with winter and revelry, appearing at all feasts from St Martin's Day on 11 November to Christmas, New Year's Day, Carnival and Easter. During the Middle Ages, in much of western Europe, the new year started at Easter. But with the advent of the Gregorian calendar, the new year shifted to 1 January and the custom of baking waffles shifted with it.

Nowadays, waffles are eaten and prepared year-round in Belgium, but a few types, such as lukken, are specifically made at home for the new year. Derived from the Dutch word geluk for luck, lukken are made to bring good fortune. Lukken originated in the region of West Flanders, where the family tradition of baking them for New Year's Day remains.

""There is a lot of weighing and rolling the dough involved, hence why baking these waffles used to be a family activity – and it still is to this day in many households in West Flanders,"" Ysewijn said, adding that practically every Belgian family owns an electric waffle iron.

Despite their regional association with the new year, in the 16th and 17th Centuries, lukken were eaten after different festive meals and served with sweet or spiced wine. In 1890, baker Jules Destrooper of Lo, Belgium, started making a thinner version of lukken year-round as ""lukke"" or galettes au beurre (butter crisps). He popularised them throughout the country, and in 1949 his son began exporting them to the US, where they were equally well received. In 1969, Destrooper created ""butter waffles"", which are most similar to homemade lukken and still widely sold today.

But is making them at home the best way to bring good fortune in the new year? ""Of course!"" Ysewijn exclaimed. ""[Because] they bring luck immediately when people are making them.""

Lukken Waffle recipe By Regula Ysewijn

Makes 63 small waffles (3 per person)

Ingredients 250g (9oz) unsalted butter 2 medium eggs 475g (1lb 1oz) caster (superfine) sugar ⅛ tsp salt 2 tbsp cognac or rum (or water, if you don't want to use alcohol) 500g (1lb 2oz) flour

Method

Step 1 Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat and let it cool.

Step 2 In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the sugar, salt and cognac, then add the melted butter and combine well. Sift in the flour and knead to a smooth dough. Transfer the dough to an airtight container and leave to rest overnight in a cool place (not in the fridge).

Step 3 The next day, measure 20g (¾oz) nuggets of dough and shape them into ping pong-sized balls (2cm) or fat cigars, depending on the shape you want to achieve.

Step 4 Let your shallow electric or stovetop waffle iron get very hot and bake each waffle for 2-3 minutes or until they are a deep golden colour. Seconds mean the difference between golden and dark brown. There is no need to grease the irons as the dough doesn't stick. Once cool, store the waffles in an airtight container for up to three weeks.

Note To make these waffles, you will need an ice cream cone, shallow electric or stovetop waffle iron, not a traditional one. There is no substitute for a waffle iron and one with interchangeable plates is recommended.

Pakistan trail Australia by 124 runs after Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon took key wickets for the hosts on day two of the second Test in Melbourne.

Cummins removed Abdullah Shafique for 62 before dismissing Babar Azam and Agha Salman cheaply, while Lyon's spin saw off Imam-ul-Haq and Shan Masood.

The visitors ended the day on 194-6, with Mohammad Rizwan unbeaten on 29.

Marnus Labuschagne earlier helped guide Australia to 318 in their first innings with his 17th Test half-century.

Pakistan at one point were 124-1 in response and Australia captain Cummins said: ""They obviously batted quite well.

""But it was good at the end to get a few big wickets and it feels like we're well into their order now.""

Pakistan need to win in Melbourne to keep the three-match series alive after losing by 360 runs in Perth, and they took advantage of a pitch offering seam and swing to claim seven Australia wickets in the morning session.

Aamer Jamal was the visitors' top bowler, taking 3-64, but Cummins said he was satisfied to see Labuschagne's dogged 63 from 155 balls help the hosts to a healthy enough score after they resumed on 187-3.

Mitchell Marsh weighed in with 41, surviving two dismissals on review after being given out twice by umpire Joel Wilson to successive Hasan Ali deliveries when on seven.

Labuschagne's dismissal with the team score on 250, edging Jamal to Shafique, sparked a decline in Australian fortunes as the hosts went on to lose their final six wickets for 68 runs.

Nevertheless, Cummins said: ""I was actually really happy. I thought our batters did a great job to get us to 300, it was hard work.""

Pakistan falter after promising start

Pakistan made a decent start to their reply, despite the loss of Imam for 10, caught by Labuschagne at slip off Lyon.

Shafique reached his first Test half-century in Australia, and his fifth overall alongside four hundreds, with a four off Mitchell Starc as the visitors upped the run rate after tea.

But his 90-run partnership with Masood was broken by Cummins, who showed sharp reflexes to catch Shafique off his own bowling.

The visitors went on to lose five wickets for 46 runs.

Cummins bowled the dangerous Babar for one before Masood fell to Lyon, caught by Marsh for 54.

Josh Hazlewood bowled Saud Shakeel for nine and Cummins accounted for Salman, caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey for five, to leave the tourists in trouble.","Cummins removed Abdullah Shafique for 62 before dismissing Babar Azam and Agha Salman cheaply, while Lyon's spin saw off Imam-ul-Haq and Shan Masood.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67825330,Man Utd 3-2 Aston Villa: Rasmus Hojlund's first Red Devils goal marks start of new era,['Author not found'],"Rasmus Hojlund scored his first Premier League goal in his 15th top-flight appearance

He didn't know it at the time but, as Erik ten Hag looked across the home dressing room during the interval of his side's Premier League meeting with Aston Villa, the message he was about to deliver would be a symbolic one for Manchester United.

""I said at half-time: 'Keep believing and we will win.'""

With his team two goals down and their supporters mutinous, Ten Hag's words not only proved decisive to his team in their eventual thrilling victory, but were extra pertinent to Rasmus Hojlund as he scored the winner and served a reminder to the whole club about their eventual aims under new owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.

There was added significance to this success because they did it in front of Sir Dave Brailsford - the Ineos head of sport who, along with former Juventus chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc, will take up a seat on the football club board when Ratcliffe's purchase is confirmed in six-to-eight weeks' time.

""I don't know. You'll have to ask them,"" said Ten Hag, when asked what Brailsford and his colleagues thought of the performance.

""I said before the game that we were competitive with Arsenal and competitive with Liverpool so if we play our best we can beat anyone.""

'I had several talks with him... he had to believe'

There was a moment in the first half when Hojlund tried and failed to reach a low Alejandro Garnacho cross. A home supporter, seated not far from Brailsford, who was on the back row of the directors box with United's interim chief executive Patrick Stewart, yelled in frustration at the striker: 'Can't you make a decent run?'

The 20-year-old was in the middle of his 17th domestic game since a £64m move from Serie A outfit Atalanta. He was still to score and was looking less and less likely to break his duck.

But Ten Hag has never stopped believing in the Denmark striker. And Hojlund didn't allow his head to drop.

When Bruno Fernandes' 82nd-minute corner was stabbed in his direction by Villa skipper John McGinn after it had initially been flicked on by Jonny Evans, Hojlund reacted quickest, lashing the loose ball home from eight yards.

His relief was obvious as he raced to the corner flag before being submerged by team-mates. Even goalkeeper Andre Onana raced the length of the field to join in.

""I had several talks with him,"" recounted Ten Hag. ""I pointed out he scored a lot for Denmark and scored in the Champions League, so that demonstrated ability. He had to believe in it.

""When strikers don't score it is always a problem but he has a strong character and a big personality, which is what a striker needs. When he keeps investing, the goals will come and he will score more.""

Speaking on Match of the Day, former Newcastle forward Alan Shearer said the goal ""could be a game changer"" for Hojlund.

""He's had to put up with a lot, fairly at times and unfairly at times because of the lack of service,"" added Shearer.

""Going forward that could and should mean so much to him. We all talk about goals making the difference for forwards. That should be fantastic for him.""

Man Utd 'looking forward' with new investment

The victory eases the personal pressure on Ten Hag at a time of massive change at Old Trafford.

Not long after the final whistle, three documents relating to Ratcliffe's purchase of 25% of the club were published on the club's website.

One of them contained a lengthy email sent by co-chairs Joel and Avram Glazer to United employees.

""We understand this process has taken time and has inevitably created some uncertainty for colleagues,"" it said. ""But it has been important to conduct the strategic review thoroughly and to find the right partner to take us forward. Thank you for your patience.

""We are excited about the opportunity ahead and realistic about the hard work and commitment that it will require from everyone at Manchester United to help realise it. However, we know from more than 18 years' experience working with you, that we can count on your diligence, dedication, and ability.""

For all the soothing words, many inside United feel the conclusion of the search for strategic alternatives has taken too long.

Brailsford did not comment and in a letter to fans groups before the game, Ratcliffe said he would not be making any public statements before the deal is complete, so his views on Ten Hag's future, the current state of the Dutchman's squad and where the bulk of the money needed to refurbish Old Trafford is going to come from will have to wait.

It is unlikely Ineos will be able to play any significant role in United's business during next month's transfer window.

But Ten Hag welcomed their involvement and is convinced it can lead to significant improvement, on and off the pitch.

""We're looking forward,"" he said. ""I think it is positive for the club they are stepping in. They have a lot of experience in sport at the highest level - F1, a cycling team, football clubs. They can only help us and support us to get our targets.

""We are looking forward. They want to work with us and we want to work with them.""","You'll have to ask them,"" said Ten Hag, when asked what Brailsford and his colleagues thought of the performance.

Tottenham failed to win in three matches when Cristian Romero was suspended earlier in the season

Injury-hit Tottenham face losing centre-back Cristian Romero for up to five weeks with a hamstring strain, says manager Ange Postecoglou.

The 25-year-old Argentine picked up the injury during Saturday's 2-1 victory over Everton.

Defenders Micky van de Ven and Ryan Sessegnon are also out injured, while full-back Destiny Udogie is suspended for Thursday's match at Brighton.

""[It's] disappointing to lose [Romero], for sure,"" said Postecoglou.

""He had a scan the other day and has got a hamstring strain. We are looking at probably four or five weeks for him.""

World Cup winner Romero missed three matches through suspension in November and December after being sent off in Tottenham's 4-1 home defeat to Chelsea.

They picked up just one point in the centre-half's absence and lost to West Ham on his return, but have since won their past three matches.

Spurs are fourth in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool, who have played one game more.

""We obviously missed him with the suspension and now we've just got him back and he steadied things up,"" Postecoglou said.

""Now he will be missing again for quite a chunk of time.""

Netherlands defender Van de Ven had built up a promising partnership with Romero before he injured his hamstring against Chelsea in November.

Postecoglou says Van de Ven is ""getting closer"" to a return to first-team training, but believes the 22-year-old centre-back will not be ready until the Premier League match at Manchester United on 14 January.

""He is at the tail end of it, for sure,"" added Postecoglou. ""At some point, middle of January, he could be available, but how we use him after such a long absence will be depending on where he is at.""","Last updated on .From the section TottenhamTottenham failed to win in three matches when Cristian Romero was suspended earlier in the seasonInjury-hit Tottenham face losing centre-back Cristian Romero for up to five weeks with a hamstring strain, says manager Ange Postecoglou.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67825089,Burnley 0-2 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp praises Darwin Nunez but are Liverpool ruthless enough?,['Author not found'],"""Liverpool, top of the league, Liverpool, Liverpool, top of the league.""

That was the chant echoing around Turf Moor at full-time on Tuesday, as Jurgen Klopp's men ground out a 2-0 victory over Burnley to hit the summit of the Premier League.

With holders Manchester City lagging behind after last season's Treble-winning exertions, an opportunity has opened up for the Reds - or someone else - to end Pep Guardiola's side's stranglehold on the trophy.

Liverpool have only lost one league game this season but will need to be more ruthless than they have been in recent games if they are to add a second Premier League medal to their collection.

With Mohamed Salah departing for the Africa Cup of Nations in January, the goalscoring burden is likely to fall on Darwin Nunez - but how much can Liverpool rely on the Uruguay striker?

The 24-year-old ended a 12-game goal drought with the opener against Burnley, the first time he has found the net for his club since 1 November.

""For Darwin it's clear - strikers need goals,"" said Klopp. ""It was never in doubt from our side.

""Darwin is playing an incredibly important part for us. It's not only about scoring as long as you win, but it was important for him and gave him a lift.""

Klopp added: ""You miss chances and everybody says, 'You missed it in the last games as well'... but it has nothing to do with the last games, who cares? That is gone.

""We could have made it easier but as long as I am at Liverpool, we never did it the easy way. Why should we start now?""

'We should have been calmer'

When Nunez netted after only six minutes at Turf Moor, it looked like a scoreline more familiar to the neighbouring Burnley Cricket Club was on the cards.

But it took until the 90th minute for Diogo Jota to add a second goal, which rubberstamped the victory and secured top spot halfway through their season.

After a summer of upheaval in midfield, losing captain Jordan Henderson plus Fabinho, Naby Keita and James Milner, manager Klopp dubbed this side Liverpool 2.0, but they are yet to fully fire on all cylinders.

Liverpool have lost only one Premier League game so far this season at the halfway stage

This was an important victory after draws against Manchester United and title rivals Arsenal, but they surely need to improve their finishing if they are to maintain their position until May.

Over the last three league games, Liverpool have had a total of 66 attempts at goal - including 19 against Burnley - but have managed to convert only three goals.

They have also hit the woodwork 13 times this season, two more than any other side. Salah is top scorer with 12 in the league, but will miss up to eight games when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt in January.

Klopp said: ""I wasn't frustrated [at half-time]. It was clear we had to keep going. I was actually really happy with the game we played. We missed chances and I don't know exactly how many in the last 10 days.

""We should have been calmer and finished the game off much earlier. I know how intense the period has been and it is all about creating and getting through it and getting results.""

Liverpool rediscovering 'intensity'

Supporters will be dreaming about a record-equalling 20th title triumph after lifting the Premier League trophy behind closed doors at the end of the 2019-20 season.

Asked about being top of the table, Klopp jested: ""Fantastic, I can barely keep my arms down.

""But 42 points is really pleasing. The first part of the season is done and it was absolutely all right. Not perfect but we cannot be more than a point away from the top of the table if Arsenal win [on Thursday]. That is in punching distance.""

Burnley remain rooted in the bottom three, five points adrift of safety, and boss Vincent Kompany said of their opponents: ""It is a top team, there is no doubt.

""You play against the top sides and what is really apparent in this league is that every team at the top has a different style or idea behind it. Liverpool have different strengths to Tottenham or Arsenal or City.

""To be top in the Premier League, you have to have top players. If I think of my playing days, playing against one of the greatest sides we have had in recent history, in terms of quality the future will tell but in terms of intensity they are getting back to the levels I have known facing them as a player.""","""Liverpool, top of the league, Liverpool, Liverpool, top of the league.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/67827756,Sergiy Stakhovsky: Ukraine's ex-tennis star condemns IOC's Russia Olympics decision,['Author not found'],"Ukraine cherishes ""every single athlete we have"" as they might be the country's ""last star shining"", says former tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky.

The 37-year-old retired from tennis at the Australian Open in January 2022 to join Ukraine's reserve army.

""Ukraine, in terms of sport, has been crippled for generations to come,"" the 37-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Stakhovsky also criticised the decision to allow Russian athletes to compete as neutrals at the 2024 Olympic Games.

Athletes from Russia and its key ally Belarus who have qualified as individuals for next year's Games will compete without flags, emblems or anthems of their country.

This includes competitors who were previously banned following the invasion nearly two years ago, but teams representing the two nations will not feature.

Speaking from an undisclosed location in Ukraine, Stakhovsky, who famously beat Roger Federer in 2013 at Wimbledon, highlighted the number of athletes from the country who had lost their lives while fighting in the conflict.

According to the United Nations,, external at least 10,000 civilians, including more than 560 children, have been killed since the Russian invasion began in February 2022.

""It's going to be very hard for Ukraine to come back,"" said Stakhovsky.

""So we cherish every single athlete we have competing because we understand that might be our last star shining.""

While other high-profile Ukrainian sport stars have spoken out against the war, Stakhovsky feels more Russian athletes should publicly condemn the invasion.

Russian tennis players Andrey Rublev and Daria Kasatkina have spoken out against the war in recent years.

Rublev, 26, wrote an anti-war message on a camera lens at the Dubai Tennis Championship in 2022, while Kasatkina, 26, called for an end to the fighting on a Russian video blog in the same year.

""I do believe that if all the sports and all the people in Russia who are against the war would be the same vocal as [Kasatkina] was, there would be a completely different picture,"" Stakhovsky said.

In December, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said ""individual athletes cannot be punished for the acts of their governments"" as he explained the IOC's decision for next summer's Olympics in Paris.

Bach added that letting individuals compete was ""respecting human rights"".

""It's an absolute joke, in my opinion,"" said Stakhovsky.

""[Russian athletes] all say they are scared for their lives, for their families, but truth is no one lives in Russia any more. None of them live in Russia.

""For me, they don't want to be part of the criticism, they don't want to lose their fans back in Russia, so they with roll it.

""We have to look for athletes who support, we have to present evidence to the Olympic committee, and then maybe, if they believe that this is enough, they will not allow these athletes to compete.""","Ukraine cherishes ""every single athlete we have"" as they might be the country's ""last star shining"", says former tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67757165,Newcastle United 1-3 Nottingham Forest: Chris Wood hat-trick against former club helps visitors to stunning win,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Chris Wood's hat-trick was more goals than he managed in 18 Premier League appearances for Newcastle at St James' Park

Chris Wood scored a hat-trick on his return to St James' Park as Nottingham Forest ended a seven-game winless run with a stunning Premier League victory at Newcastle.

The result moves Forest up to 16th in the table and five points clear of the bottom three prior to Tuesday's other fixtures.

Alexander Isak had seemingly put Eddie Howe's side in control when he stroked home a penalty midway through the first half after going down under a challenge from Ola Aina.

But Newcastle only sporadically threatened in attack and always looked vulnerable to a rejigged Forest side set up to counter-attack at pace.

Morgan Gibbs-White dragged an early effort wide for the visitors, while Anthony Elanga missed two excellent opportunities before combining with the former England Under-21 midfielder to allow Wood to tap in a deserved equaliser against his old employers before the break.

Wood, who was Howe's second signing on Tyneside, added to his tally shortly after the interval, racing on to Elanga's pass and shimmying past home defender Dan Burn to lift the ball over goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.

He capped a fine display with another composed finish after Murillo's through ball sent him clear of an absent Newcastle defence.

Elanga and Gibbs-White both had chances to inflict further damage on the hosts, who remain seventh in the table after their fourth defeat in five Premier League games.

Wood and Gibbs-White star for revitalised Forest

Steve Cooper was sacked as Forest manager a week ago after presiding over a run of just one win in 13 top-flight games.

On this evidence, replacement Nuno Espirito Santo appears to have already begun to implement his own ideas to deliver some Christmas cheer to the City Ground.

Having made six changes to the starting XI that lost against Bournemouth on Saturday, he was rewarded by a purposeful display that saw Forest repeatedly cut through the visiting defence with some incisive counter-attacking.

Wood's sharpness in front of goal belied the fact he was only starting his fifth league game of the season, having largely been utilised as a substitute by Cooper.

While the New Zealand striker will rightly take the plaudits for his match-winning contribution, others in red also excelled.

Forest captain Gibbs-White, who got the better of Bruno Guimaraes in midfield, could also arguably lay claim to being the game's outstanding player and ought really to have capped a fine display with a couple of goals.

And aside from some wasteful finishing and a poor decision not to slide another first-half pass across to Wood, Elanga provided an excellent outlet for Forest on the right.

Newcastle's impressive home run ends

While Newcastle came into this contest amid a poor run of their own, there was still an expectation that they would stretch their impressive home record to eight consecutive top-flight victories.

When Aina's slight contact on the calf of Isak gave them a first-half penalty, which was duly dispatched, they were seemingly on their way.

However, the Swede struggled after that, heading a decent chance straight at Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner and also scuffing a low close-range effort in the second period that the United States international kept out with some help from Moussa Niakhate, who blocked Anthony Gordon's follow-up attempt.

What would have displeased Howe the most was the way his side were repeatedly picked off on the break, as they fell to their first home defeat against Forest in the top tier since October 1988.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67757164,Man Utd 3-2 Aston Villa: Rasmus Hojlund fires United to comeback win over Villa,['Author not found'],"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Rasmus Hojlund joined Manchester United for £64m last summer, a fee which could rise to £72m with add-ons

Rasmus Hojlund scored his first Premier League goal as Manchester United fought back from two goals down to record a sensational victory in a thrilling encounter with Aston Villa at Old Trafford.

In United's first game since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25% purchase of the club, and with future director and current Ineos head of sport Sir Dave Brailsford in the directors' box, Erik ten Hag's side produced one of those 'back-from-the-dead' endings for which they are so famed.

After John McGinn and Leander Dendoncker had given Villa a deserved half-time advantage, United rallied after the interval and refused to let their heads drop even after Alejandro Garnacho had a goal disallowed by the video assistant referee for a marginal offside decision.

It was the 19-year-old Argentine who led the fightback, scoring twice in a game for the first time in his career to turn the game on its head.

Villa did their best to stem the wave of home attacks.

But, just as Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest discovered here in August, United retain some of the old doggedness from the Sir Alex Ferguson days.

And, for the home fans at least, there could be no more fitting scorer than Hojlund, who reacted quickest and rammed the ball home after Bruno Fernandes' corner had struck McGinn and bounced free inside a packed penalty area.

The relief for Hojlund and his team-mates was clear to see, with goalkeeper Andre Onana racing the full length of the pitch to join in the celebrations as Ten Hag bounced in delight, his fists clenched in evident celebration.

Garnacho turns the game on its head

Alejandro Garnacho's goals came in the 59th and 71st minute, cancelling out Villa's two-goal lead

Brailsford made his name with the theory of 'marginal gains' which brought him such success on the cycling front.

Small events also make big differences in football. With the game at 2-2 and Old Trafford in a frenzy, Villa launched a counter.

McGinn collected possession and took aim inside the penalty area. The shot was goalbound but veteran central defender Jonny Evans - who would not even be playing without the huge run of injuries that has decimated Ten Hag's squad and cost him the services of international duo Luke Shaw and Sofyan Amrabat from the squad beaten at West Ham at the weekend - stuck out his left leg and turned the ball away.

It allowed the hosts to maximise their profit from Garnacho's double, securing a win that leaves them just three points behind Manchester City, albeit the new world champions have two games in hand.

In a team that has found it hard to score goals, Garnacho picked exactly the right time to locate his shooting boots.

The youngster's pace and movement has been a problem for many defences this term. Tonight, he also had an end product.

The first was a relative tap-in as Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford combined, just as they had done for his disallowed goal, to set Garnacho up.

The second required more involvement, as Garnacho initially fed Fernandes, whose low cross bounced back to the winger, whose shot struck a defender and looped in.

From delight to despair for Villa

Aston Villa would have gone level on points with Liverpool at the top of the table with victory

Whilst Brailsford was looking down on proceedings from the top row of the directors' box, sat alongside interim chief executive Patrick Stewart, Ten Hag seemed like a man on his own as that torrid first half unfolded, his hands stuffed in his coat pocket, the Dutchman seemingly incapable of doing anything to change his side's miserable fortunes.

Just in front of Brailsford sat former United keeper Edwin van der Sar, thankfully making a positive recovery from his recent brain haemorrhage.

Van der Sar knows Ten Hag and Andre Onana well from his time as Ajax chief executive. He has huge faith in Onana's abilities.

One can only wonder what he must have made of Villa's opener as McGinn's free-kick was allowed to bounced into the six-yard area and into the far corner, Onana rooted to his position and none of his defenders stepping in to clear.

Five minutes later, Villa profited from more abysmal defending as Clement Lenglet was allowed to run unmarked to the far post to head McGinn's corner back into the danger area, where Dendoncker flicked home the visitors' second.

The boos were audible - and were repeated at the half-time whistle as Ten Hag strode down the touchline, a now familiar scowl on his face.

By that point, Emiliano Martinez had saved twice from Rashford and also denied Hojlund.

As United chased a way back into the game, Martinez looked like a composed figure. His crunching tackle on Rashford to win the ball epitomised the effort Villa were putting in to secure a rare Old Trafford win that would have taken them second.

But it was another, younger, Argentine, who was to have the last laugh, with Hojlund supplying the key moment at the end to start paying back that £64m transfer fee that has weighed upon him since his July move from Atalanta.

His crunching tackle on Rashford to win the ball epitomised the effort Villa were putting in to secure a rare Old Trafford win that would have taken them second."
