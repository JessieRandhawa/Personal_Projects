By Chloe Kim BBC News

Federal prosecutors have charged Hunter Biden with evading $1.4m (£1.1m) in tax payments, a second criminal case against the US president's son.

The nine-count indictment also details a lavish spending spree including drugs and escorts over the same period, from 2016 to 2019.

Mr Biden, 53, was indicted in September for owning a gun while on drugs and not declaring his addictions on a form.

His lawyer said on Thursday night the new charges are politically motivated.

President Joe Biden is not mentioned in the indictment and the White House has not commented.

It comes as congressional Republicans place Hunter Biden's business dealings at the centre of an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, who is seeking re-election next year.

If convicted in the tax case, Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison.

The three felonies and six misdemeanours include failure to file and pay taxes, false tax return and evasion of assessment.

US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss has been investigating the Yale-educated lawyer and recovering crack cocaine addict since 2019.

In a 56-page indictment filed in California, prosecutors allege he spent his money on ""drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes"".

They say the president's son ""individually received more than $7 million in total gross income"" between 2016 and 2020, but ""willfully failed to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxes on time, despite having access to funds to pay some or all of these taxes"".

Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, responded to the new charges by saying that ""if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought"".

Hunter Biden eventually paid all his taxes and fines back in 2020 - with the help of a loan from his personal attorney.

A chart inside the indictment outlines what Hunter Biden spent his money on.

Between 2016-19, he paid over $188,000 for ""adult entertainment"" and over $683,000 on ""payments - various women"", according to the charge sheet.

Hunter Biden ""continued to earn handsomely and to spend wildly in 2018"", prosecutors allege.

The indictment notes he made ""substantial"" income, including from a company he formed with a Chinese business conglomerate, the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and an unnamed Romanian businessperson.

As his income increased, so did his expenditures on an ""extravagant lifestyle"", says the indictment.

Hunter Biden tells BBC News his father ""saved"" him several times when he was in a dark place with his addiction battle

In 2018, the defendant spent more than $1.8m, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals, about $383,000 in payments to women and $151,000 on clothing.

Yet that same year, Hunter Biden texted his ex-wife that he could not make his alimony payment ""due to insufficient funds"".

He meanwhile stayed at various luxury hotels, spent $10,000 ""to purchase a membership in a sex club"" and claimed that $1,248 cross country airline tickets for an exotic dancer were a business expense, according to the indictment.

Prosecutors note that he ""had sufficient funds available… to pay some or all of his outstanding taxes when they were due"", but chose not to do so.

He allegedly often wrote off personal expenses as business expenses, like a rental of a Lamborghini that he drove when he first moved to California in April 2018 until his Porsche arrived from the east coast.

Earlier this year, Hunter Biden had been expected to plead guilty to misdemeanour tax charges in a deal with prosecutors.

But that agreement fell apart after a judge questioned it as ""unusual"". Congressional Republicans later slammed it as a ""sweetheart deal"".

This summer, two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whistleblowers testified to Congress that Hunter Biden should have been charged with more serious tax crimes, but alleged he received lenient treatment as the son of the president.

Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler said Thursday's indictment serves as ""complete vindication"".

The federal gun charges filed in September related to his being in possession of a gun while using narcotics and lying on a form about it. He pleaded not guilty.

By Paul Adams BBC News, Jerusalem

Watch: The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen on what the images show

With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel.

The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers.

The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip.

The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released.

One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out ""invasive searches and humiliating treatment"" of civilians.

Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been ""discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago"".

In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them.

Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered.

Another image - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that ""IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects"".

""Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting.""

On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as ""Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"".

""We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago,"" he said.

Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to ""work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not"".

He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in ""close-quarter combat"" with Hamas. They had been ""deliberately disguising themselves as civilians"" and operating from civilian buildings.

The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia.

The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools.

The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said.

The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention.

In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as ""savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"".

""This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history,"" Husam Zomlot said.

A picture of the men, verified by the BBC, has been circulating on social media

Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees.

The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and ""other civilians"" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia.

Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the ""humiliating"" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday.

It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and ""subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations"".

The outlet ""urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault"" by Israel on journalists in the territory.

A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout.

Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim.

""We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked,"" she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.

By Chloe Kim BBC News

Watch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocide

A major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president.

In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished.

Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus.

She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign.

US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"".

American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago.

Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth.

They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?""

Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"".

There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks.

""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah.

In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill.""

The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"".

Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members.

Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates.

The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre.

University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has faced mounting calls to resign after her congressional testimony

Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position.

She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"".

She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"".

While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation.

He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"".

On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership.

""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test.""

A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon.

Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"".

The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"".

""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement.

Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination.""

The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"".

Islamophobic attacks have also been on the rise on university campuses.","Elizabeth Magill: UPenn loses $100m donation after House antisemitism testimonyBy Chloe Kim BBC NewsWatch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocideA major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president.

The home where the famed civil rights leader spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmark

Alert bystanders stopped a woman as she attempted to set fire to the birth home of Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta, Georgia, police say.

Officials said the prompt action ""saved an important part of American history"".

The accused is in custody and faces charges of arson for allegedly pouring petrol onto the property.

The two-storey house where Dr King spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmark.

Its interior was acquired by the National Park Service in 2018 and has been closed to the public since last month for repairs and renovations.

Officers responded to the vandalism in progress in the city's Auburn Avenue Historic District about 17:45 local time (22:45 GMT) on Thursday, Atlanta police said in a news release.

A video shared with the local WSB-TV news channel shows a woman dressed in all black dousing the porch and front windows of the home.

By the time police arrived, the suspect had been stopped by two visiting filmmakers from Utah and two off-duty police officers from New York who were also visiting the home, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum told reporters.

One of the filmmakers, Zach Kempf, told the New York Times he initially thought the woman was watering shrubs in front of the house before she rushed up the stairs and pulled on the front screen door.

She did not respond when they asked what she was doing, emptying the contents of a five-gallon container before tossing it into the bushes and grabbing a lighter she had left on the grass, he said.

Mr Kempf, 43, said the woman had a ""nervous energy"" but was not aggressive and walked away after he physically blocked her path.

It was he who called 911 and shouted for help to the two New York officers, who chased down the suspect and restrained her until local police arrived.

The 26-year-old woman's father and three sisters, who arrived on the scene later, described her as a veteran in mental distress, Mr Kempf told the Times.

The accused was receiving a mental health evaluation before being transferred to the local jail, police said on Thursday night.

She could face further federal charges over her actions.

Local fire officials said no damage was done to the home and a hazardous materials team was cleaning up the scene.

""If the witnesses hadn't been here and interrupted what she was doing, it could have been a matter of seconds before the house was engulfed in flames,"" fire chief Jerry DeBerry said.

""It was really about the timing and the witnesses being in the right place at the right time.""

In a statement, the King Center confirmed the arson attempt had been unsuccessful ""thanks to the brave intervention of good Samaritans and the quick response of law enforcement"".

""Our prayers are with the individual who allegedly committed this criminal act,"" it added.","MLK house: Bystanders prevent attempt to burn down Dr King's birth homeBy Sam Cabral BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe home where the famed civil rights leader spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmarkAlert bystanders stopped a woman as she attempted to set fire to the birth home of Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta, Georgia, police say.

The Super Gremlin rapper has faced several drug offences before

Rapper Kodak Black, who was pardoned three years ago by Donald Trump, has been arrested in Florida on drugs charges.

Officers said they noticed a strong smell of marijuana from a black Bentley SUV with the 26-year-old asleep at the wheel inside.

According to CBS News, police found a white powder later confirmed to be cocaine when they searched the vehicle.

Black, appeared in court on Thursday and was freed on a $75,000 bond.

The rapper, real name Bill Kapri, was accused of possession of cocaine, tampering with physical evidence and improperly stopping or parking a vehicle.

Regular drug testing is a condition of his release.

The Super Gremlin artist was also arrested last year on charges of trafficking in oxycodone and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription.

After reportedly failing to show up for multiple drug tests, he was ordered to spend 30 days in rehab earlier this year.

In January 2021, Black was on a list of more than 140 people who were pardoned by then-US president Donald Trump.

He had been sentenced to almost four years in jail in 2019 for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

But he served only half of his sentence after Trump intervened.

Following his release, Black thanked Trump on his track Last Day In and also expressed his support for the former president on social media.

The rapper has sold more than 30 million singles and has collaborated with artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott and Jason Derulo.","Kodak Black arrested on cocaine charges in FloridaBy Jasmine Sandhar BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Super Gremlin rapper has faced several drug offences beforeRapper Kodak Black, who was pardoned three years ago by Donald Trump, has been arrested in Florida on drugs charges.

Mr Putin would be 77 at the end of his fifth term

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will stand again for a fifth term in office.

He announced it at an awards ceremony for participants of the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine in 2022.

It comes a day after election officials set 15-17 March 2024 as dates for the presidential election.

The re-election of Mr Putin, 71, is seen as inevitable, with opposition almost non-existent and Russian media completely under his control.

Mr Putin served as president in 2000-08, returning to the role from a stint as prime minister in 2012. This means that he has already been in power in Russia longer than any ruler since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

Russia's constitution was amended in 2020, increasing the presidential term from four to six years and giving Mr Putin a clean slate to run again next year by cancelling out his previous terms.

A victory in March would see him remain as president until 2030. After that, he can then potentially serve another six years until 2036 if he decides to stand again.

Mr Putin - a former KGB officer - had been widely expected to run for the country's top job, amid huge challenges brought about by his invasion of Ukraine and resulting stand-off with the West.

He is unlikely to face any serious opposition, with most genuine opponents either dead, behind bars or in exile.

On Thursday, Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, announced the elections. Shortly afterwards, the country's electoral commission said they would be held over three days, from 15-17 March.

Following the announcement, the Kremlin's official spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that an ""astonishing"" number of people wanted Mr Putin to continue as leader.

He did not take long to make his intentions clear.

Mr Putin spoke at an informal gathering after a ceremony in the Kremlin to award Ukraine war veterans with the Hero of Russia medal.

His words were in answer to a request that he stand again for election from Lt-Col Artyom Zhoga, who heads a former pro-Russian separatist unit in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region - which Moscow declared annexed together with another three Ukrainian regions in September 2022.

""Now is the time when one needs to take decisions. I will be running for the post of president of the Russian Federation,"" Mr Putin said in remarks shown on Russian TV.

Mr Putin was handed the presidency at the very end of 1999 by his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin.

Consumer spending is the main driver of the US economy

Jobs growth in the US was stronger than expected last month, in part boosted as striking workers in Hollywood and the car industry returned to work.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said.

That helped to push down the jobless rate to 3.7% - the lowest level since July.

The monthly report is being closely watched as the US central bank tries to cool the economy to reduce inflation, the rate at which prices rise.

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to the highest level in more than two decades in an attempt to slow price rises, and investors are increasingly betting that rates have peaked for now and may even start to fall next year.

But the latest figures, while welcome news for jobseekers, may confound those hopes.

As well as stronger-than-expected job gains, the report showed average hourly pay ticking up 0.4% from October.

Average hourly earnings have climbed 4% from November 2022 - a rate that analysts said was too fast for the Fed to declare its job is done.

The strength of the US economy over the past year has defied expectations and persistently glum economic sentiment.

In the most recent quarter, it expanded at an annual rate of 5.2% - well above the trend in pre-pandemic years.

A strong labour market has helped sustain consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - though some retailers have warned of weakening sales in recent weeks.

Last month's job gains were driven by hiring at health care and manufacturing firms, as well as the government.

Payrolls at retail, warehousing and transportation firms fell, despite heading into the holiday season.

Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop could be a sign that ""retailers are already nervous"", but might also reflect quirks from the Labor Department's efforts to adjust for seasonal trends.

Overall, the US has added an average of 240,000 jobs per month over the past year, the Labor Department said.

""While job growth is falling compared to last year, it is holding up remarkably well in the face of a tough economic picture and slowing growth globally,"" said Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot.

When the Fed started raising interest rates, many analysts warned it could trigger an economic recession, if higher borrowing costs prompted firms and households to slow spending dramatically.

That forecast has been increasingly abandoned.","US jobless rate falls to lowest level since JulyGetty ImagesConsumer spending is the main driver of the US economyJobs growth in the US was stronger than expected last month, in part boosted as striking workers in Hollywood and the car industry returned to work.

Key moments from Google's Gemini demo

A video showcasing the capabilities of Google's artificial intelligence (AI) model which seemed too good to be true might just be that.

The Gemini demo, which has 1.6m views on YouTube, shows a remarkable back-and-forth where an AI responds in real time to spoken-word prompts and video.

In the video's description, Google said all was not as it seemed - it had sped up responses for the sake of the demo.

But it has also admitted the AI was not responding to voice or video at all.

In a blog post published at the same time as the demo, Google reveals how the video was actually made.

Subsequently, as first reported by Bloomberg Opinion, Google confirmed to the BBC it was in fact made by prompting the AI by ""using still image frames from the footage, and prompting via text"".

""Our Hands on with Gemini demo video shows real prompts and outputs from Gemini,"" said a Google spokesperson.

""We made it to showcase the range of Gemini's capabilities and to inspire developers.""

The demo

In the video, a person asks a series of questions to Google's AI while showing objects on the screen.

For example, at one point the demonstrator holds up a rubber duck and asks Gemini if it will float.

Initially, it is unsure what material it is made of, but after the person squeezes it - and remarks this causes a squeaking sound - the AI correctly identifies the object.

However, what appears to happen in the video at first glance is very different from what actually happened to generate the prompts.

The AI was actually shown a still image of the duck, and asked what material it was made of. It was then fed a text prompt explaining that the duck makes a squeaking noise when squeezed, resulting in the correct identification.

In another impressive moment, the person performs a cups and balls routine - a magic trick where a ball is hidden underneath one of three moving cups - and the AI is able to determine where it moved to.

But again, as the AI was not responding to a video, this was actually achieved by showing it a series of still images.

In its blog post, Google explained that in fact it told the AI where a ball was underneath three cups, and showed it images which represent cups being swapped.

It's not quite the same as AI responding to a live video

Google clarified that the demo was created by capturing footage from the video, in order to ""test Gemini's capabilities on a wide range of challenges"".

While sequences were shortened and stills were used, the voiceover from the video is taken directly from the written prompts fed into Gemini.

But there is another element of the video which further stretches the truth.

At one point, the user places down a world map, and asks the AI: ""Based on what you see, come up with a game idea... and use emojis.""

The AI responds by apparently inventing a game called ""guess the country"", in which it gives clues (such as a kangaroo and koala) and responds to a correct guess of the user pointing at a country (in this case, Australia).

Google

The guess-the-country game as showcased in the demo

But in fact, according to Google's blog, the AI did not invent this game at all.

Instead, the AI was given the following instructions: ""Let's play a game. Think of a country and give me a clue. The clue must be specific enough that there is only one correct country. I will try pointing at the country on a map,"" the prompt read.

The user then gave the AI examples of a correct and incorrect answer.

After this point, Gemini was able to generate clues, and identify whether the user was pointing to the correct country or not from stills of a map.

It is impressive - but it is not the same as claiming the AI invented the game.

Google's AI model is impressive regardless of its use of still images and text-based prompts - but those facts mean its capabilities are very similar to that of OpenAI's GPT-4.

And it is noteworthy that the video was released just two weeks after a period of unprecedented chaos in the AI space, following Sam Altman's dramatic firing - and rehiring - as CEO of OpenAI.","Google admits AI viral video was edited to look betterBy Tom Gerken Technology reporterGoogleKey moments from Google's Gemini demoA video showcasing the capabilities of Google's artificial intelligence (AI) model which seemed too good to be true might just be that.

The US imports about 500,000kg of garlic a year

A US senator has called for a government investigation into the impact on national security of garlic imports from China.

Republican Senator Rick Scott has written to the commerce secretary, claiming Chinese garlic is unsafe, citing unsanitary production methods.

China is the world's biggest exporter of fresh and chilled garlic and the US is a major consumer.

But the trade has been controversial for many years.

The US has accused China of ""dumping"" garlic on to the market at below-cost price.

Since the mid-1990s it has levied heavy tariffs or taxes on Chinese imports in order to prevent US producers from being priced out of the market.

In 2019, during the Trump administration, these tariffs were increased.

In his letter Senator Scott refers to these existing concerns. But he goes on to highlight ""a severe public health concern over the quality and safety of garlic grown in foreign countries - most notably, garlic grown in Communist China"".

He refers to practices which, he says, have been ""well documented"" in online videos, cooking blogs and documentaries, including growing garlic in sewage.

He has called for the Department of Commerce to take action, under a law which allows investigations into the impact of specific imports on the security of the US.

Senator Scott also goes into much detail about the different types of garlic that should be looked into: ""All grades of garlic, whole or separated into cloves, whether or not peeled, chilled, fresh, frozen, provisionally preserved or packed in water or other neutral substance.""

He argues: ""Food safety and security is an existential emergency that poses grave threats to our national security, public health, and economic prosperity.""

The Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Quebec, which attempts to popularise and explain scientific issues, says there is ""no evidence"" that sewage is used as a fertiliser for growing garlic in China.

""In any case, there is no problem with this,"" an article published by the university in 2017 says.","Chinese garlic is a national security risk, says US senatorBy Theo Leggett Business correspondent, BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe US imports about 500,000kg of garlic a yearA US senator has called for a government investigation into the impact on national security of garlic imports from China.

BBC

Kigali can bee seen from the upper floors of the empty hostel that will put up people sent from the UK

This week, Rwanda has been at the centre of a debate in UK politics about whether the government's latest attempt to offshore some of its asylum seekers to the East African nation will work. But what do people in Rwanda make of the scheme?

The atmosphere in Hope Hostel is eerie.

Its 50 double rooms are cleaned daily, toiletries and slippers wait for new arrivals that are yet to come. Located in the affluent Kagugu suburb of Rwanda's capital, Kigali, you can see the presidential palace from some of the rooms' balconies.

It used to be a refuge for survivors of the 1994 genocide, in which about 800,000 people were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists targeting the Tutsi minority.

Last year, it was then repurposed to host the asylum seekers who were going to be relocated from Britain.

It has 50 double rooms and can host up to 100 guests.

Qurans and prayer mats have been set up in each room.

Ismail Bakina, the hostel's managing director, says they were told many of the new arrivals would be Muslims from the Middle East and they wanted to accommodate their faith.

All the signs around the hostel are in English and Arabic.

And the restaurant has a big halal placard above the kitchen. Two prayer rooms on the top floors have breath-taking views of Kigali's rolling green hills.

Hope Hostel reception is still waiting to welcome its first guest

A BBC crew visited the hostel a year ago as it was getting ready to receive the first arrivals from the UK. Now, a year-and-a-half later, it still stands empty.

It is part of what we now know is a £240m ($300m) payment the UK made as part of its deal with Rwanda to settle some of its asylum seekers here.

The refugees would be given the option to stay in Rwanda or re-settle to another country.

Twenty-five-year-old journalist Providence Uwase is happy about the arrangement and thinks the deal could be good for Rwanda.

""Money is being injected into the country. Remember the UK has already provided the first instalment, which in return will support economic growth here,"" she tells the BBC.

""And the fact that Rwanda takes these asylum seekers in, might change the negative depiction of this country.""

But not everyone agrees.

UK Home Secretary James Cleverly and Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta say their two countries are in a partnership

Many of the people we speak to will not criticise the government on the record. They worry there might be repercussions in a country which rights groups have criticised for not allowing free expression.

A 42-year-old Kigali café owner, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity, is torn about whether the scheme will benefit the country.

""I think it's double-sided.

""On a positive note, by bringing these people here, in the long term… we'll become more multicultural. But the downside is that this is a tiny, densely populated country with minimal or no access to basic opportunities. What happens if foreigners come in to compete for the same opportunities?""

It is also not clear whether the new legislation, if passed in Westminster, will get stuck in a court battle.

Last month the UK Supreme Court judged a previous version of the scheme unlawful on the basis that it could not be sure Rwanda was a safe third country to send vulnerable asylum seekers to.

Opposition politician Victoire Ingabire agrees.

""I was surprised that the British government wanted to push this deal forward. They've signed a new treaty, but Rwanda's human rights record was one of the problems highlighted by the Supreme Court. If human rights issues are not addressed I think this treaty will face another legal challenge,"" she says.

The Rwandan government says it has always been important to both Rwanda and the UK that their partnership meet the highest standards of international law.

It also objects to being called unsafe, adding that the funding by the British government will ensure the asylum seekers it sends to Kigali are well taken care of.

In a press conference with British Home Secretary James Cleverly on Tuesday in Kigali, Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta said his country had a long history of welcoming refugees from around the world, including African migrants who were stuck in Libya and are now having their asylum cases processed in Rwanda.

He was referring to the Gashora transit camp, which we visit on a hot Thursday afternoon.

Cameroonian Berenice Nonga says Rwanda is a good home for refugees but wants to be re-located to the US

Forty-two-year-old Berenice Nonga is one of the residents.

She is happy here, but applied for asylum in the US. Her application has been successful and she hopes to move soon.

""Rwanda is really good, it's home for all the refugees, the people are welcoming, they take good care of us. But since I never intended to spend all my life in Rwanda, that's why I asked to be resettled somewhere else so that I can give my child a good life.""

She is not the only one. Of the almost 2,000 people who have been relocated to the transit camp in Gashora since it was set up in 2019, none opted to stay in Rwanda when given the option, preferring instead to move to another country.

Back in Kigali, 26-year-old South Sudanese refugee John (not his real name) also says he does not want to stay in Rwanda.

""I have no reason to stay in Rwanda. I don't see my life staying in Rwanda. All I do here is a struggle, I'm trying to build up a life out of a struggle.""

John moved to Rwanda in 2017.

""I'm grateful to the government of Rwanda for giving me refugee status, but when I think about my growth, I don't feel proud to be in Rwanda.""

He says although some refugees like the dozens of female students Rwanda took in from Afghanistan live in good hostels and are well taken care of, others like him are left to rot in camps for years. He does not think the UK should send its asylum seekers to Rwanda.

""Suella Braverman [who was home secretary at the time] came here to look into the living conditions of refugees. But she didn't meet the people who would have told her the truth about what it's like to be a refugee here before deciding to send asylum seekers here.","Last year, it was then repurposed to host the asylum seekers who were going to be relocated from Britain.

Elon Musk speaking at an event in New York last month

Elon Musk has said Disney boss Bob Iger should be ""fired immediately"" after the company stopped advertising on X.

""Walt Disney is turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company,"" Mr Musk said in a series of posts against the media giant.

It comes just a week after he told companies that joined an ad boycott of his platform, formerly known as Twitter, to ""Go [expletive] yourself"".

Some firms have paused advertising on X amid concerns over antisemitism.

Disney did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on Friday.

Mr Iger made a shock return to Disney just over a year ago - less than 12 months after retiring - to steer it through turbulent times, as its share price plummeted and streaming service Disney+ continued to make a loss.

During his first leadership stint at the company, he was credited for driving major acquisitions involving the likes of animation studio Pixar, comic book company Marvel, Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and Lucasfilm, the home of Star Wars.

These moves, as well as amusement park openings, helped the company's market value increase fivefold.

But his second time around has been dominated by job cuts and other challenges.

In a post on Thursday, Mr Musk appeared to allude to the recent weak box-office performances of some Disney firms, saying Mr Iger dropped ""more bombs than a B-52"".

The multi-billionaire also accused Disney of advertising on other social media platforms that allowed controversial materials.

Last week, in a profanity-laced outburst at an event in New York, Mr Musk slammed advertisers that had left X and warned that they would kill the social media platform.

He also accused companies including Disney, Apple and Comcast, which have paused advertising on the site, of trying to blackmail him.

""I don't want them to advertise,"" Mr Musk said in response to a question at the New York Times' DealBook Summit.

""If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money go [expletive] yourself.

""Go. [Expletive]. Yourself. Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you're in the audience, that's how I feel.""

Mr Musk was apparently referring to Mr Iger, who spoke at the summit earlier in the day.

X's chief executive Linda Yaccarino, who also attended the summit, has since reposted what she called Mr Musk's ""candid interview"".

She added her perspective on advertising that ""X is standing at a unique and amazing intersection of Free Speech and Main Street — and the X community is powerful and is here to welcome you"".

Mr Musk has been on a visit to Israel after he appeared to personally back an antisemitic conspiracy theory last month. He denied the post was antisemitic but apologised, saying it might have been the ""dumbest"" thing he had ever shared online.

However, many advertisers had already chosen to spend their money elsewhere.

In July, Mr Musk acknowledged in a post on X that ad revenue had fallen by 50%.

His brash presence on social media has also caused trouble for his other companies, including Tesla.

In 2018 Mr Musk and the electric car company paid $40m to settle charges that he had defrauded investors with a post that claimed he had ""funding secured"" to buy the publicly listed firm and take it private.

As part of the settlement with financial regulators, Mr Musk agreed to set up a process to give Tesla more oversight over his social media posts about the firm.

He has since repeatedly tried to end the deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying it infringes on his constitutional right to free speech and is an overreach of power.

On Thursday he took that appeal to the top court in the US, asking the Supreme Court to decide the matter.","Disney: Elon Musk calls for boss to be fired over ad spatBy Annabelle Liang Business reporterEPAElon Musk speaking at an event in New York last monthElon Musk has said Disney boss Bob Iger should be ""fired immediately"" after the company stopped advertising on X.

Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott has apologised for referencing the 9/11 hijackers in a team meeting in 2019.

He said that after realising how the message at the 2019 training camp sounded, he called another meeting an hour later to apologise to his players.

""It was mentioning 9/11 in the context of the team meeting - the goal of the meeting was about the importance of communication and being on the same page as a team,"" he said.

By Merlyn Thomas and Ethar Shalaby BBC Verify and BBC Arabic

Feras Al-Shaer

As Israel presses its military offensive across Gaza, the army has been repeatedly advising some two million civilians to move to a ""humanitarian zone"" smaller than London's Heathrow Airport.

Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea. It has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land.

The zone designated as safe by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), is just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles).

Reem Abd Rabu has spent the last few weeks sleeping on the ground and sharing a tent with four other families in the area.

She is one of the 1.8 million Palestinians who have been displaced since the war began on 7 October after Hamas's attack on Israel.

She first travelled to Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza, but after nearby houses were bombed, she said she felt she had to go to the place the Israeli army identified on the map as safe.

Reem told the BBC al-Mawasi was an abandoned place, ""not a place for human beings"".

She thought it would be safe from the intense bombardment and fighting, but when she arrived, she found little to no basic services.

""Water comes one day and not for the next 10 days, even in the bathrooms. And it's the same thing for electricity,"" she told the BBC.

The IDF has urged civilians to move to al-Mawasi on at least 15 occasions on social media, the last on 2 December.

Getty Images

Although the UN is distributing some supplies, civilians say there is a lack of basic necessities in the area

The first mention of the humanitarian zone was on 18 October, when the IDF's Arabic spokesperson posted on X: ""The IDF orders Gaza residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the area of al-Mawasi, to which international humanitarian aid will be directed if necessary.""

Another post, from 21 October, stated: ""If your life and the lives of those you love are important to you, head south of Wadi Gaza. We advise you to arrive at the humanitarian area in Mawasi according to our instructions.""

Little to no internet connectivity has made it difficult for people to find safe areas in other parts of Gaza.

However, even the IDF instructions on al-Mawasi have changed several times. Civilians say the changing messaging has made it difficult for them to know exactly where to find safety there too.

Each IDF post has been accompanied by a map pinpointing a small area within al-Mawasi that Gazans should evacuate to.

But different areas in al-Mawasi have been designated as ""humanitarian zones"" by Israel on different dates.

On 18 October, the IDF designated the humanitarian zone marked in purple below. But three days later, the IDF declared a different area - shown in blue.

Then, on 30 October, the area changed again - to the one marked in green.

'Every day danger increases'

Mona al-Astal, who has also fled to al-Mawasi, says she is kept awake all night by the sound of shelling.

She is a doctor who says she was forced to leave Khan Younis after her neighbour's home was bombed.

Mona also describes a lack of water, electricity and supplies in the humanitarian zone. She said she had been forced to buy a tent and other supplies for $300 (£238).

Mona said that she had seen people breaking into a UN agency storehouse because ""they were so hungry, they have nothing to eat"".

To make matters worse, diseases including lice, chicken pox and intestinal infections have become widespread among children, she says.

""With every day that passes, the danger for us here increases,"" Mona added.

Mohammed Ghanem fled from an area near al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza where he said more than 25 strikes occurred next to his house.

He said he came to al-Mawasi because ""the Israeli army has been directing people here"" but said the area was ""neither humane nor safe"".

He described seeing Israeli tanks less than a kilometre away and said there had been strikes on an area just 500 metres (1,640ft) from the humanitarian zone.

The BBC has identified at least one area of damage approximately 500m away from the designated area of al-Mawasi since the IDF began directing people there.

The BBC has contacted Israeli forces, but has not received a response.

The IDF does claim that on 6 December Hamas ""launched a rocket from a humanitarian zone toward Israel"", and released a map with al-Mawasi marked.

The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.

International agencies have been voicing concerns about the viability of humanitarian zones in Gaza when fighting and air strikes extend across so much of the territory.

In mid-November the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the plan for al-Mawasi was ""a recipe for disaster"".

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink.""

The United Nations also has wider concerns about the plan.

""The situation in Gaza is catastrophic; no one and no place is safe,"" Andrea de Domenico, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) told the BBC.

""Safe zones declared unilaterally cannot protect civilians"", he added.","Al-Mawasi: Gaza humanitarian zone not humane, evacuees sayBy Merlyn Thomas and Ethar Shalaby BBC Verify and BBC ArabicFeras Al-ShaerAs Israel presses its military offensive across Gaza, the army has been repeatedly advising some two million civilians to move to a ""humanitarian zone"" smaller than London's Heathrow Airport.

Yael Noy (left) drives sick Palestinians, mostly children, across checkpoints to hospital appointments in Israel

Yael Noy doesn't wear military fatigues, but she describes herself as being in battle right now, after the Hamas assault on 7 October.

""I'm fighting to be good,"" she tells me. ""I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before.""

Yael heads a charity called Road to Recovery, a group of Israeli volunteers who drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel.

Or did.

The 1,000 or so volunteers can no longer take patients from Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. And four of them are dead - murdered as Palestinian gunmen stormed through their kibbutzim in southern Israel.

They include Vivian Silver, a renowned peace activist; Adi Dagan, who Yael describes as ""funny"" and always ready to step in and ferry patients at short notice in his big car; Tammy Suchman, a much-loved grandmother; and Eli Or-Gad, who loved talking about poetry.

Four other volunteers lost close family members on 7 October.

About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 17,177 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which followed.

Yael lives in northern Israel, but her parents are from kibbutz Alumim, one of the southern communities which was attacked - and they cowered as the assault unfolded, hour after terrifying hour.

Two of her nephews have been fighting in Gaza, in Israel's military response.

Yael Noy

Yael Noy's parents were in one of the kibbutzim attacked by Hamas on October 7 and are now displaced

In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, Yael says she was so shaken that she could barely breathe.

""Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again,"" she tells me.

But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her.

She and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel for cancer treatment, organ transplants and kidney dialysis. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and collect patients from Gaza again.

Yael refuses to dehumanise them, or equate them with Hamas, which is classed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.

""Like us they are victims of Hamas, so I think we should keep on helping them, because it's not their fault,"" she tells me over the phone.

""We can't refuse to help a child with cancer. Our neighbours need help, so we need to help them.""

She worries for the families she knows in Gaza, with winter approaching and so many bombed houses now uninhabitable.

The parent of a 6-year-old child, who'd had an organ transplant, texted one of the Road to Recovery volunteers saying simply: ""We are okay. We are going to die here.""

Anadolu Ajansi

After one week of truce, bombing over Gaza resumed on Friday

Yael is also desperately concerned for two Road to Recovery volunteers, Oded Lifschitz and Chaim Peri, who are still being held hostage by Hamas.

Emotionally, she feels like she's being torn apart. She has uncles and cousins who are adamantly opposed to what she's doing and accuse her of helping Hamas.

And it's not just family members who disapprove.

""When I'm driving with Palestinians through checkpoints in the West Bank, soldiers have asked me how I can do what I'm doing,"" she tells me. ""Other people ask the same question.""

""It's dangerous now to even talk about the suffering of the kids in Gaza - people look at me like I'm the enemy,"" she says, through sobs. ""But I'm not doing it for the Palestinians, I'm doing it because I want to be proud to be Israeli. I believe that whether you're an Israeli or a Palestinian, a Jew or an Arab, people are people.""

Some Palestinian families have reached out to find out how she is. But it's harder than ever now for those few people swimming against the tide by trying to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians.

""Even people on the left say that we should flatten Gaza. Both sides have become more and more radicalised,"" Yael says.

""I really don't know what will happen in the future. But I know that both of us will still live here, so we must find a solution.""

Since 7 October, some Road to Recovery volunteers have dropped out of driving altogether or decided to focus on taking medicines to displaced Israelis instead, while the war lasts.

But other volunteers have stepped in, to make sure that sick Palestinians from the West Bank still get to appointments that are saving their lives.

Yael says the charity will need support from the outside world to keep going because donations from within Israel have virtually stopped.

But she is sure that, when it becomes possible, Road to Recovery will be collecting child patients from Gaza again - hoping that they will all have survived.","'We can't stop' - the Israeli woman still helping sick PalestiniansBy Caroline Hawley BBC NewsAFPYael Noy (left) drives sick Palestinians, mostly children, across checkpoints to hospital appointments in IsraelYael Noy doesn't wear military fatigues, but she describes herself as being in battle right now, after the Hamas assault on 7 October.

Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah died in an apparent strike across the Israel-Lebanon border

Rights groups say Israel should be investigated for a possible war crime over the death of a journalist in Lebanon in October.

Reuters reporter Issam Abdallah, 37, died in two apparent strikes across the Israel-Lebanon border in October. Six others were wounded.

Amnesty and Human Rights Watch (HRW) said investigations showed the journalists were probably fired on deliberately by an Israeli tank crew.

Israel denies targeting the reporters.

""We do not target civilians,"" Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said when asked about the reports from Amnesty and HRW.

""We've been doing everything possible to get civilians out of harm's way,"" Eylon added in a televised briefing.

The group of seven journalists from Reuters, Al-Jazeera and AFP, were filming about 1km from the Lebanon-Israel border on 13 October.

Amnesty said images showed the journalists were wearing body armour marked with the word ""PRESS"", and the Reuters crew car was marked ""TV"" with yellow tape on its bonnet.

They were on a hilltop in an open area with no tree cover or other buildings to obscure them from nearby Israeli military outposts, Reuters said. Drones had been overhead and an Israeli helicopter had been patrolling, it said.

Abdallah was killed instantly in the strike. Two more Reuters journalists, two from AFP and two from Al Jazeera were all wounded. AFP photographer Christina Assi, 28, later had a leg amputated and is still in hospital.

AFP's Christina Assi had a leg amputated after the strike

Amnesty's deputy regional director Aya Majzoub said the organisation's investigation indicated it was ""likely a direct attack on civilians"" and should be ""investigated as a war crime"".

""Those responsible for Issam Abdallah's unlawful killing and the injuring of six other journalists must be held accountable,"" Majzoub added.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the strikes ""were apparently deliberate attacks on civilians, which is a war crime"".

The group said its investigation showed the journalists were ""well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit"".

Separately, Israel Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson Richard Hecht said the military did not target journalists when Reuters presented him with its own findings on the incident. The Israeli prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

AFP's global news director also said the agency had shared its latest findings with the Israeli military but had not received a response.","Issam Abdallah: Rights groups want Israel investigated over killed journalistBy Barbara Tasch BBC NewsReutersReuters journalist Issam Abdallah died in an apparent strike across the Israel-Lebanon borderRights groups say Israel should be investigated for a possible war crime over the death of a journalist in Lebanon in October.

BBC

Palestinians are mourning the death of well-known writer and literary scholar Refaat Alareer, who was killed in an air strike in Gaza City on Wednesday.

Alareer's father-in-law said he had died along with his brother and sister and four of her children.

He taught English literature at Gaza's Islamic University.

""My heart is broken, my friend and colleague Refaat Alareer was killed with his family,"" Gazan poet Mosab Abu Toha wrote on social media.

Alareer had declined to leave northern Gaza following the start of Israeli operations in the area. Two days before he died he posted video to social media in which a number of explosions could be heard.

""The building is shaking. The debris and shrapnel are hitting the walls and flying in the streets,"" he wrote.

In an interview with the BBC in the hours after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Alareer caused widespread offence by calling it ""legitimate and moral"". He said it was ""exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising"".

The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a revolt that took place in German-occupied Poland in 1943 and saw Jews use weapons smuggled into the ghetto to try to resist Nazi efforts to transport people to the extermination camps.

Alareer was one of the founders of ""We Are Not Numbers"", a Palestinian non-profit set up in 2015 that joined writers from around the world with young people in Gaza to ""tell the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news"".

He was the co-editor of the book, Gaza Unsilenced, and the editor of Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine.

Paying tribute on social media, former student Jehad Abusalim described Alareer as a mentor and friend who had ""truly cared about his students beyond the classroom"".

Alareer, he added, taught him English and viewed the language as a ""way to break free from Gaza's prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel's fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza"".

He was ""full of energy, life & humour. He loved Chicago Pizza, cats, history, classic music, theatre, poetry & Harry Potter,"" said Muhammad Shehada, a Gazan writer and communications chief at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor.

He was described as ""one of the kindest, most generous, committed, wonderful human beings I ever met"", by Palestinian-American author and activist Susan Abulhawa in a video posted on social media.

""Rest in peace, Refaat Alareer. We will continue to be guided by your wisdom, now and forever,"" Palestinian-American author and journalist Ramzy Baroud wrote.

In a poem posted on X, formerly Twitter, on 1 November, Alareer wrote: ""If I must die, let it bring hope, let it be a tale"". The post has been shared tens of thousands of times.

Israel destroyed the Islamic University at which Alareer taught on 11 October, saying it was an ""important Hamas operational, political and military centre in Gaza"".

Following the outcry over Alareer's interview in October, a BBC spokesperson said: ""We reported the Hamas attacks and the response by Israel in line with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines.

""We have included contributors who have condemned the attackers as terrorists and we have reported that Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments, including the UK.

""While an interviewee who made comments on the Warsaw Ghetto was robustly challenged on air, we agree his comments were offensive and we don't intend to use him again.""

In the 7 October attack, Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce at the end of November.

Hamas officials in Gaza say Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.","Refaat Alareer: Palestinians mourn writer killed in air strikeBBCPalestinians are mourning the death of well-known writer and literary scholar Refaat Alareer, who was killed in an air strike in Gaza City on Wednesday.

By Peter Shuttleworth BBC News

Brazilian legend Pele, arguably the world's greatest ever footballer, was a Viagra ambassador

Pele may have been its poster boy - and the Pope gave it his blessing - but if it wasn't for a south Wales industrial town, we may never have known about Viagra.

Men from Merthyr Tydfil, including ex steelworkers desperate for cash during the town's industrial decline, went to a local research centre to volunteer as medical guinea pigs.

Little did they know the trial they were agreeing to take part in helped change the world.

Because it wasn't until 30 years later that some of them discovered it laid the foundations for the drug that has since helped millions of men with erectile dysfunction.

At the start of the 1990s, drug company Pfizer was testing a compound called Sildenafil UK-92,480 in an effort to treat high blood pressure and angina.

It contracted medical studies out of a research house in Merthyr Tydfil and recruited local young men to test it.

Idris Price was one of the men who signed up to test the new drug in 1992.

At the time he was going from job to job having been laid off in the local steelworks.

""If I was short of money, I'd go down this place called Simbec,"" Idris said.

BBC / TWO RIVERS MEDIA

Idris Price says he and fellow volunteers in Merthyr Tydfil didn't know the angina drug they tested led to the creation of Viagra

He would ask what studies he could do for cash, adding: ""We were told nothing about the drug apart from the doctor said the tablet is for angina and you might have side effects.

""A lot of the boys were nervous about what was going to happen.""

The volunteers, all young men, were paid to take the compound UK-92,480 pill three times a day for 10 consecutive days.

""In the late 1980s and early 90s, it was very hard times for us and you'd try to get any money you could get,"" Idris told BBC documentary Keeping It Up.

""The money from the trial was very important to my family as we had nothing in those days.

""It allowed us to get in extra food and instead of having two bags of coal for the fire, we had five. It was actually a doddle, easy money which came in handy.""

But when the trial was over, unforeseen side effects from the drug proved the ""lightbulb moment"" for Pfizer.

How was Viagra discovered?

""Volunteers started coming forward and saying 'it's a little embarrassing, but I've noticed I'm getting more erections than usual - and the erections are a lot harder than usual',"" said Dr Pete Ellis, Pfzier's former discovery and development lead.

The chance observations in Merthyr Tydfil saw Pfizer put funding together to launch an impotence study.

Merthyr Tydfil is an industrial town in the south Wales valleys that was hit hard by the decline of heavy industry in the 1980s and 1990s

Patients with erectile dysfunction were tested at Bristol's Southmead Hospital, before a further clinical trial the following year in 1994 in Swansea.

The clinic at Swansea's Morriston Hospital was the widest spectrum as it included men with diabetes and heart disease, where the side effects can include erectile dysfunction.

""Pfizer said they had to be heterosexual men in a stable relationship,"" recalled trial leader and endocrinology consultant David Price.

""They were all regular guys, all married and ordinary blue collar Swansea men. The trial included showing the men erotic videos.""

BBC / TWO RIVERS MEDIA

David Price said his clinical trial of Viagra had a huge impact on his patients and their partners

A device was attached to the penis of the men to monitor the drug's impact and doctors reassured the men they wouldn't be interrupted.

The results from the Swansea trial, like the Bristol study, were positive.

Pfizer quickly realised they had a potentially game-changing drug on their hands.

In fact so positive were the results, several men refused to return their unused tablets.

Pfizer's marketing team then kicked into overdrive on how to land their message of this new pill as experts pondered whether it'd be seen by the public as ""extremely special or disastrous"".

The firm was concerned about launching what could be described as a sex drug into what they thought was a relatively conservative world - so they used the feedback from men on the trials as their marketing message.

Viewers can watch the big story of the little blue pill on BBC iPlayer and on BBC Two on Friday at 21:00 GMT.

""One idea from the research was how deeply impotence impacts a person's sense of self, the other was how much this impacted relationships,"" said Pfizer's former senior marketing manager Jennifer Doebler,

""I was deeply touched by what men were saying and how much this hurt relationships and how much it mattered to them.""

To boost their PR message that their possible impotence cure could repair struggling relationships, Pfizer got religious blessing from the Vatican by saying Viagra could help the institution of marriage and strengthen family values.

Viagra hit the shelves in the USA and UK in 1998 as the first approved oral treatment for erectile dysfunction in a blaze of publicity and quickly became the fastest selling drug in history with annual sales peaking in 2008 of almost $2bn.

But Idris, oblivious to the fact the side effects fellow volunteers reported helped create Viagra, was unaware of Merthyr's role in Viagra's story until researchers from Keeping It Up told him earlier this year.

The Russell T Davies' feature-length drama Men Up will be one of the BBC 's flagship shows over the festive period

The story of Viagra's origin in south Wales has been made into a feature-length drama Men Up, which counts Doctor Who and It's A Sin's Russell T Davies as an executive producer, and is to be broadcast on BBC One over Christmas.

""I was amazed when I found out,"" Idris said.

""Viagra is a big thing now... I'm glad it was found in Merthyr Tydfil.""

Viagra co-founder Dr David Brown said if it wasn't for the men of south Wales, Viagra may not exist.

""They made history,"" he said.

""They were probably just desperate to earn a bit of income but they've made a big difference to many people's lives and they should feel good about that.""

By Chloe Kim and Max Matza BBC News

Reuters

US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is facing a nine-count criminal indictment for alleged tax evasion.

The 56-page charge sheet accuses him of evading $1.4m in taxes from 2016-19 and funding an ""extravagant lifestyle"".

Much of the recovering crack cocaine addict's alleged illicit activities occurred while his father was US vice-president under Barack Obama.

But the current US president is not accused of wrongdoing, or even mentioned in the latest indictment.

The Yale-educated lawyer faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted. Hunter Biden was separately hit with a federal indictment on gun charges in September.

How Hunter Biden earned millions of dollars

The indictment outlines how Hunter Biden reaped a ""substantial income"" amounting to more than $7m between 2016-20.

The payments were mostly made to business accounts he had created for his company, Owasco, PC, and were also allegedly funnelled through a company called Skaneateles, in which he owned a 75% stake.

Chinese energy: For two years, beginning in late autumn of 2015, Hunter Biden was in a business relationship with CEFC China Energy, a Chinese energy conglomerate. In 2017, he was promised $1m stemming from a deal with a CEFC associate, State Energy HK, a Hong Kong business. Hunter Biden went on to do business with a Chinese equity fund.

Burisma: The president's son began working for Ukrainian private energy company Burisma Holdings Limited in April 2014, with a starting annual salary of $1m. In March 2017, his salary was reduced to around $500,000 per year. The charging document lists payments of $1,002,016 in 2016, $630,556 in 2017, $491,939 in 2018, and $160,207 in 2019. Hunter Biden had previously told the BBC he was hired to serve on the company's board because Burisma had seen his name ""as gold"".

Romanian businessperson: In autumn of 2015, Mr Biden ""entered into an oral agreement"" to help an unnamed ""Romanian businessperson… contest bribery charges he was facing in his home country"". For his work between November 2015 to May 2017, he and two other business associates split a payment of over $3.1m ""roughly"" between the three of them.

How Hunter Biden allegedly spent the money

The indictment says the president's son allegedly spent his money on ""drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes"".

His spending amounted to about $1m in 2016, $1.4m in 2017, $1.8m in 2018, and $600,000 in 2019, according to the charge sheet.

Between 2016-19, he withdrew $1.6m from cash machines alone.

In the same period he spent over $683,000 on ""payments - various women"", another $188,960 on ""adult entertainment"", $397,530 on clothing and accessories, and $237,496 on health, beauty and pharmacy, prosecutors say.

They list many of the luxury hotels Hunter Biden stayed in during the years that he chose to not maintain a residence. Most were in Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC.

He used the hotels ""for constant partying"", prosecutors say.

Other funds went to hire a Lamborghini, which he used after moving to the West Coast while waiting for his Porsche to be shipped to him.

Payments included $1,500 to an exotic dancer at a strip club, $11,500 for an ""escort"" who was paid ""to spend two nights with him"", $27,316 in payments to an online pornography website and $10,000 ""to purchase a membership in a sex club"".

Hunter Biden tells BBC News his father ""saved"" him several times when he was in a dark place with his addiction battle

How he allegedly evaded taxes

In order to avoid higher tax payments, prosecutors say that he claimed multiple personal expenses as business deductions.

Luxury car rentals and hotels were claimed as business ""travel, transportation and other"", according to the indictment.

He deducted academic tutoring for his daughter as ""legal professional and consulting"" and claimed payments to escorts and dancers as ""office and miscellaneous"".

In 2018 he directed a personal aide to ""place on payroll and provide healthcare benefits to three women with whom he had romantic or sexual relationships and a fourth woman who was related to one of those women"".

An Arkansas woman with whom he had a child was among those he hired.

While in the throes of a crack cocaine addiction, he ""claimed extensive business travel in 2018 when he had none"".

How prosecutors used his own words against him

Prosecutors say Hunter Biden's memoir, Beautiful Things, explicitly lays out what the indictment alleges - that he did not have numerous business dealings in 2018 and was instead spending his money on months-long drug and alcohol binges.

While working with California accountants in 2018, he claimed expenses, including $388,810 in business-related travel, despite writing in his book that the year was ""dominated by crack cocaine use 'twenty-four hours a day, smoking every fifteen minutes, seven days a week'"".

Prosecutors say if the accountants had known about the drug use, they would have more closely scrutinised ""his claims of hundreds of thousands of dollars in business expenses"".

From April 2018, and for the next few months, Hunter Biden surrounded himself with a crew of ""thieves, junkies, petty dealers, over-the-hill strippers, con artists, and assorted hangers-on"", he wrote in his memoir.

The luxury hotels cited in the indictment correspond with the ""very same hotels that the Defendant identified, by name, in his memoir as the locations of his monthslong drug and alcohol binge"", court documents say.

Hunter Biden recounts staying ""at the Sunset Tower, Sixty Beverly Hills, and the Hollywood Roosevelt"" and a list of other California hotels. He describes his entourage ""flashing fake Rolexes"" and bringing along ""their stripper girlfriends"".

""They'd drink up the entire minibar, call room service for filet mignon and a bottle of Dom Pérignon,"" reads part of the defendant's memoir, prosecutors note.","Hunter Biden's tax indictment: Drugs, escorts and girlfriendsBy Chloe Kim and Max Matza BBC NewsReutersUS President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is facing a nine-count criminal indictment for alleged tax evasion.

On this day in 1980, John Lennon was murdered outside his home in New York City, and ever since Beatles fans have speculated about what might have transpired with the band had he lived. A rediscovered 1975 interview with Lennon from the BBC archive gives some clues.

Beatle John Lennon met Mark Chapman – the man who was to kill him – twice on the day he died, 8 December 1980.

The first time was at around 5pm. Having finished a radio interview in their apartment in the Dakota building in New York to promote their new album, Double Fantasy, the musician and his artist wife Yoko Ono headed out on to the street. Mark Chapman approached Lennon to ask if he could sign a copy of the new LP. The album was later used as evidence in Chapman's trial, and reportedly went on to sell in a private auction for $1.5m in 2020.

Lennon, having signed it and posed for a picture with Chapman, jumped into a taxi with Ono to the recording studio to work on a new song called Walking on Thin Ice.

They returned home by car at around 10:30 pm. They had planned to go to a restaurant, but – according to a 2007 BBC interview with Ono – John was anxious to say goodnight to his younger son Sean before the five-year-old boy went to sleep. The couple stepped out of their vehicle, and began to walk towards the Dakota building, John carrying cassettes from the day’s recording session.

Mark Chapman was there waiting for him, holding a copy of JD Salinger's novel Catcher in the Rye and the LP that Lennon had signed for him hours earlier. As the musician walked past him, Chapman pulled out a handgun, and fired multiple times into his back.

The senselessness of the murder sent shockwaves of disbelief around the world. It is difficult to overstate the profound effect The Beatles had as a cultural phenomenon, and what they meant to people. They weren't merely pop stars. They changed the landscape of popular music. Their experiments with music, film, fashion, drugs and religion had been at the forefront of the 1960s, when the world seemed to be going through seismic changes. Their music had soundtracked a whole generation of people's lives, helping them to connect to what was going on around them and to each other.

Following the shooting, grief-stricken fans flocked to the Dakota building to leave flowers and cards. For days, radio stations played nothing but The Beatles and John Lennon songs. In his hometown of Liverpool, 30,000 people gathered to hold a 10-minute silence, as did more than 225,000 in Central Park, close to where he was shot dead.

A deeper significance

His music, which had meant so much to people during his life, took on an even deeper significance after his death. In the UK, the song (Just Like) Starting Over from the Double Fantasy album went to number one in the charts, only to be quickly knocked off the top spot by 1971's Imagine, which in turn was followed by Woman. His last record became a worldwide hit, and went on to win a Grammy for album of the year.

In the decades since, the one question that has haunted fans is this: if Lennon hadn't been killed that day, would the Beatles have eventually got back together to make more music?

In 1975, Lennon had already collaborated on songs with both George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and had rekindled his friendship with Paul McCartney

Five years before this death, in an episode of the BBC's music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, presenter Bob Harris asked former Beatle if there was any possibility of the Fab Four working together again and, more importantly, would it be a good idea?

By that point the Beatles had gone through a bruising break-up in 1970, following the fractious Let It Be recording sessions the year earlier. The animosity between the band members surrounding the split had often played out in public.

But in the years following that, the estrangement and creative difficulties between them had started to mellow. By the time of the BBC interview in 1975, Lennon had already collaborated on songs with both George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and had rekindled his friendship with Paul McCartney.

""You see, it's strange because at one period when they were asking me I'd say 'No, never, what the hell, go back? No, not me,' and then I came to a period where I thought why not? If we felt like making a record or doing something,"" he told Harris.

""I think over the period of being apart, we've all thought wouldn't it be nice, that wouldn't be bad. I've worked with Ringo and George but I haven't worked with Paul because we had a more difficult time but now we are pretty close.

""The other question is would it be worth it? That's answered by if we wanted to do it. If we wanted to do it then it would be worth it. If we got in the studio together and turned each other on again, then it would be worth it, sod the critics.""

His untimely death would rob the Beatles of that opportunity in person, but it wasn't the end of their musical collaboration together.

Watch John Lennon candidly answer: Will The Beatles ever reunite?

Fourteen years after his murder, his widow Ono gave a demo tape of songs that her late husband had written in 1978 – with the words ""For Paul"" written on it – to the remaining Beatles.

Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr built upon Lennon's original demo of his voice and piano, adding their own vocals and instrumentation to the tracks, resulting in the release of the first ""new"" Beatles singles since their break-up. First, Free as a Bird in 1995, and then Real Love in 1996.

Now and then

At the time, the band also attempted to record another track called Now And Then, but found that the quality of the recording was too poor to work with and, frustrated, abandoned the recording session.

It was when working with Peter Jackson on his archive documentary of those 1969 Let It Be recording sessions that the surviving Beatles, Paul and Ringo – George had died of cancer in 2001 – decided to revisit the song and try again.

Peter Jackson's documentary aimed to show that, despite the personal tensions between the Beatles members during those sessions, there were also plenty of examples of their tight-knit friendship, musical collaboration and creative harmony, especially when they were joking around or jamming together, which had been left out of the original 1970 documentary.

To improve the audio, the film company developed software that could separate out the jumbled up, overlapping sounds that were present in the documentary outtakes, allowing a more nuanced picture of the recording sessions to emerge.

This technology was used on the demo cassette that Ono had given the surviving Beatles in the 1990s, enabling them to distinguish and extract Lennon's voice from surrounding audio on the tape.

In 2022, Paul and Ringo returned to the studio to finish the track. As well as adding their instrumental parts and backing vocals to John’s voice, they also added the guitar parts recorded by George Harrison in their original attempt to finish the song in 1995. A new string arrangement by producer Giles Martin, son of The Beatles' original producer George Martin, helped complete the track.

The final song, Now and Then, was released this year, credited to all four Beatles. The poignant, contemplative piano ballad, with all four Beatles once again working in harmony, marks a fitting final chapter to John Lennon's remarkable musical legacy.

Agoprene

Celine Sandberg found that seaweed can be used to make foam for furniture

From crushed oyster shells to agricultural waste, Celine Sandberg has experimented with some wacky ingredients to make parts for furniture.

Her aim has been to cut the use of plastic polymers, known as polyurethane, in furniture making. That meant finding a more environmentally-friendly material to fill pillows, sofas and chair cushions.

To start with, the founder of Oslo-based Agoprene and her colleagues experimented with using oyster shells. The shells were ground into a powder and used to make a foamy material. Agricultural waste and wood fibres were experimented with in a similar way.

""We tried a bunch of different materials, but most of them turned out as rigid foam, not flexible,"" she says.

But eventually Ms Sandberg hit on seaweed, which her team transformed into a powder and baked in a special oven.

The process creates a foam block, soft enough to be used in seat cushions and chairs.

""The foam is 100% biodegradable. You can simply leave it in the soil, and it will naturally degrade over eight months - faster if you cut it into smaller pieces,"" says Ms Sandberg.

Agoprene is now looking to scale-up production by moving to a larger manufacturing facility in the coming year.

Can such innovation move furniture away from plastic, which is used in numerous ways in the furniture industry?

As well as polyurethane, which provides cushioning, the outside of soft furnishings might contain polyester - also part of the plastic family.

Faux leather furniture might use a vinyl blend, and vinyl is a convenient shorthand for a whole class of plastics. Meanwhile, cheaper wood furniture is often just a wood veneer stuck to plastic.

Industrially-produced wood furniture is often coated in a blend of chemicals, which may include polymers. That's what gives the wood that glossy, plastic-like appearance.

There are good reasons why plastic is so common, explains Christian Euler, an assistant professor in chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.

""It performs very well for its intended functions, and has a high degree of flexibility which allows it be soft or hard,"" he says.

""Also, because plastic's chemicals come from by-products from oil refining, it's cheap to make.""

But there are serious downsides to cheap, plastic-laden furniture. For a start, more and more of it is being thrown away.

The Environmental Protection Agency in the US estimates that 12 million tonnes of furniture was discarded in 2018, up from eight million tonnes in 2000.

Around 80% of that furniture discarded in 2018 in the US ended up in landfill, where the plastic parts could take hundreds of years to break down.

Meanwhile, making the plastic that goes into furniture involves carbon emissions. According to Agropene's calculations, polyurethane foam rubber accounts for a 105 million tonnes of CO2 emissions every year.

So numerous firms are looking for alternative materials.

Mater

Mater chairs contain discarded coffee bean shells

Danish design company Mater has produced a line of chairs that feature seats and backrests made from materials blended with either discarded coffee bean shells or sawdust from furniture production.

Its outdoor furniture is composed of ocean waste.

""We like mixing creativity with innovation,"" says chief executive Ketil Ardal.

""While it takes a lot of cash to manufacture these sustainable collections, and I get some grey hairs because of it, it's in our DNA to be a green company.""

Beyond seaweed and coffee shell waste, another unusual option researchers are hoping may replace plastic is fungus.

Mycellium, the root-like and branching structure of a fungus, is the foundation behind BioKnit, a new type of textile developed by researchers at Newcastle Upon Tyne's Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment (HBBE).

The process starts with mycelium grown on a substrate such as sawdust, says Jane Scott, lead of the HBBE's Living Textiles Group, and then it's placed in a dark and humid environment so it binds and absorbs nutrients from the sawdust. Then it dehydrates in an oven-like device.

She notes BioKnit is already being used by designers to make lampshades, for example.

Ms Scott says an advantage of this material is how it ""decomposes since it's bio-based and doesn't use any binders or glue that wouldn't decompose in a landfill.""

Major design brands are seeking to join smaller nimbler companies in ushering in sustainable materials into their furniture pieces. US kitchenware and home furnishings firm Williams Sonoma has said it's now using responsibly sourced cotton and recycled polyester, and IKEA plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by 2030.","The weird materials behind sustainable furnitureBy David Silverberg Technology reporterAgopreneCeline Sandberg found that seaweed can be used to make foam for furnitureFrom crushed oyster shells to agricultural waste, Celine Sandberg has experimented with some wacky ingredients to make parts for furniture.

By Nuala McGovern BBC Newshour presenter

Zhuang Xin-ran/BBC

The so-called God Flower is essential to the rituals of indigenous Taiwanese

In the misty mountains of Alishan in central Taiwan, there is a flower that is said to be a gateway to the gods.

The Dendrobium orchid, or golden grass orchid, grows in clumps of between 10 and 20 on glossy green canes. A yellow flower with a velvety orange-fringed centre, it is beautiful but odourless. To the indigenous Tsou people, it is known simply as the God Flower.

""My tribe has to have the God Flower for our ceremonies. Otherwise, God won't be able to find us,"" says tribal elder Gao Desheng.

It was once found in abundance, flowering outside Tsou homes. But now the Tsou venture ever deeper and higher into the mountainous forests surrounding them in search of it. Sometimes, they even scale trees to find the God Flower.

The tribe is convinced that climate change is to blame for this. The winter must be cold enough - below about 12C - for the buds to form, so they can bloom in the spring. The flowers mostly grow in warm temperate climates at altitudes of 800 to 1,800m (5,900ft).

However based on local temperature data from the Alishan Weather Station, the environmental group Greenpeace says that minimum temperatures in autumn and winter have gradually increased over the past 10 years.

It estimates that as a result of global warming, the average November temperature at the Alishan station will rise from the current 12-14C, to 14-16C by 2050.

Zhuang Xin-ran/BBC

Gao Desheng says the God Flower disappearing is inconceivable to him

As a whole, Taiwan has also been experiencing more frequent droughts and warmer weather.

While typhoons are destructive, they are a vital source of water for the island. So when they fail to make landfall, as has happened recently, crops can fail. This has affected not only the rituals of the Tsou, but their livelihoods as well.

Jui-Chiao Chung says her family has been planting bamboo for generations, but continuous droughts mean she has had to adapt what she farms. Without rains, the bamboo crop yield has dropped by more than half in recent years.

At her farm, yellowing stalks were visible in the distance, beyond the deep green coffee plants. They too belong to Ms Chung, who decided to farm coffee instead of bamboo to adapt to scant rainfall. But whatever steps she takes, it seems she is still one step behind.

Ms Chung says she has noticed the coffee beans are darker, an ominous sign of higher temperatures. One bad harvest means her income is reduced immediately. She is now thinking of growing a different crop to limit the effects of the changing climate.

But the Tsou people have no such solution for the vanishing God Flower.

If the flower can't be found or disappears, elder Gao says there is no substitute for it in their rituals. To him such a scenario is inconceivable. But he certainly fears the possibility. He points to a large urn containing the dry remnants of what was once a blossoming God Flower.

Among the Tsou's many deities is the war god Iafafeoi, a protector who is believed to ensure the safe return of young people from the battlefield.

""It is said that the God Flower surrounds the habitat of this deity,"" An Xiao-Ming, who is in his 40s, explained. ""These flowers are placed on the roofs of Kuba, signifying the presence of the divine.""

The Kuba, a thatched-roof hall which is the ceremonial and spiritual centre of their village, plays a central role in the three-day Mayasvi, a festival attended by hundreds.

Zhuang Xin-ran/BBC

Tsou people gather for the Mayasvi festival

The Tsou men will ask the deity of war to bless their warriors and ward off bad luck. To do this, they must pin the leaves of the golden orchid on their leather hats so that the gods can identify them as Tsou people.

Ancient tradition also dictates that the God Flower cannot be cultivated artificially - it must be found and picked in the wild before sunrise in the early morning, before important ceremonies can begin.

The Tsou tribe is one of 16 officially recognised indigenous tribes in Taiwan. They lived on the island for thousands of years before the majority Han Chinese arrived.

Today, they number around 6,000, out of a population of 23 million. They live mainly in the Alishan mountains, adjacent to the wild golden grass orchids.

Gao Desheng is concerned about the future for his tribe but he says it will depend on what support they get from the government. There is a presidential campaign currently under way and elder Gao said that politicians come and visit but they do not address the serious impact of climate change on the Tsou people's way of life.

Greenpeace agrees, calling the candidates ""climate snails"" - a dig at their lack of speed when it comes to developing sustainable environmental policies. The renewable energy goals put forward by the three main presidential candidates are not enough to meet net-zero emissions goals, despite climate change being a major concern for voters.","Taiwan: The 'God Flower' vanishing because of climate changeBy Nuala McGovern BBC Newshour presenterZhuang Xin-ran/BBCThe so-called God Flower is essential to the rituals of indigenous TaiwaneseIn the misty mountains of Alishan in central Taiwan, there is a flower that is said to be a gateway to the gods.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/67658531,Jon Rahm joins LIV Golf in seismic move that further fractures men's professional game,['Author not found'],"The innovation of LIV Golf persuaded Jon Rahm to join from the PGA Tour

Jon Rahm's move to LIV fundamentally shifts the landscape of men's professional golf - it is a seismic moment in the sport's so called 'civil war'.

The Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour could not have landed a bigger scalp than the Spaniard, who won the Masters last April and was unbeaten in helping inspire Europe to regain the Ryder Cup just weeks ago.

Rahm has international appeal. A Spanish matador who invokes the spirit of Seve Ballesteros in his tempestuous play; he is a European hero.

But he was schooled in the United States and proved a popular winner of the country's national championship when he made his major breakthrough by winning the 2021 US Open.

That universal appeal is invaluable to LIV and his switch to them leaves a gaping hole on the PGA Tour as well as potentially Europe's Ryder Cup team.

There will be huge pressure to alter the rules of eligibility for Luke Donald's side when they defend the trophy in New York in 2025. The Ryder Cup would be seriously devalued if a player of Rahm's stature is considered ineligible.

Under current rules, Rahm would be eligible to play in the next contest because he has signed his DP World Tour membership forms for the coming season. However, the eligibility criteria for the 2025 European Ryder Cup team will not be announced until next year, with the qualification period not beginning for at least another nine months.

American Brooks Koepka was the only LIV player to feature this year but fans will demand nothing less than the best of Europe against the best of the US going forward.

It was a handy coincidence that none of the Europeans playing on Greg Norman's circuit could mount an irresistible case for inclusion this year. That is highly unlikely in 2025 with Rahm now among their number.

More immediately, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the golf-mad governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which bankrolls LIV, now has a stacked hand as he faces off with the PGA Tour's Jay Monahan in their upcoming negotiations.

This is aimed at consolidating the 6 June 'framework agreement' aimed at bringing Saudi funds into the PGA and DP World Tours. This was supposed to signal peace between the establishment and the upstarts, but has yielded anything but.

Indeed, it was that top secret deal which ultimately prompted Rahm's move. Until then he was a PGA Tour loyalist, who held LIV and its 54-hole shotgun start format in barely disguised contempt.

Yes, he was friends with Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia who were among the first to cross the divide, but LIV was most certainly not for him. He spoke of ""fealty"" to the PGA Tour - the place where he wanted to make his own history.

But that loyalty evaporated with the controversial Saudi deal that none of the players saw coming. The arch loyalist suddenly started to speak of ""betrayal"" and from that moment Monahan and his management team needed to be on alert.

Nevertheless the notion of Rahm making this move still seemed pretty distant. He was signed up to Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy's TGL simulator league that was due to start early next year, so was still on the establishment side.

But last month he announced that he could not commit to TGL, which then suffered a structural collapse to its prototype stadium in Florida, delaying the project by a year. The roof falling in.

It was a portent to rumours that Rahm was off. They first surfaced at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai just over a fortnight ago and gathered momentum until the dam burst with Thursday's confirmation.

It leaves the sport deeply fractured. It could be argued that the best five golfers in the world are Scottie Scheffler, McIlroy, Rahm, Cam Smith and Brooks Koepka.

There is no point in consulting the Official World Golf Rankings because they have been utterly compromised by LIV's arrival - their 14-tournament circuit receives no recognition from the now outdated OWGR.

Of that unofficial top five, Scheffler and McIlroy are the only non-LIV players. The sport is split down the middle and LIV has growing credibility.

McIlroy is desperate to find a way to reunite the game, but has resigned from the PGA Tour's board. Woods is the key voice around that now player majority table and his antipathy towards Saudi Arabia is well known.

Indeed, the 15-times major champion turned down a package nearing the billion dollar mark in the early days of LIV's incarnation. Woods has to be persuaded that Saudi involvement needs to be part of the PGA Tour's future.

Without it there will be no peace, no unification and men's professional golf outside the majors will be disparate and diluted. LIV is clearly well placed to pick off more and more big names and rumours are already starting to fly.

Unless a deal is done, and the 31 December deadline is fast approaching, we are left with pro golf headed towards the mish-mashed divided landscape of professional boxing.

""With this crossroads in the sport, I see a lot of similarities between men's golf and boxing,"" leading sports lawyer John Nucci posted on X.

The legal expert observed how boxing's popularity has suffered with so many different governing bodies. ""This has led to scheduling conflicts, diluted talent pools and the turn off of fans.""

Geo-politically, concerns over Saudi Arabian sport washing were brushed aside when the PGA Tour signed the 'framework agreement' last June. There was no longer any moral high ground for the loyalists.

I remember asking Rahm if had any qualms over Saudi Arabia's human rights record when he was defending champion at the 2022 US Open. ""I am not going to get into politics,"" he flat batted.

What is clear, though, is that money talks. Even for a player who has amassed around $75m in winnings well before his 30th birthday.

This deal is arguably the biggest individual contract in sporting history, especially if add ons from team ownership and sponsorships come to fruition. And, don't forget he will be playing $20m events every time he tees it up.

But this is pro sport. Money always talks the loudest in this greed driven environment and Rahm's move offers further proof.","The innovation of LIV Golf persuaded Jon Rahm to join from the PGA TourJon Rahm's move to LIV fundamentally shifts the landscape of men's professional golf - it is a seismic moment in the sport's so called 'civil war'.

From The Last of Us and Succession, to Fellow Travelers and The Bear, Caryn James and Hugh Montgomery pick the year's greatest programmes to watch and stream right now.

HBO/Sky

1. The Last of Us

Just when it seemed there wasn't room for one more post-apocalyptic drama or video-game adaptation, The Last of Us came along. The story involves terrifying mushroom-headed zombies, but they are the least of the reasons for the show's impact. The series brings deep humanity and emotion to its tense survival story, centred on the relationship between Joel (Pedro Pascal), a bereaved father, and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), the orphaned girl he reluctantly agrees to take cross-country to safety. As they travel west across what was once the US, the changing landscape and characters they encounter add range and variety. An episode starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett whose relationship endures over the decades after the apocalypse is already one of the year's most poignant. A meeting with Joel's lost brother is satisfying yet fraught with loss by the end. Pascal has achieved a well-deserved mainstream breakout with the role, as he grounds the genre elements with a powerful, realistic performance, earning him an Emmy nomination. The Last of Us speaks eloquently to people who never knew it was a video game in the first place. (CJ)

Sometimes a concept for a show is just so inspired, there's simply no way it can fail. Such is the case with this murder-of-the-week series from Knives Out creator Rian Johnson, which came about in the first place following of a casual dinner conversation between him and star Natasha Lyonne about their love of detective shows. One of Hollywood's most inimitable stars, Lyonne is an absolute dream here as the insouciant Charlie, a cocktail waitress on the run who finds herself travelling around the US, inadvertently getting involved in murder cases that could do with her mental acuity and unique ability to detect when someone's lying. She is, in her scrappy, wisecracking energy, a female Columbo; and as with that classic series, we see the murder at the beginning of each episode – so that it's not a whodunnit, but a howdunnit. And there is something singularly soothing about watching Lyonne put the pieces of the puzzle together, before hitting the road once more. True episodic TV of the old school, it is one of the year's simplest and purest pleasures. (HM)

3. Shrinking

Harrison Ford, in unlikely but brilliant comic mode, would be reason enough to watch this series, but Shrinking does something unexpected, and challenging to pull off. It balances a heartfelt dramatic tone in a story of grief with very funny, character-based humour. Jason Segel, also one of the series' creators (along with Ted Lasso's Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein), plays Jimmy, endearing but at times useless therapist. A year after his wife died, he decides to tell his patients how to run their lives. Much of the wit comes from the way his colleagues try to save him from himself; Ford brings perfect deadpan delivery to the role of senior therapist who is also Jimmy's irascible friend and mentor. Jessica Williams is another colleague, and together, she and Ford can make a disagreement about how much water to drink in a day a comic delight. As the characters reveal more and more flaws, they also become more likable in all their imperfections. (CJ)

4. Succession

In its fourth and final season, the penetrating saga of money, power and family dysfunction lived up to its grand ambitions, scooping 27 Emmy nominations. The episode in which Logan Roy (Brian Cox, creating an indelible character) dies is an artistic gem in itself, focused not on the dying man but his distant, distraught children, brought to life by Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin with unsettling depth. In the end, the question of which Roy child would succeed their father to lead the Waystar Royco media empire was answered in a surprising way, emphasising the idea that no one holds power forever. Succession's portrait of greed and the changing media landscape is unrivalled, but creator Jesse Armstrong's most brilliant move was to embody it all in one broken family. Succession holds a secure place among the best series of all time. (CJ)

5. Beef

If this Netflix show was sold as a ""road rage drama"", then the moment at which LA residents Amy (Ali Wong) and Danny (Steven Yeun) clash in a car park is really just a starting point for a darkly funny series in which events spiral out of control in unexpected ways, as their lives become evermore intertwined. For those who are yet to catch it, it wouldn't do to give too much more away about what happens, except to say the social satire of the earlier episodes doesn't prepare you for some moments both gruesome and surreal later on. Wong and Yeun are both astounding, from different sides of the class divide but equally highly-strung, and are backed by a superb ensemble of supporting actors, from Maria Bello as a Gwyneth Paltrow-esque lifestyle entrepreneur to Young Mazino as Danny's sweet, himbo younger brother Paul. At a time when Netflix has been cutting back on genuinely bold and subversive content, this stands out as a rare gem. (HM)

6. Dead Ringers

In both her role choices and screen presence, Rachel Weisz is consistently one of our most compelling stars – so to get two of her for the price of one in this adaptation of David Cronenberg's 1980s film of the same name about identical twin gynaecologists is a treat indeed. And boy, does Weisz make the most of her dual roles: as the shy, upstanding Beverly and the decadent, unruly Elliot, joint founders of a state-of-the-art birthing centre, she offers a masterclass in contrasts, while attacking the latter character with particular relish. In fact, this whole reimagination of the source material is inspired, from Alice Birch's caustically funny, scalpel-sharp script to the stunning cinematography and a memorable supporting performance from Jennifer Ehle as an amoral billionaire funder who makes Succession's Roy family look like the Brady Bunch. Altogether, it makes for a darkly alluring psychological thriller that is certainly among the best and most daring drama series that Amazon has ever produced. (HM)

7. The Diplomat

One of the smartest political thrillers in years, this timely series combines international intrigue, suspense and even car bombs with personal drama. Keri Russell bristles with no-nonsense energy as a career US diplomat who suddenly finds herself ambassador to the UK. She lands in the middle of behind-the-scenes wrangling about terrorism and who to blame for the bombing of a British ship, providing more stresses and strains to the backdrop of her crumbling marriage. Rufus Sewell is all charm as her unreliable diplomat husband, who has ambitions of his own. Their scenes together are models of grown-up drama, as their relationship depends on political optics as well as emotions. The Diplomat's creator, Debora Cahn, was a writer on The West Wing, but this bracingly fresh series has none of that show’s gushy patriotism. Its sharp view of politics, bordering on cynical, is perfectly suited to the world today – and packed with twists and explosions, it's also exhilarating to watch. (CJ)

8. Happy Valley

TV cops are 10 a penny, but none feels quite so real as Catherine Cawood, the simultaneously indomitable and fragile northern English policewoman played by Sarah Lancashire in Sally Wainwright's scintillating procedural, which came to an end with a belter of a third series. Seven years on from the last run, the story picks up with Catherine having trouble with her now teenage grandson Ryan – and his dad, the evil criminal Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), banged up in prison. But for how much longer? As ever, what Wainwright does so masterfully is balance the suspense of the plot with a lived-in portrait of the small Yorkshire town, Hebden Bridge, where it’s set. And at its heart, Lancashire is simply electric, as a person fighting to keep her family and community safe, who you absolutely would not want to cross. (HM)

9. Silo

Apple TV+ has become perhaps the most consistently quality streamer of late, and here is another great new series: a dystopian sci-fi show, based on the books by author Hugh Howey. Set in the future, it finds humankind retreated to a big underground silo to live as the world outside becomes apparently uninhabitable. But its residents are kept in the dark as to exactly what happened to drive them there and more besides – until various people, including Sheriff Holston (David Oyelowo) and engineer Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson) begin to get suspicious about the whole regime and the lies it might be telling. The whole thing is beautifully conceived, from the production design of the shut-off, concrete world to the intriguing plotting. As John Nugent in Empire magazine says: ""it is a riveting puzzle-box mystery of a series, which across its 10 episodes borrows elements of Swiftian satire, chilly Cold War-era political conspiracies, dusty small-town Western showdowns, doing-the-work police procedurals, and even philosophical thought experiments."" And if that doesn’t entice you, what will? (HM)

10. The Bear

The Bear made an audacious move in its second season, as chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) closed the sandwich joint The Beef and went about replacing it with an upscale restaurant, The Bear. That risk played out across the entire dynamic season, which slowed down the kitchen intensity and instead offered deeper dives into the characters' lives and pasts. A highlight is the Christmas Eve episode, a flashback featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as Donna, Carmy and Sugar's (Abby Elliott) emotionally troubled mother, who prepares the family dinner with a chaotic energy that mirrors her son's. Cousin Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) has his own stellar episode and learning curve when he spends a week working at a Michelin-level restaurant. Carmy falls in love, and it's a sign of the show's strength that we're disappointed but not surprised when the relationship goes wrong. Along with its kitchen scenes and dishes from food-stylist heaven, The Bear presents its engaging, confused, multi-layered characters from the inside out. (CJ)

11. Dark Winds

Zahn McClarnon makes Lt Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police one of television's most intriguing and complicated heroes, more than ever in the second season of this thrilling, atmospheric series set in 1970's New Mexico. When Leaphorn – calm, terse but big-hearted – discovers who was behind the deliberate explosion that killed his son, he grapples with the line between justice and vengeance. McClarnon thoroughly engages us in the moral decision that might go either way. The show also combines a taut detective story with Western action as Leaphorn tracks a serial killer across the desert landscape. In lively subplots, with a largely Native American cast, Leaphorn's sergeant, Bernadette Manuelito (Jessica Matten) is conflicted about her future, and his former partner, Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon) is a private investigator, adding a trace of comedy with his garish 1970s wardrobe.

12. The Other Black Girl

Zakiya Dalila Harris's 2021 novel about two young black editorial assistants at a cutthroat New York publishing company was turned into a dynamic Hulu series, developed by Harris and Rashida Jones, who enhanced the novel's drama. The story centres on Nella (Sinclair Daniel), thoughtful, smart but a bit too trusting, who is unsettled by the arrival of Hazel (Ashleigh Murray), whom she welcomes as another black woman, but who might have sinister motives. The increasingly mysterious plot involves conspiracies, stalking, betrayals and secrets about one of Nella's all-time-favourite authors, and eventually brings in a haunting touch of the supernatural. But the true horror is the workplace, with everyday competitiveness heightened for Nella by racism and sexism, which this entertaining show handles with a deft but piercing touch. (CJ)

13. The Curse

Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie created and star, along with Emma Stone, in this inventive comic drama that combines the mordant wit of Fielder's series The Rehearsal, the convincingly jaundiced world view of Safdie's Uncut Gems (written and directed with his brother, Josh), and the audacity of Stone's recent acting roles, notably as the reanimated heroine of this year's Poor Things. On paper the series could sound like a tame satire of reality television, with Fielder and Stone as a married couple on a home improvement show and Safdie as their self-involved producer. But the many twists, which include a curse by a young girl, gentrification that will harm the local Indigenous residents, and the couple's fertility problems, add challenging layers, all shaped by three original yet perfectly meshed voices that consistently avoid the predictable.

14. Slow Horses

A smart, entertaining spy caper from the start, this series has only got better over its three seasons. The clever concept is based on Mick Herron's series of novels: MI5 agents, disgraced and out of favour – sometimes because they disobeyed orders, for a noble reason, and sometimes because they just messed up ­– are exiled to a backwater in Slough House, hence the name Slow Horses. But the show soars beyond its premise thanks to a cast that finds that perfect line between wit, drama and suspenseful action. Gary Oldman, as Jackson Lamb, the shambolic head of Slough House, has come to reveal the wounded soul and conscience beneath his character's acerbic, hard-drinking surface. Jack Lowden (who really should be a bigger star) is the charismatic, energetic yet occasionally gullible agent River Cartwright. And Kristin Scott Thomas is the sophisticated head of MI5, who begrudgingly puts up with the Slow Horses, yet must know how brilliant they are. The show's own glittering brilliance is unmistakable.

15. Top Boy

Few recent TV dramas have felt as consistently essential as this hard-hitting British show about drug gangs in East London, which originally premiered on the UK network Channel 4 back in 2013 before being rescued from cancellation by rap superstar Drake, who picked it up and shopped it to Netflix, where it really flourished. It's sad, then, that this year's third series on the streaming platform marked its end, although it certainly ended with a bang, as luck ran out for anti-hero Dushane, leading to a devastating final encounter with his former friend Sully. The series has often been compared to The Wire, which has always seemed off-the-mark – for where the former is novelistic and discursive, it's a much pulpier product, constantly propelling things forward via brazen twists and turns. Which was in no way a bad thing: it was a scintillating exercise in narrative tension, right up to the shocking – and controversial – ending. (HM)

16. Dreaming Whilst Black

From Girls to Ramy, the last decade has seen a rich vein of semi-autobiographical comedy-dramas emerge thriving off sharp cultural observation and a sense of real authenticity. This British offering is the latest show to join that fine lineage: the work of Anglo-Jamaican actor-writer-director Adjani Salmon, it channels his and his friends' struggles starting out in film and TV into a hilarious, penetrating portrait of black British experience. He stars as Kwabena, an aspiring London filmmaker burdened by money troubles, dead-end jobs and the casual racism of the industry. Alongside him, we see in a parallel plotline his best friend Amy (Dani Moseley) struggling in a film company where she is similarly subject to all kinds of microaggressions. The really masterful thing about Salmon's creation is its tone: simultaneously, it manages to be both warmly engaging and brilliantly, righteously caustic. May it return for a second run soon enough.

17. Colin from Accounts

About five to 10 years ago, there was a lot of talk about the demise of the rom-com, but such notices were premature: romance isn't dead, it turned out, it just migrated to the small screen, from the succession of frothy feature films on Netflix to sharply written episodic series like Love Life and Starstruck. The latest addition to the latter camp was this totally charming Australian offering, which was beguilingly straightforward, its success resting not on any high concept but simply getting the basic rom-com ingredients right: good jokes, two leads with real chemistry, and a cute animal thrown in for good measure. The series stars real-life couple Harriet Dyer and Patrick Brammall as Ashley and Gordon, who meet in unfortunate circumstances after a car accident in which a dog is hit, that they then guiltily decide to take joint responsibility for. And so it is that attraction blossoms, despite their neuroses and further complications caused by friends, colleagues, exes and parents. It's such a pleasure to see a show so unassuming, self-assured and effortless all at once: this was certainly the easiest watch of the year. (HM)

18. Fellow Travelers

In a lean autumn for TV, this eight-part drama stood out as an archetypal example of ""prestige drama"" with a twist. Telling the era-spanning story of the turbulent, furtive affair between two men, played by Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey, who meet as political aides in 1950s Washington DC, it on the one hand feels comparable to many other stately, glossy historical miniseries that have preceded it. And on the other, when it comes to its depiction of its central duo, it feels genuinely progressive, with sex scenes between them that are as bracingly candid as they are important to delineating the characters' relationship. As for the bigger picture it paints, the early episodes, in particular, provide a chilling and illuminating account of the gay witch hunts of the McCarthy era, while a sub-plot about the relationship between a black journalist (Jelani Alladin) and his drag queen lover (Noah J Ricketts) explores further intersections of prejudice to powerful effect. Educational but full-blooded in emotion, it hits the spots it's evidently aiming for. (HM)

By Mike Wendling BBC News

Getty Images

Vivek Ramaswamy shared a series of fringe theories at the last Republican debate.

The biotech entrepreneur listed off ideas that are more typically found on far-right message boards, rather than presidential debate stages.

""Why am I the only person on the stage at least who can say that [the Capitol riot on] January 6th now does look like it was an inside job?"" he asked.

That was only the first controversial and unsubstantiated theory he shared Wednesday night.

""The 'great replacement' theory is not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory, but a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform,"" he contended.

And: ""The 2020 election was indeed stolen by Big Tech.""

It is unclear what Mr Ramaswamy meant by some of these statements, but some of the phrases he used have a more specific and notorious meaning.

""Great replacement"" is a far-right theory that states that a cabal of people - often named as ""globalists"", ""elites"" or Jews - is deliberately plotting to change the demographics of Western countries. The theory alleges this is being done through immigration, interracial marriage, reducing the birth rate and other means.

It is a version of the ""white genocide"" conspiracy theory which alleges that there is a plot to entirely ""eliminate"" the white race. That idea has been mentioned in documents left behind by several racially motivated attackers, including mass shooters in Christchurch, New Zealand, El Paso, Texas, and Buffalo, New York.

Whether Mr Ramaswamy knew that background is unclear. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Following the debate, however, the unorthodox candidate reposted a message from a popular white nationalist account on X and commented that ""the left"" was ""intentionally facilitating mass illegal migration"".

Capitol riot misinformation

Mr Ramaswamy's contention that federal authorities somehow planned or executed the Capitol riot is a mainstay of far-right spaces online, despite proof that Donald Trump's supporters were energised by the former president's rhetoric and mistruths of a ""stolen"" election on 6 January.

After the debate, Mr Ramaswamy toyed with the idea further.

In a CNN interview and on X, formerly Twitter, he temporarily toned down his message to the claim that ""there was at the very least entrapment of peaceful protesters"".

But later he doubled down again, alleging on social media that the riot was somehow orchestrated by ""the deep state"" - or some other form of the US government.

This is not the first time that Mr Ramaswamy delved into this kind of conspiratorial thinking.

Earlier this year he brought up 9/11 conspiracy theories in an interview with The Atlantic magazine and said: ""I think it is legitimate to say, how many police, how many federal agents were on the planes that hit the Twin Towers?""

He later focused his criticism on US government secrecy, particularly about the alleged role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. He mentioned that theory again at the debate as well.

X/Vivek Ramaswamy

The Republican candidate invited noted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones onto his podcast.

Why now?

Mr Ramaswamy's statements during Wednesday's debate won him the support of a number of influential characters on the far right, who see any attention as an advancement of their cause. That could explain his rhetoric.

Cynthia Wang, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and an expert in conspiratorial beliefs, says that Mr Ramaswamy's turn towards conspiratorial thinking is an expected development in the current political climate.

""He might actually believe in these theories, but there is also a benefit in using them, because it helps people - his potential supporters - make sense of the world,"" she says. ""Using this powerful language is actually very attractive for people during uncertain times… More rational explanations don't have the same punch.""

Mike Rothschild, a journalist and author of the book Jewish Space Lasers: The Rothschilds and 200 Years of Conspiracy Theories, says that Mr Ramaswamy - who enjoyed a sudden spike in presidential polling before stalling in recent months - is looking beyond the current campaign.

""He knows the clock is running out on his presidential campaign, but it's just starting on a bigger career in media that revolves around building a fanbase that believes in conspiracy theories,"" he says.

Mr Ramaswamy has used his own campaign podcast to cultivate that specific fanbase. He recently invited conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars for an hour-long chat and expressed sympathy for Mr Jones over his loss of a defamation lawsuit brought by Sandy Hook school shooting victims.

Ms Wang says Mr Ramaswamy has little to lose by bringing up fringe ideas in a race where the frontrunner - Mr Trump - is himself prone to repeating conspiracy theories.

""I can see this as a Hail Mary, but if it doesn't work and he does lose, he's still supporting the overall cause in the Republican Party,"" she says, ""because a lot of what he is saying aligns with what Trump is saying.""","Why is Vivek Ramaswamy doubling down on conspiracy theories?

Shane MacGowan has been hailed as a poet, lyricist, singer and trailblazer at his funeral ceremony in County Tipperary.

The acclaimed songwriter and lead singer of The Pogues died last week aged 65.

Hundreds of people gathered inside and outside the church in Nenagh to say their farewells.

Some of his famous friends took part in the ceremony including Nick Cave, Johnny Depp, and Bob Geldof.

Irish President Michael D Higgins was among the guests at the Saint Mary of the Rosary Church in Nenagh.

Fittingly, music played a huge part in the ceremony and the mood was celebratory rather than sad.

Mourners danced in the church as host of Irish musicians played Fairytale of New York.

""I think Shane would have enjoyed that, that's some send off for my brother,"" Siobhan MacGowan told the congregation.

In her eulogy, his widow Victoria Mary Clarke described him as ""a genius and a beautiful soul"".

Parish priest and keen rock music fan Fr Pat Gilbert delivered the homily, describing MacGowan as ""our modern-day bard"".

""A poet, lyricist, singer, trailblazer, Shane reflected life as lived in our time, calling out accepted norms that oftentimes appear unacceptable,"" he said.

MacGowan, who is best known for his Christmas song Fairytale of New York, would have celebrated his 66th birthday on Christmas Day.

""Born on the birthday of Jesus and passing on the same days as Oscar Wilde and Patrick Kavanagh, and his funeral celebration Mass today on this great Feast of Mary and Sinead's [O'Connor] birthday, all seems right,"" Fr Gilbert told mourners.

MacGowan had been unwell for some time before his death last week.

His most recent home was in Dublin but his funeral ceremony is being held 160 km (100 miles) away in Tipperary, near where he spent part of his childhood.

Nick Cave, who arrived a little late, performed one of MacGowan's best known songs, A Rainy Night in Soho.

Imelda May and Hothouse Flowers frontman Liam Ó Maonlaí led a rendition of MacGowan's ballad You're The One.

Irish singers Mundy and Camille O'Sullivan sang ""Haunted"" - a duet that MacGowan recorded with the late Sinead O'Connor who died earlier this year.

The musical performances were organised by Oscar-winning songwriter Glen Hansard, frontman of The Frames.

The actor Aidan Gillen and former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams were among the readers in the church.

U2 leader singer Bono was not able to attend in person but he sent recorded reading for the funeral.

Singer Nick Cave performed during the ceremony

His widow recalled first meeting him when she was 16 and how they became a couple when she was 20.

""I think I fell in love with his soul,"" Ms Clarke said.

She also spoke candidly about how drug-taking was a huge factor in his life, with people telling her for decades that ""he would be dead within six months"".

""His physical body lasted a very long time, considering what he did to it,"" she said.

But she hailed his talent and creativity, calling him a ""brilliant artist"" who ""reinvented Irish music"".

During the offertory procession a number of gifts were brought to the altar, each chosen to represent aspects of the singer's life.

The gifts included a vinyl copy of the album Led Zeppelin II, a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) shirt and a copy of MacGowan's book Crock of Gold.

His former bandmates from The Pogues sang The Parting Glass towards the end of the service.

Dublin's adopted son

Earlier, fans thronged the streets of Dublin to say their farewells as his funeral procession travelled through the Irish capital.

Dublin was blanketed in a thick layer of cloud as the city paid tribute to its Kent-born adopted son.

It was probably fitting as weather was a theme of MacGowan's lyrics - you can't have that night in Soho without the rain, the morning light at Albert Bridge without the mist.

He was Irish after all.

'Shane was a poet'

The Pogues had international fame and many fans travelled from far afield to say their goodbyes.

Bruno and Pascal Kenard came all the way from Nantes, in France, to attend the procession.

""Shane was a poet. I think I know all his songs,"" Bruno said.

""There are lots of emotions today,"" he added. ""The band playing, the singing - have to say it broke my heart.""

At Tower Records in Dublin city centre, Pogues albums and merchandise have nearly sold out since his death.

Gerard O'Boyle said there was a great buzz around live gigs involving MacGowan

""It was the same when Sinéad (O'Connor) died, there was a tremendous interest in everything,"" said Gerard O'Boyle, who works in the store.

""Some people are quite frantic to get it. We've had people on the phone wanting Haunted (MacGowan's duet with O'Connor) but it's hard to get.""

His band The Gorehounds supported the band during their 1980s heyday.

""They were brilliant, it was a great night. The records are good but live - that was where the buzz was.""

https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/67663582,Paris 2024 Olympics: Russian and Belarusian athletes allowed to compete as neutrals,['Author not found'],"Russian and Belarusian athletes who have qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics will be allowed to participate as neutrals, the International Olympic Committee has confirmed.

The conditions of their inclusion include competing without flags, emblems or anthems of their country.

Athletes from those nations were banned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Letting individuals take part was about ""respecting human rights"" the IOC said.

However, World Athletics said its position remains unchanged, with athletes, support personnel and officials from Russia and Belarus remaining excluded ""from all World Athletics Series events"".

""You may well see some neutral athletes from Russia and Belarus in Paris, it just won't be in athletics,"" World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said on Friday.

Speaking at the World Athletics Council Meeting in Monaco, Coe added: ""We have a fixed position. I think it is right that International Federations should make judgements that they feel is in the best interest of their sport. That is what our council has done.""

Ukraine had threatened to boycott the 2024 Games if the ban was not upheld but Ukraine's sports minister Vadym Huttsait told Reuters in July it could drop that threat if Russian and Belarusian athletes were made to compete under a neutral flag.

The IOC's decision comes after Olympic sports federations asked for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be allowed to compete as neutrals in Paris earlier this week.

""The executive board of the IOC has decided that individual neutral athletes (AINs) who have qualified through the existing qualification systems of the International Federations on the field of play will be declared eligible to compete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in accordance with the conditions outlined,"" the Olympic body said on Friday.

""AINs are athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport. The strict eligibility conditions based on the recommendations issued by the IOC executive board on 28 March 2023 for international federations and international sports event organisers will be applied.""

Paris 2024 organisers said they were ""taking note"" of the IOC's decision and reiterated that qualification for the Games ""falls under the responsibility of the IOC and the International Federations"".

""Paris 2024's responsibility is to host athletes who have qualified for the Games under the best possible conditions, regardless of their nationality,"" organisers said.","Russian and Belarusian athletes who have qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics will be allowed to participate as neutrals, the International Olympic Committee has confirmed.
However, World Athletics said its position remains unchanged, with athletes, support personnel and officials from Russia and Belarus remaining excluded ""from all World Athletics Series events"".
""You may well see some neutral athletes from Russia and Belarus in Paris, it just won't be in athletics,"" World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said on Friday.
I think it is right that International Federations should make judgements that they feel is in the best interest of their sport.
The IOC's decision comes after Olympic sports federations asked for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be allowed to compete as neutrals in Paris earlier this week."

Gérard Depardieu has made more than 200 films and is France's best-known actor

France's best-known actor Gérard Depardieu is under new pressure following a TV documentary showing him making obscene remarks about women.

The programme, broadcast on Thursday, portrays the 74-year-old star as sex-obsessed while on a shoot in North Korea in 2018.

In footage apparently taken of the documentary's ""making of"", the actor repeatedly embarrasses his female interpreter with comments such as: ""I weigh 124 kilos. Without an erection. With an erection, I'm 126 kilos.""

On another occasion he says in front of her: ""I have a girder in my underpants.""

He is also seen at a riding stable making sexual comments about why he claims women enjoy going on horseback.

The programme - part of the Complément d'Enquête (Further Investigation) series on France 2 - uses the material to back up allegations of Depardieu's sexual misconduct made recently by a number of women in the film industry.

Depardieu was placed under judicial investigation on suspicion of rape and sexual assault in 2020, after a complaint made by actress Charlotte Arnould.

He denies the allegation, saying their sexual contact was consensual. Police initially dropped the charge because of a lack of evidence of rape. But on appeal it was re-opened, with Arnould alleging she was under his emotional ""control"".

A second case was opened three months ago, when actress Hélène Darras accused Depardieu of groping her in 2007 while on a shoot for the film Disco. The prosecutor's office said the case may be dropped because the events were too long ago.

In Thursday's television documentary, other women spoke of a sexualized ambience whenever Depardieu was on set, and of being the target of his innuendo.

They said that a kind of silence prevailed because of his status, which meant he was never checked.

Born in Châteauroux in central France in 1948, Depardieu had a troubled childhood before coming to Paris and being discovered as an actor in the early 1970s.

He has made more than 200 films, and been seen by more French cinema-goers than any other actor apart from Louis de Funès.

The France 2 documentary also investigated the allegation - originally made by Depardieu himself - that as a boy as young as nine he had taken part in ""rapes"" in Châteauroux.

The claim was first made by the actor in an interview in 1978, then repeated to Time magazine in 1991 when Depardieu was in the running for an Oscar for his film Cyrano de Bergerac.

It was reported in France at the time that the Time profile helped tip the Oscars jury against him.

Two childhood friends of Depardieu confirmed that he was regarded in the 1950s as a légèr voyou (minor hooligan), and that non-consensual sex at the time was common.

But Depardieu's brother Alain said: ""He told so many stories. He built up a legend - or maybe we did it for him - which made him out to be a much greater delinquent than he actually was.""

Feminists have had Depardieu in their sights for several years, since the MeToo movement began to gather momentum.

In April, 13 women - some anonymous - were quoted in an online investigation by Médiapart accusing him of inappropriate behaviour. Activists forced him to cancel public appearances.

In October Depardieu reacted with an open letter to Le Figaro newspaper.

The US imports about 500,000kg of garlic a year

A US senator has called for a government investigation into the impact on national security of garlic imports from China.

Republican Senator Rick Scott has written to the commerce secretary, claiming Chinese garlic is unsafe, citing unsanitary production methods.

China is the world's biggest exporter of fresh and chilled garlic and the US is a major consumer.

But the trade has been controversial for many years.

The US has accused China of ""dumping"" garlic on to the market at below-cost price.

Since the mid-1990s it has levied heavy tariffs or taxes on Chinese imports in order to prevent US producers from being priced out of the market.

In 2019, during the Trump administration, these tariffs were increased.

In his letter Senator Scott refers to these existing concerns. But he goes on to highlight ""a severe public health concern over the quality and safety of garlic grown in foreign countries - most notably, garlic grown in Communist China"".

He refers to practices which, he says, have been ""well documented"" in online videos, cooking blogs and documentaries, including growing garlic in sewage.

He has called for the Department of Commerce to take action, under a law which allows investigations into the impact of specific imports on the security of the US.

Senator Scott also goes into much detail about the different types of garlic that should be looked into: ""All grades of garlic, whole or separated into cloves, whether or not peeled, chilled, fresh, frozen, provisionally preserved or packed in water or other neutral substance.""

He argues: ""Food safety and security is an existential emergency that poses grave threats to our national security, public health, and economic prosperity.""

The Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Quebec, which attempts to popularise and explain scientific issues, says there is ""no evidence"" that sewage is used as a fertiliser for growing garlic in China.

""In any case, there is no problem with this,"" an article published by the university in 2017 says.","Chinese garlic is a national security risk, says US senatorBy Theo Leggett Business correspondent, BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe US imports about 500,000kg of garlic a yearA US senator has called for a government investigation into the impact on national security of garlic imports from China.

By Chloe Kim BBC News

Watch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocide

A major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president.

In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished.

Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus.

She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign.

US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"".

American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago.

Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth.

They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?""

Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"".

There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks.

""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah.

In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill.""

The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"".

Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members.

Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates.

The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre.

University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has faced mounting calls to resign after her congressional testimony

Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position.

She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"".

She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"".

While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation.

He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"".

On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership.

""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test.""

A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon.

Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"".

The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"".

""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement.

Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination.""

The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"".

Islamophobic attacks have also been on the rise on university campuses.","Elizabeth Magill: UPenn loses $100m donation after House antisemitism testimonyBy Chloe Kim BBC NewsWatch: Moment top US university heads evade question on genocideA major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president.

The home where the famed civil rights leader spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmark

Alert bystanders stopped a woman as she attempted to set fire to the birth home of Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta, Georgia, police say.

Officials said the prompt action ""saved an important part of American history"".

The accused is in custody and faces charges of arson for allegedly pouring petrol onto the property.

The two-storey house where Dr King spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmark.

Its interior was acquired by the National Park Service in 2018 and has been closed to the public since last month for repairs and renovations.

Officers responded to the vandalism in progress in the city's Auburn Avenue Historic District about 17:45 local time (22:45 GMT) on Thursday, Atlanta police said in a news release.

A video shared with the local WSB-TV news channel shows a woman dressed in all black dousing the porch and front windows of the home.

By the time police arrived, the suspect had been stopped by two visiting filmmakers from Utah and two off-duty police officers from New York who were also visiting the home, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum told reporters.

One of the filmmakers, Zach Kempf, told the New York Times he initially thought the woman was watering shrubs in front of the house before she rushed up the stairs and pulled on the front screen door.

She did not respond when they asked what she was doing, emptying the contents of a five-gallon container before tossing it into the bushes and grabbing a lighter she had left on the grass, he said.

Mr Kempf, 43, said the woman had a ""nervous energy"" but was not aggressive and walked away after he physically blocked her path.

It was he who called 911 and shouted for help to the two New York officers, who chased down the suspect and restrained her until local police arrived.

The 26-year-old woman's father and three sisters, who arrived on the scene later, described her as a veteran in mental distress, Mr Kempf told the Times.

The accused was receiving a mental health evaluation before being transferred to the local jail, police said on Thursday night.

She could face further federal charges over her actions.

Local fire officials said no damage was done to the home and a hazardous materials team was cleaning up the scene.

""If the witnesses hadn't been here and interrupted what she was doing, it could have been a matter of seconds before the house was engulfed in flames,"" fire chief Jerry DeBerry said.

""It was really about the timing and the witnesses being in the right place at the right time.""

In a statement, the King Center confirmed the arson attempt had been unsuccessful ""thanks to the brave intervention of good Samaritans and the quick response of law enforcement"".

""Our prayers are with the individual who allegedly committed this criminal act,"" it added.","MLK house: Bystanders prevent attempt to burn down Dr King's birth homeBy Sam Cabral BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe home where the famed civil rights leader spent the first 12 years of his life is a federal landmarkAlert bystanders stopped a woman as she attempted to set fire to the birth home of Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta, Georgia, police say.

By Paul Adams BBC News, Jerusalem

Watch: The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen on what the images show

With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel.

The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers.

The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip.

The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released.

One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out ""invasive searches and humiliating treatment"" of civilians.

Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been ""discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago"".

In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them.

Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered.

Another image - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that ""IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects"".

""Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting.""

On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as ""Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"".

""We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago,"" he said.

Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to ""work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not"".

He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in ""close-quarter combat"" with Hamas. They had been ""deliberately disguising themselves as civilians"" and operating from civilian buildings.

The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia.

The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools.

The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said.

The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention.

In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as ""savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"".

""This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history,"" Husam Zomlot said.

A picture of the men, verified by the BBC, has been circulating on social media

Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees.

The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and ""other civilians"" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia.

Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the ""humiliating"" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday.

It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and ""subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations"".

The outlet ""urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault"" by Israel on journalists in the territory.

A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout.

Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim.

""We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked,"" she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.

Mr Putin would be 77 at the end of his fifth term

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will stand again for a fifth term in office.

He announced it at an awards ceremony for participants of the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine in 2022.

It comes a day after election officials set 15-17 March 2024 as dates for the presidential election.

The re-election of Mr Putin, 71, is seen as inevitable, with opposition almost non-existent and Russian media completely under his control.

Mr Putin served as president in 2000-08, returning to the role from a stint as prime minister in 2012. This means that he has already been in power in Russia longer than any ruler since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

Russia's constitution was amended in 2020, increasing the presidential term from four to six years and giving Mr Putin a clean slate to run again next year by cancelling out his previous terms.

A victory in March would see him remain as president until 2030. After that, he can then potentially serve another six years until 2036 if he decides to stand again.

Mr Putin - a former KGB officer - had been widely expected to run for the country's top job, amid huge challenges brought about by his invasion of Ukraine and resulting stand-off with the West.

He is unlikely to face any serious opposition, with most genuine opponents either dead, behind bars or in exile.

On Thursday, Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, announced the elections. Shortly afterwards, the country's electoral commission said they would be held over three days, from 15-17 March.

Following the announcement, the Kremlin's official spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that an ""astonishing"" number of people wanted Mr Putin to continue as leader.

He did not take long to make his intentions clear.

Mr Putin spoke at an informal gathering after a ceremony in the Kremlin to award Ukraine war veterans with the Hero of Russia medal.

His words were in answer to a request that he stand again for election from Lt-Col Artyom Zhoga, who heads a former pro-Russian separatist unit in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region - which Moscow declared annexed together with another three Ukrainian regions in September 2022.

""Now is the time when one needs to take decisions. I will be running for the post of president of the Russian Federation,"" Mr Putin said in remarks shown on Russian TV.

Mr Putin was handed the presidency at the very end of 1999 by his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin.

Key moments from Google's Gemini demo

A video showcasing the capabilities of Google's artificial intelligence (AI) model which seemed too good to be true might just be that.

The Gemini demo, which has 1.6m views on YouTube, shows a remarkable back-and-forth where an AI responds in real time to spoken-word prompts and video.

In the video's description, Google said all was not as it seemed - it had sped up responses for the sake of the demo.

But it has also admitted the AI was not responding to voice or video at all.

In a blog post published at the same time as the demo, Google reveals how the video was actually made.

Subsequently, as first reported by Bloomberg Opinion, Google confirmed to the BBC it was in fact made by prompting the AI by ""using still image frames from the footage, and prompting via text"".

""Our Hands on with Gemini demo video shows real prompts and outputs from Gemini,"" said a Google spokesperson.

""We made it to showcase the range of Gemini's capabilities and to inspire developers.""

In the video, a person asks a series of questions to Google's AI while showing objects on the screen.

For example, at one point the demonstrator holds up a rubber duck and asks Gemini if it will float.

Initially, it is unsure what material it is made of, but after the person squeezes it - and remarks this causes a squeaking sound - the AI correctly identifies the object.

However, what appears to happen in the video at first glance is very different from what actually happened to generate the prompts.

The AI was actually shown a still image of the duck, and asked what material it was made of. It was then fed a text prompt explaining that the duck makes a squeaking noise when squeezed, resulting in the correct identification.

In another impressive moment, the person performs a cups and balls routine - a magic trick where a ball is hidden underneath one of three moving cups - and the AI is able to determine where it moved to.

But again, as the AI was not responding to a video, this was actually achieved by showing it a series of still images.

In its blog post, Google explained that in fact it told the AI where a ball was underneath three cups, and showed it images which represent cups being swapped.

Google

It's not quite the same as AI responding to a live video

Google clarified that the demo was created by capturing footage from the video, in order to ""test Gemini's capabilities on a wide range of challenges"".

While sequences were shortened and stills were used, the voiceover from the video is taken directly from the written prompts fed into Gemini.

But there is another element of the video which further stretches the truth.

At one point, the user places down a world map, and asks the AI: ""Based on what you see, come up with a game idea... and use emojis.""

The AI responds by apparently inventing a game called ""guess the country"", in which it gives clues (such as a kangaroo and koala) and responds to a correct guess of the user pointing at a country (in this case, Australia).

Google

The guess-the-country game as showcased in the demo

But in fact, according to Google's blog, the AI did not invent this game at all.

Instead, the AI was given the following instructions: ""Let's play a game. Think of a country and give me a clue. The clue must be specific enough that there is only one correct country. I will try pointing at the country on a map,"" the prompt read.

The user then gave the AI examples of a correct and incorrect answer.

After this point, Gemini was able to generate clues, and identify whether the user was pointing to the correct country or not from stills of a map.

It is impressive - but it is not the same as claiming the AI invented the game.

Google's AI model is impressive regardless of its use of still images and text-based prompts - but those facts mean its capabilities are very similar to that of OpenAI's GPT-4.

And it is noteworthy that the video was released just two weeks after a period of unprecedented chaos in the AI space, following Sam Altman's dramatic firing - and rehiring - as CEO of OpenAI.","Google admits AI viral video was edited to look betterBy Tom Gerken Technology reporterGoogleKey moments from Google's Gemini demoA video showcasing the capabilities of Google's artificial intelligence (AI) model which seemed too good to be true might just be that.

By Chloe Kim BBC News

Reuters

Federal prosecutors have charged Hunter Biden with evading $1.4m (£1.1m) in tax payments, a second criminal case against the US president's son.

The nine-count indictment also details a lavish spending spree including drugs and escorts over the same period, from 2016 to 2019.

Mr Biden, 53, was indicted in September for owning a gun while on drugs and not declaring his addictions on a form.

His lawyer said on Thursday night the new charges are politically motivated.

President Joe Biden is not mentioned in the indictment and the White House has not commented.

It comes as congressional Republicans place Hunter Biden's business dealings at the centre of an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, who is seeking re-election next year.

If convicted in the tax case, Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison.

The three felonies and six misdemeanours include failure to file and pay taxes, false tax return and evasion of assessment.

US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss has been investigating the Yale-educated lawyer and recovering crack cocaine addict since 2019.

In a 56-page indictment filed in California, prosecutors allege he spent his money on ""drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes"".

They say the president's son ""individually received more than $7 million in total gross income"" between 2016 and 2020, but ""willfully failed to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxes on time, despite having access to funds to pay some or all of these taxes"".

Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, responded to the new charges by saying that ""if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought"".

Hunter Biden eventually paid all his taxes and fines back in 2020 - with the help of a loan from his personal attorney.

A chart inside the indictment outlines what Hunter Biden spent his money on.

Between 2016-19, he paid over $188,000 for ""adult entertainment"" and over $683,000 on ""payments - various women"", according to the charge sheet.

Hunter Biden ""continued to earn handsomely and to spend wildly in 2018"", prosecutors allege.

The indictment notes he made ""substantial"" income, including from a company he formed with a Chinese business conglomerate, the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and an unnamed Romanian businessperson.

As his income increased, so did his expenditures on an ""extravagant lifestyle"", says the indictment.

Hunter Biden tells BBC News his father ""saved"" him several times when he was in a dark place with his addiction battle

In 2018, the defendant spent more than $1.8m, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals, about $383,000 in payments to women and $151,000 on clothing.

Yet that same year, Hunter Biden texted his ex-wife that he could not make his alimony payment ""due to insufficient funds"".

He meanwhile stayed at various luxury hotels, spent $10,000 ""to purchase a membership in a sex club"" and claimed that $1,248 cross country airline tickets for an exotic dancer were a business expense, according to the indictment.

Prosecutors note that he ""had sufficient funds available… to pay some or all of his outstanding taxes when they were due"", but chose not to do so.

He allegedly often wrote off personal expenses as business expenses, like a rental of a Lamborghini that he drove when he first moved to California in April 2018 until his Porsche arrived from the east coast.

Earlier this year, Hunter Biden had been expected to plead guilty to misdemeanour tax charges in a deal with prosecutors.

But that agreement fell apart after a judge questioned it as ""unusual"". Congressional Republicans later slammed it as a ""sweetheart deal"".

This summer, two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whistleblowers testified to Congress that Hunter Biden should have been charged with more serious tax crimes, but alleged he received lenient treatment as the son of the president.

Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler said Thursday's indictment serves as ""complete vindication"".

The federal gun charges filed in September related to his being in possession of a gun while using narcotics and lying on a form about it. He pleaded not guilty.

The Super Gremlin rapper has faced several drug offences before

Rapper Kodak Black, who was pardoned three years ago by Donald Trump, has been arrested in Florida on drugs charges.

Officers said they noticed a strong smell of marijuana from a black Bentley SUV with the 26-year-old asleep at the wheel inside.

According to CBS News, police found a white powder later confirmed to be cocaine when they searched the vehicle.

Black, appeared in court on Thursday and was freed on a $75,000 bond.

The rapper, real name Bill Kapri, was accused of possession of cocaine, tampering with physical evidence and improperly stopping or parking a vehicle.

Regular drug testing is a condition of his release.

The Super Gremlin artist was also arrested last year on charges of trafficking in oxycodone and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription.

After reportedly failing to show up for multiple drug tests, he was ordered to spend 30 days in rehab earlier this year.

In January 2021, Black was on a list of more than 140 people who were pardoned by then-US president Donald Trump.

He had been sentenced to almost four years in jail in 2019 for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

But he served only half of his sentence after Trump intervened.

Following his release, Black thanked Trump on his track Last Day In and also expressed his support for the former president on social media.

The rapper has sold more than 30 million singles and has collaborated with artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott and Jason Derulo.","Kodak Black arrested on cocaine charges in FloridaBy Jasmine Sandhar BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Super Gremlin rapper has faced several drug offences beforeRapper Kodak Black, who was pardoned three years ago by Donald Trump, has been arrested in Florida on drugs charges.

The 2015 American Gold Buffalo 50-dollar coin contains one-troy ounce (31.1g) of pure gold

A foreign coin deposited into a charity's collection can has been called a ""Christmas cracker"" after it turned out to be worth £1,462.

The 2015 American Gold Buffalo 50-dollar coin was donated to Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance (SCAA).

Its true value was only discovered after being sent to a foreign currency exchange.

As the charity has collection cans all over Scotland it said it had no way of knowing where it was handed in.

SCAA community fundraising manager Kate Loades said when the cans are emptied and counted any foreign, out-of-date or misshapen coins are gathered in a box.

""When we have enough foreign coinage, it is sent for conversion to Sterling for our funds,"" she said.

""It could have been donated anywhere in Scotland. All we know is that we're hugely grateful to whatever kind person parted with their US coin to support the work of SCAA.

""Their generosity helps us to respond to critical injury and illness wherever we're needed in Scotland, so we thank them for making one of our collection cans a real Christmas cracker.""

The American Buffalo coin, also known as a gold buffalo, contains one-troy ounce (31.1g) of pure gold and has a face value of $50(£38).

It was first offered for sale by the US Mint in 2006 - since then the coin has increased considerably in value due to its popularity and the increase in the price of gold.

Last year the SCAA raised nearly £26,000 through collection can giving, but the charity said it has never raised as much money from a single can before.","Solid gold coin found in charity collection canSCAAThe 2015 American Gold Buffalo 50-dollar coin contains one-troy ounce (31.1g) of pure goldA foreign coin deposited into a charity's collection can has been called a ""Christmas cracker"" after it turned out to be worth £1,462.

The number of climate lawsuits globally has surged in recent years (Credit: Getty Images)

Governments, fossil fuel firms and airlines are increasingly being met with climate lawsuits. Isabella Kaminski analyses what difference this legal action is making, and how much it is helping fight climate change.

In 2015, a lawsuit of a kind that hadn't been seen before landed on the desk of Dutch government lawyers. The state was being sued for not doing enough to protect its citizens from climate change.

The claim, brought by the Dutch environmental advocacy non-profit Urgenda, was one of the first ripples in what has become a tsunami of climate litigation in recent years.

Now there are more than 2,500 lawsuits recorded globally, according to databases run by Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. And the climate litigation phenomenon shows no sign of stopping any time soon.

These lawsuits are helping rewrite the public narrative on climate change and, in some cases, are resulting in a real shift in government and corporate policy – whether they win or lose.

It has grown to have a life of its own – Joana Setzer

This wave of litigation is setting precedents for climate action all over the world, according to a report by the Sabin Center and UN Environment Programme (UNEP). In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) described litigation as one of several important new ways climate policy is being shaped.

Climate litigation has become a truly global movement, says Joana Setzer, assistant professorial research fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Setzer is confident that litigation is having a positive impact. ""It has grown to have a life of its own.""

Globally, 55% of cases have had a climate-positive ruling, according to the LSE's latest annual report which studies 549 lawsuits outside the US where courts had so far made a decision. (Similar analysis for case outcomes within the US is sparse). Of these climate-positive rulings, the finding was usually in favour of the claimant against a company or public authority. Some of these cases had a clear impact on public policy.

The after effects

So what kinds of changes have the most influential lawsuits made?

To take the seminal climate lawsuit, at the culmination of the Urgenda case the Netherlands' highest court ordered the Dutch government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 compared with 1990 levels – this was calculated as its fair share to combat the climate crisis. The country raised its climate action ambitions and explicitly listed ""Urgenda"" measures in its national budget for 2022.

Another clear example of a shift in policy was in Australia, when New South Wales' environmental watchdog released a draft of its first climate plan after bushfire survivors succeeded in arguing that the agency had a duty to do so.

Some lawsuits have blocked particular polluting projects. In 2022, a Queensland court recommended that Waratah Coal's plans to build a huge coal mine in the Galilee Basin, in north-east Australia, should be rejected over its ""unacceptable climate change impacts"" following a case brought by a First Nations-led group of young activists. Environmental authorisation for the project, led by billionaire Clive Palmer, has since been denied.

Litigation can also cushion a country's climate policy from political fluctuations. A recent far-right victory in the Netherlands' general election has raised concerns that the country's climate policy could be watered down. But the Urgenda decision set a minimum threshold for what the government must achieve.

""Judges are in an ideal position to adjudicate these types of issues because they can independently assess whether the government or corporation is creating a dangerous situation,"" says Sarah Mead, co-director of Urgenda's Climate Litigation Network. ""And they can do so beyond the vagaries of the electoral cycle.""

Mead says litigation can also trigger other institutions to consider the climate crisis. In South Korea, where campaigners are waiting for a result in the country's first constitutional climate lawsuit, the Human Rights Commission has submitted to the court a forthright opinion condemning the national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which it says violates the rights of future generations.

Extent of influence

Sometimes a legal victory goes on to have an impact well beyond its original borders.

A recent court ruling in the US, where 16 young people successfully argued that the state of Montana had violated their constitutional right to a ""clean and healthful environment"" by promoting the use of fossil fuels, was specific to the state's law, so does not set a direct legal precedent elsewhere. But law researchers such as Sarah Everhart, a law professor at Widener University, Pennsylvania, have said these developments give fuel to a growing US movement to add green provisions into state constitutions. This both clarifies government duties and gives campaigners a stronger legal basis on which to challenge a lack of climate action.

The Dutch case, meanwhile, inspired dozens of similar lawsuits being filed at national courts around the world, including in Germany, Belgium, Nepal and Colombia.

Many cases still fail, however, leaving campaigners to deal with the financial fallout, risks to their reputation and sometimes setting unhelpful legal precedents. ClientEarth, for example, recently lost its novel attempt to sue the board of Shell over the company's management of climate risks, and now faces a significant legal bill.

The enforcement issue

The direct influence of litigation can be difficult to untangle and is not always immediately positive. In both the UK and Ireland, campaigners are returning to court because they consider previous judgments challenging government climate policy have not been properly implemented.

Enforcement is a serious problem in some jurisdictions. Colombia's Supreme Court was celebrated for ruling in 2018 that the government must protect its part of the Amazon from deforestation for future generations. The Bogotá-based non-profit Dejusticia notes that serious deforestation continued until a change of government in 2022.

Even unsuccessful litigation, however, ""can shape narratives around climate action, encouraging decision-makers to change their approach"", the LSE report concluded.

For example, teenager Anjali Sharma failed in her attempt to establish through the courts that the Australian federal environment minister had a legal duty of care to protect young people from climate change. But she encouraged independent senator, David Pocock, to introduce a bill which, if passed, would require governments to consider the wellbeing of current and future children when making decisions that are likely to contribute to climate change.

More generally, experts say climate litigation helps raise awareness about the climate crisis and gives a boost to civil society. A YouGov poll on behalf of global civic group Avaaz found strong public support for a lawsuit brought by six young Portuguese people against 32 governments, which was heard at the European Court of Human Rights in late 2023.

The Irish Climate Case, meanwhile, has gathered a petition of over 12,000 signatures before winning at the Supreme Court in 2020. Clodagh Daly, manager of Community Law & Mediation's Centre for Environmental Justice who was closely involved in the case, says the final judgment mobilised climate activists in Ireland and legitimised their demands.

Changing the narrative

Setzer sees litigation as a ""powerful storytelling tool"", which can do more than science alone to communicate the problem and its underlying causes.

Successful litigation against governments has also planted the seeds for lawsuits against corporations. One of the most important so far was brought by Dutch NGO Milieudefensie against Shell. In 2021, the court ruled that Shell must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels – a decision the fossil fuel firm is appealing.

Eline Zeilmaker, senior legal advisor on the case for Milieudefensie, says the ruling shifted the way in which the Dutch press covered the climate crisis ""and it made people aware that corporations have a key role to play and they have to act now"".

The Shell case inspired other lawsuits, including one against Italian oil major Eni. Beyond the fossil fuel industry, an Indonesian island threatened by rising sea levels has started legal action against Swiss cement producer Holcim.

Claims against marketing greenwash have arguably been some of the most effective in making tangible changes. Earlier this year, European dairy company Arla Foods was banned from using the phrase ""net zero climate footprint"" when marketing its products in Sweden after a court ruled it had misled consumers. And Austrian Airlines was required by a court to post a message on its website's homepage and social media saying it had misled the public with adverts offering CO2-neutral flights.

As well as seeking to hold polluters accountable, campaigners say the aim of litigation is to shift wider corporate behaviour – and there is evidence this is now happening.

Following the success of its Shell case, Milieudefensie threatened 29 multinational corporations with legal action if they did not publish ambitious climate plans. Later that year, one of the targeted companies, Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize, significantly increased its corporate target to cut CO2 emissions. In particular, it aimed to reduce emissions from the supply chain of its supermarket brand Albert Heijn to 45% by 2030, compared with 2018 levels. Its previous goal had been a 15% reduction. Ahold Delhaize tells the BBC that its increased ambition was not related to Milieudefensie's campaign, and that it had already been working on revising its strategy in line with the latest climate science.

Milieudefensie is continuing to heap pressure on corporations, announcing that it has now chosen five financial institutions as potential litigation targets.

Ingrid Gubbay, European head of human rights and environmental law at law firm Hausfeld, says litigation has been a big driver of corporate climate risk management in recent years. ""These things are rattling the private sector, as they are policymakers.""

A study by the LSE found litigation posed a real cost risk to fossil fuel firms because it lowered their share prices. The stock market responded most strongly in the days after cases against carbon majors, which include the world's largest energy, utility and materials firms, cutting their relative value by an average of 0.57% after a case was filed, and by 1.5% after an unfavourable judgment.

There is no published research yet investigating the long-term impacts of climate litigation on corporate value. Nor is there any evidence that big fossil fuel firms have significantly changed their business models in response; despite the ongoing Dutch litigation against it, earlier this year Shell dropped a target it had set in 2021 to cut oil production gradually for the rest of the decade.

However, Setzer notes that even modest share price drops are a big deal for investors, banks and companies because of both the financial and reputational costs.

As a result, climate litigation is increasingly being viewed as a serious issue by financial institutions. At a recent conference, Frank Elderson, member of the European Central Bank's executive board, said it was becoming ""a major source of risk that needs to be properly anticipated and addressed"".

In May this year, the French bank BNP Paribas announced it would stop funding new gas projects. That came just a few months after campaigners sued the bank for financing fossil fuels in the first climate-related lawsuit against a commercial bank, a case that has not been dropped.

Gubbay says climate litigation in Europe has been one factor driving the development of new corporate sustainability laws. And lawyers expect it to be a recurring theme in annual reporting as companies around the world become subject to stricter disclosure rules. BP's climate-related financial disclosures report from April, for example, says legal proceedings could reduce its financial liquidity and credit ratings.

Even insurance companies are concerned. The Hawaii-based fossil fuel firm Aloha Petroleum sued its insurer for refusing to cover climate lawsuits against the company, in one of a small but growing number of such cases.

However, the UNEP and Sabin Center report also warned of a growing legal backlash that could delay climate action.

In the US, concerns have long been raised that companies working together on climate change could be hit with anti-trust lawsuits that penalise early movers and stymie further action. This has been a key tension point within an ailing industry net-zero alliance.

In some countries, vulnerable workers and communities are challenging action on climate change that they say disproportionately harms them and are not part of a just transition. The Mexican Center for Environmental Law, for example, is suing the Mexican government, arguing it has not considered how its energy sector programme for 2022-36 will improve overall wellbeing, reduce negative social and environmental impacts and guarantee human rights.

Companies are also seeking compensation for government climate policies through controversial dispute settlement systems embedded within investment treaties.

For example, in response to Queensland Land Court's recommendation on the Waratah coal mine, Palmer has begun legal action against the Australian government under a free trade agreement with Singapore. His Singapore-based company Zeph investments, which owns Waratah Coal, is claiming A$69bn ($45bn/£36bn) in compensation, alleging the judge had a biased ""pro-climate change, anti-coal"" stance.

A UN expert recently called for an end to these secretive court systems, saying they are delaying progress on climate change and other environmental crises and having ""enormous impacts on human rights"".

Setzer says courts are being used as battlegrounds, with litigation a weapon for both sides. ""How long this will last, I don't know. But for now it's had more impact than the many climate laws that have been passed. It has become the transnational movement that many would have wanted.""

By Alex Christian Features correspondent

Workers have largely resisted office returns, but their power has come to a screeching halt (Credit: Alamy)

The years-long tug of war between employers and employees looks to have finally settled.

Tension between workers and bosses has risen dramatically throughout the past few years – especially around the return-to-office battle. As employees seek to retain the flexibility they've prized for more than three years, employers have sought to instil greater rigidity, often through fixed working patterns that require employees at their desks.

Since the pandemic, workers have largely had the upper hand over executives, whether due to a favourable labour market or simple outright stubbornness to give up their remote set-ups. But 2023 marked a turning point: for the first time since Covid-19 hit, amid a weakening economy and cooling labour market, employers are coming out on top. Yet although this power struggle has seemingly ended in favour of bosses, workers haven't lost all they've fought for – millions of employees have ended up with greater flexibility, autonomy and pay than perhaps ever before. But going forward, say experts, the new hybrid working environment looks set to be dictated by employers for the foreseeable future.

How we got here

Fewer than four years ago, a full-time employee working from home even occasionally was extremely rare – a special privilege afforded to few, often under special circumstances. Then Covid-19 forced a mass exodus from the office. Suddenly, people had to work remotely, most for the first time, and many found they enjoyed the flexibility and autonomy it allowed them.

Even when lockdowns eased, and employers began attempting to call their employees back to their desks, many employees didn't budge for years. The immensely worker-favourable labour market during the pandemic – which saw employers clawing for a limited talent pool – meant employees had leverage to ask for what they wanted, or they'd leave. During this period, attempts by management to force a return to office were, in some cases, even the target of open revolt.

But the tide began turning in autumn 2022. A weakening economy and rising interest rates led to wide-scale job cuts, particularly in tech. As the world slowly emerged into post-pandemic life, the economic downturn coincided with some of the biggest firms pushing for an office return with renewed vigour. The pendulum had seemingly swung back towards employers, many of whom announced hiring freezes – workers began having less agency in a cooling job market.

Bosses had largely incentivised workers to return to the office through perks like free food and yoga. Employees just didn't go – so leaders began switching carrots for sticks – Grace Lordan

By January 2023, against a backdrop of layoffs, some bosses pulled back workers' flexibility. Large corporations, such as Disney and KPMG, began mandating more in-person days and monitoring attendance.

""Beforehand, bosses had largely incentivised workers to return to the office through perks like free food and yoga,"" says Grace Lordan, associate professor in behavioural science at the London School of Economics. ""Employees just didn't go – so leaders began switching carrots for sticks.""

Spring and summer

Worker power was far from completely diminished though, particularly in the US.

Amid a culture of mandates, employee activism continued through spring, most notably with the protests of corporate employees at Amazon against the company’s return-to-office plans. Many workers also still refused to follow strict hybrid protocols – data from Kastle Systems, measuring entry swipes at office buildings, shows that the average workplace occupancy among 41,000 businesses in the US has hovered below 50% throughout 2023.

In the UK, soaring inflation and a cost-of-living crisis meant more workers were willing to quit and find new jobs – if they could. This was a marked difference from past periods of financial downturns, in which employees tend to stay in their current roles. ""The cost-of-living crisis has spurred people to think, 'if my boss isn't giving me a pay rise that even meets inflation, it's about time I move on',"" says Lordan.

While employees remained emboldened in voicing their disapproval to bosses, a slowing job market meant they ultimately had much less leverage compared to just a year ago. Layoffs continued, and quit rates returned to pre-pandemic levels. By summer, the Great Resignation was declared ""over"" by experts. ""So much of the power balance is dictated by the labour market,"" says Lordan. ""When it's harder to go out and get another job, the power is with the employer.""

Autumn and winter

By September, the crackdown on remote working gathered pace, bosses' return-to-office rhetoric escalated and employee attendance increasingly became a disciplinary issue. Even companies synonymous with remote work, such as Zoom, began enforcing in-person working patterns.

""There was real momentum for the return to office in autumn 2023,"" explains Hannah Dwyer, EMEA head of work dynamics research and strategy at commercial real estate firm JLL, in Dublin. ""There was a 'back-to-school' mentality.""

As bosses' hybrid mandates intensified, their demand for new labour cooled – the traditional autumnal hiring spree was disrupted by a faltering economy. In the UK, Office for National Statistics data shows that estimated vacancies fell by 257,000 between August and October 2023, compared to the year before. In the US, a September spike in new jobs was met with a sudden drop in growth in October.

This recruitment slowdown weakened workers' power further still. LinkedIn data, seen by the BBC, shows that US hiring on the platform was down 13.4% year-over-year in October 2023, with UK hiring not only declining by 15.1% year-over-year, but also plummeting 7.2% below pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, job-seeker behaviour increased – the average number of applications per applicant in both the US and UK shot up by more than 21% over the same period.

Nela Richardson, chief economist at HR management firm ADP, in New York, says this supply-and-demand dynamic has meant fewer opportunities for workers – and jobseekers needing to be more willing to concede power to employers. ""This leads to job searches taking longer, fewer fully remote roles available and sharper trade-offs required for workers: whether that's relocating for a hybrid role, less flexibility overall or a smaller pay hike than expected.""

There was real momentum for the return to office in autumn 2023. There was a 'back-to-school' mentality ¬– Hannah Dwyer

The result is that many workers have been left frustrated – an ADP September survey of 2,500 US workers shows that engagement has taken a significant hit through 2023. ""We're seeing people less motivated and committed than last year, when workers had more power during the hiring crisis,"" says Richardson. ""Much of it comes from the slowdown in pay growth and opportunities for flexible working.""

Where it leaves workers

As we head into 2024, employers hold more power than at any time since Covid-19. However, this doesn't mean the pendulum has swung entirely back to its pre-pandemic position.

Flexibility, for instance, has become entrenched in many jobs. Employee expectations have settled at a much higher baseline than at the beginning of 2020, says Richardson. ""Two days a week working from home would have once been seen as a privilege, rather than the default business model at scale. Most companies are adding flexibility even if they're more office centric.""

A small subsection of the workforce may continue to hold greater leverage over their employers. This will likely occur in the most in-demand growth sectors, such as AI.

For example, the ousting of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by its board in November led to staff threatening mass resignations – less than a week later, he was back in the job. ""That's the type of scenario in which employees still have power,"" says Lordan, ""where they're at the cutting-edge of certain industries, and possess skills that are hard to replace.""

But, for most workers, there will be fewer opportunities to change jobs. As a result, they'll likely hold less sway when it comes to negotiating pay and autonomy – the two hallmarks of the hiring crisis, when firms were battling for talent.","How bosses won the fight for power in 2023By Alex Christian Features correspondentAlamyWorkers have largely resisted office returns, but their power has come to a screeching halt (Credit: Alamy)The years-long tug of war between employers and employees looks to have finally settled.

This intriguing Christmas bread has a secret filling (Credit: Nico Schinco)

Pan de regla is a Filipino bread distinguished by its colourful filling. At the holidays, author Abi Balingit shapes it into a star that's reminiscent of Christmas lanterns.

If you've stumbled upon a panaderia (neighborhood bakery) in the Philippines, chances are you have seen freshly baked pan de regla, the soft Filipino bread roll filled with a custard-like pudding that ranges in colour from bright pink to dark red. The so-called ""pink bread"" appears different from its cousins pandesal (Filipino bread roll) and pan de coco (coconut bread), with its vibrant-coloured filling. No other favourites from the panaderia look like this, which screams for attention and piques your interest.

Pan de regla literally translates to ""menstrual bread"" for its distinct filling, but there are 14 different names given to it in different parts of the country. Depending on who you talk to and where they are from, pan de regla may have a Filipino name, such as ligaya (happiness) and lahi (race of a people), while in some regions, the bread has an English name, such as ""everlasting"" and ""lipstick"".

<p><a href=""#Christmas star bread with pan de regla filling recipe"">[jump to recipe]</a></p>

Despite the quirky names given to pan de regla, another popular name is kalihim. According to Amy A Uy, author of the book Panaderia: Philippine Bread, Biscuit and Bakery Traditions, this probably comes from the Filipino word lihim, which means secret. It is named such because it's the bakers'""secret"" to make the pink filling using stale or leftover breads from the previous day, which are torn and mixed with butter, eggs, sugar and a hint of vanilla. When the filling reaches a paste-like consistency, dashes of bright red food colouring are added to enhance its colour. That filling is then baked into the bread roll.

Most pan de regla you'll see today is made traditionally, but some bakers steer away from that. Filipino-American Abi Balingit, author of the cookbook Mayumu: Filipino-American Desserts Remixed, published earlier this year, gives pan de regla a twist and recreates it in the form of a star-shaped bread with the characteristic red custard filling. ""I was fascinated with this [kind of] bread sold at bakeries, but it's the colour [of the filling] that really struck me,"" Balingit said. ""It's funny when I think about where the name comes from; there's so much multi-meaning coming from pan de regla that I admire. I also love the taste of it, so I wanted to incorporate the flavours minus the shape.""

Balingit's enticing star-shaped take on pan de regla is inspired by Filipino lanterns called parols. In the months leading to Christmas, these lanterns light up the streets, showcasing their intricate designs, geometric patterns and colourful lights. For Filipinos, parols are a reminder of family and a symbol of hope in troubling times. ""One of my happiest memories growing up in San Jose [California] was seeing my parents put up parols every Christmas,"" said Balingit, who started baking at age 13. ""I love parols and it's what has inspired me to create the shape.""

The star-shaped bread is a fun way for families or friends to get involved and pull the bread apart as they eat it, as it has three layers of custard woven throughout. Pan de regla is also sometimes filled with purple ube (yam) or pineapple, but Balingit sticks to the usual ingredients. ""It's one of the recipes that didn't require me to go out of the way to source ingredients because everything can be found at a standard grocery store,"" she added.

In the final stage, the pre-baked stars are coated with egg yolks and milk to add some richness and fat while baking, then brushed with melted butter for a glossy sheen and dusted with powdered sugar for a festive look. Though it may not be a regular pan de regla sold at a panaderia, Balingit says Filipinos will still find the flavours nostalgic and the textures soft and pillowy. Who knows, you might just start making this bread all year round.

Christmas star bread with pan de regla filling recipe by Abi Balingit

Makes 16 servings

Ingredients For the custard filling: 2 cups small torn pieces white bread or pandesal 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1 large egg, at room temperature ⅓ cup granulated sugar ¼ tsp kosher salt 8 to 10 drops red gel food colouring 2 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tsp vanilla extract For the bread dough: 1 cup whole milk 2¼ tsp active dry yeast ¼ cup granulated sugar 4 tbsp (½ stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into tbsp-size pieces 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 tsp kosher salt 390g (3¼ cups) all-purpose flour nonstick spray For assembly: 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature 1 tbsp whole milk, at room temperature 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted 1 tbsp icing sugar

Method

Step 1 To make the custard filling, place the white bread pieces in a medium bowl. In a large measuring cup, whisk together the milk, egg, granulated sugar, salt and red food colouring. Pour the mixture over the bread and stir lightly with a whisk. Let sit at room temperature for 8 to 10 minutes for the bread to absorb the milk mixture.

Step 2 Pour the contents of the bowl into a medium saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until it forms a thick paste, 5 to 7 minutes. Most of the liquid should be cooked out of the mixture. Immediately stir in the butter and vanilla and mix until smooth. Set aside to cool completely. You can save the custard in an airtight container for up to 4 days in the fridge.

Step 3 To make the bread dough, in a small microwave-safe measuring cup, heat the milk in the microwave for 30-second intervals until it reaches 42C to 43C (108F to 110F). Stir in the yeast and 2 tsp of the granulated sugar. Let sit for 10 minutes for the yeast to bubble up. It will look foamy once activated.

Step 4 Add the yeast mixture to a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon, mix in the remaining sugar, the butter, egg and salt until well combined. Stir 360g (3 cups) of the flour into the mixture until it forms a shaggy dough.

Step 5 Lightly flour your work surface with the remaining 30g (¼ cup) flour. Turn the contents of the bowl over onto your lightly floured surface. Knead until it becomes a smooth and elastic dough ball, 15 to 18 minutes. When you poke the dough with your finger, it should spring back. It will be really sticky at first, but keep on kneading until you get there!

Step 6 Grease another large bowl with nonstick spray. Place the kneaded dough ball in it and cover with clingfilm. Let it proof at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat and set aside.

Step 7 Set the clingfilm aside and punch the dough down. Divide into four equal portions and roll them into balls. Grab one of the dough balls. Cover the remaining balls with the clingfilm while you roll one at a time. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough ball into a 25cm diameter (10in circle). Wrap the dough circle around the rolling pin. Carry it over to the centre of the lined baking sheet. Slather ⅓ cup of the filling over the circle in an even layer on top of the dough.

Step 8 Repeat the process with the rest of the dough portions, stacking each layer of dough and alternating it with the filling, until there is a final layer of rolled-out dough on top. You can stretch the edges of each circle if they aren't perfectly lining up, and you can trim uneven edges with a pizza slicer for a rounder shape.

Step 9 Lightly indent the centre of the dough with a 6.35cm (2½-inch) round cookie cutter. Starting from the outer edge of the dough and stopping when you reach the scored circle at the centre, make 16 equal cuts, like the petals of a flower, using a pizza slicer. Grab two adjacent pieces. Twist and rotate the two pieces outward twice, then pinch the edges together with your fingers to form the points of the star. Repeat this process with the rest of the pieces.

Step 10 Cover the shaped star with clingfilm and let it rise for 25 to 30 minutes, or until it puffs up. While the dough is rising, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 175C (350F).

Step 11 Once the dough has risen, remove the clingfilm. Reseal the edges if the points of the star have opened up. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks and milk together until smooth. Using a pastry brush, coat the surface of the bread with the egg wash. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until golden brown.

Step 12 Transfer the baking sheet to a wire cooling rack. Using a pastry brush, brush the star bread with the melted butter and let it cool for 7 to 10 minutes. Using a small sieve, top the bread with a light dusting of the icing sugar before serving warm. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

On this day in 1980, John Lennon was murdered outside his home in New York City, and ever since Beatles fans have speculated about what might have transpired with the band had he lived. A rediscovered 1975 interview with Lennon from the BBC archive gives some clues.

Beatle John Lennon met Mark Chapman – the man who was to kill him – twice on the day he died, 8 December 1980.

The first time was at around 5pm. Having finished a radio interview in their apartment in the Dakota building in New York to promote their new album, Double Fantasy, the musician and his artist wife Yoko Ono headed out on to the street. Mark Chapman approached Lennon to ask if he could sign a copy of the new LP. The album was later used as evidence in Chapman's trial, and reportedly went on to sell in a private auction for $1.5m in 2020.

Lennon, having signed it and posed for a picture with Chapman, jumped into a taxi with Ono to the recording studio to work on a new song called Walking on Thin Ice.

They returned home by car at around 10:30 pm. They had planned to go to a restaurant, but – according to a 2007 BBC interview with Ono – John was anxious to say goodnight to his younger son Sean before the five-year-old boy went to sleep. The couple stepped out of their vehicle, and began to walk towards the Dakota building, John carrying cassettes from the day’s recording session.

Mark Chapman was there waiting for him, holding a copy of JD Salinger's novel Catcher in the Rye and the LP that Lennon had signed for him hours earlier. As the musician walked past him, Chapman pulled out a handgun, and fired multiple times into his back.

The senselessness of the murder sent shockwaves of disbelief around the world. It is difficult to overstate the profound effect The Beatles had as a cultural phenomenon, and what they meant to people. They weren't merely pop stars. They changed the landscape of popular music. Their experiments with music, film, fashion, drugs and religion had been at the forefront of the 1960s, when the world seemed to be going through seismic changes. Their music had soundtracked a whole generation of people's lives, helping them to connect to what was going on around them and to each other.

Following the shooting, grief-stricken fans flocked to the Dakota building to leave flowers and cards. For days, radio stations played nothing but The Beatles and John Lennon songs. In his hometown of Liverpool, 30,000 people gathered to hold a 10-minute silence, as did more than 225,000 in Central Park, close to where he was shot dead.

A deeper significance

His music, which had meant so much to people during his life, took on an even deeper significance after his death. In the UK, the song (Just Like) Starting Over from the Double Fantasy album went to number one in the charts, only to be quickly knocked off the top spot by 1971's Imagine, which in turn was followed by Woman. His last record became a worldwide hit, and went on to win a Grammy for album of the year.

In the decades since, the one question that has haunted fans is this: if Lennon hadn't been killed that day, would the Beatles have eventually got back together to make more music?

In 1975, Lennon had already collaborated on songs with both George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and had rekindled his friendship with Paul McCartney

Five years before this death, in an episode of the BBC's music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, presenter Bob Harris asked former Beatle if there was any possibility of the Fab Four working together again and, more importantly, would it be a good idea?

By that point the Beatles had gone through a bruising break-up in 1970, following the fractious Let It Be recording sessions the year earlier. The animosity between the band members surrounding the split had often played out in public.

But in the years following that, the estrangement and creative difficulties between them had started to mellow. By the time of the BBC interview in 1975, Lennon had already collaborated on songs with both George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and had rekindled his friendship with Paul McCartney.

""You see, it's strange because at one period when they were asking me I'd say 'No, never, what the hell, go back? No, not me,' and then I came to a period where I thought why not? If we felt like making a record or doing something,"" he told Harris.

""I think over the period of being apart, we've all thought wouldn't it be nice, that wouldn't be bad. I've worked with Ringo and George but I haven't worked with Paul because we had a more difficult time but now we are pretty close.

""The other question is would it be worth it? That's answered by if we wanted to do it. If we wanted to do it then it would be worth it. If we got in the studio together and turned each other on again, then it would be worth it, sod the critics.""

His untimely death would rob the Beatles of that opportunity in person, but it wasn't the end of their musical collaboration together.

Watch John Lennon candidly answer: Will The Beatles ever reunite?

Fourteen years after his murder, his widow Ono gave a demo tape of songs that her late husband had written in 1978 – with the words ""For Paul"" written on it – to the remaining Beatles.

Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr built upon Lennon's original demo of his voice and piano, adding their own vocals and instrumentation to the tracks, resulting in the release of the first ""new"" Beatles singles since their break-up. First, Free as a Bird in 1995, and then Real Love in 1996.

Now and then

At the time, the band also attempted to record another track called Now And Then, but found that the quality of the recording was too poor to work with and, frustrated, abandoned the recording session.

It was when working with Peter Jackson on his archive documentary of those 1969 Let It Be recording sessions that the surviving Beatles, Paul and Ringo – George had died of cancer in 2001 – decided to revisit the song and try again.

Peter Jackson's documentary aimed to show that, despite the personal tensions between the Beatles members during those sessions, there were also plenty of examples of their tight-knit friendship, musical collaboration and creative harmony, especially when they were joking around or jamming together, which had been left out of the original 1970 documentary.

In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today

To improve the audio, the film company developed software that could separate out the jumbled up, overlapping sounds that were present in the documentary outtakes, allowing a more nuanced picture of the recording sessions to emerge.

This technology was used on the demo cassette that Ono had given the surviving Beatles in the 1990s, enabling them to distinguish and extract Lennon's voice from surrounding audio on the tape.

In 2022, Paul and Ringo returned to the studio to finish the track. As well as adding their instrumental parts and backing vocals to John’s voice, they also added the guitar parts recorded by George Harrison in their original attempt to finish the song in 1995. A new string arrangement by producer Giles Martin, son of The Beatles' original producer George Martin, helped complete the track.

The final song, Now and Then, was released this year, credited to all four Beatles. The poignant, contemplative piano ballad, with all four Beatles once again working in harmony, marks a fitting final chapter to John Lennon's remarkable musical legacy.

Bangladesh is one of the world's most climate vulnerable countries. But small steps, like building resilient homes and providing job opportunities, can make a huge difference.

Every time the wind blows in gusts, 55-year-old Noor Alam remembers the devastating tropical cyclone that hit Bangladesh's Kutubdia Island in 1991, killing 20 members of his family.

Over the next several years, the island was hit by frequent cyclones, forcing Alam and his wife Rahima Begum, who lost two of her siblings in the 1991 disaster, to migrate to Banshkhali, a region in Chittagong, in the southeastern district of Bangladesh. But even here, the couple couldn't escape natural disasters.

Between 1998 and 2020, their thatched cottage, made from bamboo sticks and plastic sheets, collapsed six times after cyclones hit the porous pavement of the Banshkhali Beribundh, an embankment of a dyke constructed to protect crops from flooding. Alam and his wife were forced to borrow money to rebuild their home. Each disaster, their children experienced the trauma of displacement and were left without permanent sanitation facilities and a reliable source of drinking water.

In 2021, however, their situation dramatically improved. With the help of a regional non-profit called Young Power in Social Action (YPSA), the family moved to a semi-pucca, a house with brick walls and a tin roof – materials that fare better in extreme weather than a thatched house. ""I cannot explain how important this house is for the safety of my family. Earlier we used to live like poultry,"" says 55-year-old Alam.

Frequent natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, and storm surges, as well as drought, river bank erosion, and deadly heatwaves have made Bangladesh one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The government estimates that by 2050, one in every seven Bangladeshis will be displaced due to climate change – that's 13.3 million people.

The population that lives along the country's 441mile (710km) low-lying coastal region has been particularly impacted, with 2,000 people moving to the country's capital Dhaka every single day.

COP28: The fight for loss and damage funding At COP28, countries agreed to launch a long-awaited fund to pay for loss and damage caused by climate-driven storms, floods and droughts. Climate vulnerable countries have been calling for such a fund for more than 30 years, arguing that money to help them recover from extreme weather events is critical for their survival. Wealthy countries have previously resisted these calls out of concern they could be held liable for decades of pollution.

Bangladesh has redoubled its efforts to address its climate refugee crisis and initiatives have sprung up to help families like Alam's build stable homes in safer areas. YPSA, which is supported by the Climate Justice Resilience Fund (CJRF), a non-profit in Washington, has provided new houses and alternative livelihood sources to eight vulnerable families who have been forced to leave their homes due to severe erosion along Bangladesh's Chittagong coast.

The YPSA project is funded by a $250,000 (£198,000) grant from the Scottish government, funnelled through CJRF. During Cop26, held in Glasgow in 2021, Scotland became the first country in the world to set aside specific funding for loss and damage, pledging £2m ($2.5m) to help communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

In 2021, YPSA rehoused Alam's family in a two-room house in Khudukkhali, a village situated three quarters of a mile (1.2km) east of the Chittagong coast. The house has been built to withstand storms. The green tin roof is fixed to sturdy concrete walls with iron braces and horizontal beams, and steel windows and doors protect the residents from powerful gusts. Each house has a pit toilet in the backyard, which does not overflow following heavy rainfall.

""We considered the last flood level, so the houses were built on 3-4ft (91-122cm) high elevated land,"" says Mohammad Shahjahan, one of the directors at YPSA. ""We built the houses with better construction materials that will withstand 137mph (220 km/h) gusts and require minimal repairs over the next 50 years.""

The construction of each YPSA house cost 670,000 Bangladesh taka (BDT), equivalent to $7,706 (£6,103) in 2021, nearly double the amount that a similar house costs under the government-led Ashrayan project, an initiative launched in 1997 to provide homes to coastal residents displaced by tornados. This is because the Ashrayan houses are built on government-owned land, so no extra funds are needed for land purchases.

YPSA plans to rehouse eight more families by April 2024, using the Scottish government funding. These efforts are merely tackling the tip of the iceberg, says Shahjahan, given the hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis who have been displaced due to climate disasters.

The organisation is also providing people displaced by extreme weather with new job opportunities. A 2019 YPSA survey of 15,000 people, all of whom live in temporary structures by the roadside in the southeastern coastal belt, found that 50% of displaced households were forced to change their occupation due to cyclones and coastal erosion. YPSA is working to economically empower 40 displaced women, by providing them with goats, sewing machines and training to become tailors.

I cannot explain how important this house is for the safety of my family. Earlier we used to live like poultry – Noor Alam

Jannatul Ferdous is among the beneficiaries. She received livestock training and a pregnant goat. Eight months ago, the goat gave birth to two male kids. Ferdous, now 30, arrived in Banshkhali 15 years ago when she married her husband, who was a fisherman. Like other housewives from low-income families, Ferdous managed the home and her husband was the breadwinner. Although her family survived when Cyclone Mahasen hit the Chittagong coast in 2013, her husband died shortly afterwards. It was a huge blow to Ferdous, who had given birth to her second son in the same year. To raise her two sons, the widow became a house servant of some well-off neighbours. She earned 3,000 BDT ($27/£21) a month, barely enough to cover basic living expenses.

Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 70kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.

When Cyclone Sitrang flooded the Banshkhali coast and Ferdous' cottage in 2022, she was forced to stay at the cyclone shelter for weeks until some of her neighbours were able to repair her house. The recent Cyclone Hamoon blew away the porch of her house, which is made from rusted tin sheets.

Holding two male goats on her lap, Ferdous says: ""The livestock training programme has made me confident. I hope I can expand my goat farm someday. I will repair the house when I can sell these goats.""

Umme Sultana, a 16-year-old from Kutubdia, a 27sqm (68sqkm) island that is shrinking due to coastal erosion, chose to enrol in a tailoring course and received a sewing machine through the YPSA project.

In May, her family's fragile cottage was partially damaged by Cyclone Mocha. It was impossible for her father, who works on a marine fishing boat, to bear the total cost of the house repair. So he borrowed money. Sultana wanted to contribute but didn't have the means.

However, since joining YPSA's programme, the family's situation has changed. Sultana now earns 2,000-2500 BDT ($18-22/£14-17) per month from tailoring clothes by hand. She contributes to her family's earnings and is also able to pay for her own education. ""I will continue my studies because I cherish becoming a nurse,"" she says.

Farah Kabir, a board member of South Asia's Climate Action Network and the country director for the non-profit ActionAid Bangladesh, says that YPSA's interventions are a lifeline for vulnerable communities. ""[This] provides the vulnerable community with immediate support so that they can recover from the damage that they have suffered,"" says Kabir.

Kabir says financial support for loss and damage should be set aside in addition to the funds countries have pledged for climate mitigation and adaptation. Governments require international funding not only to help them adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change, but also to cope with what has already occurred.

""The community may have lost their homesteads, livelihood, crops and cattle. Their children may have lost their childhood because of serving as labourers or getting married off earlier. They may have lost health due to water scarcity and poor sanitation,"" says Kabir. ""To recover from this loss and damage, they need immediate support which is beyond adaptation or mitigation.""

By 2050, one in seven Bangladeshis will be displaced due to climate change

Vulnerable countries, including small island nations at risk of rising sea levels and countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffering from severe drought, argue that loss and damage is a climate justice issue. (Read more about the world's fight for climate justice). ""It is not fair that the countries and communities on the frontline of the climate crisis continue to pay. This is why it is essential that we address loss and damage on a global scale,"" says Julie-Anne Richards, strategy lead at the Loss & Damage Collaboration , a climate policy group advocating for more support for climate vulnerable countries.

Despite the urgent need, helping displaced people in Bangladesh rebuild their lives and livelihoods remains a challenge, says Shahjahan. One of the major hurdles is finding land to move the displaced families to.

""The availability of undisputed land is rare,"" he says. ""Many of the land purchases YPSA attempted to secure have fallen through. This is the main reason we cannot build the houses in time,"" says Shahjahan.

He adds that there are too many people seeking aid and not enough available funding. ""Selecting a few [people] from a large pool of displaced populations is another big challenge,"" he says, adding that elected public representatives often put pressure on YPSA to select their favourite families.

YPSA is currently implementing the third phase of its loss and damage project, with funding from the Scottish government. The non-profit is building a further eight houses in Kutubdia and Shadhanpur. Each house will have its own toilet and a shared tube well for drinking water.

YPSA has purchased the land but has been unable to build the houses because of the delayed monsoon this year. ""Often, we cannot work around the islands and coastal localities in the time of incessant rains,"" says Shahjahan. Another challenge is finding experienced non-profits locally to implement Scotland's loss and damage funds on the ground, he says.

The project ends in April 2024. After this, YPSA will be moving families to other areas with existing programmes in place. ""We have linked [the families] to government-funded safety-net programmes so that they don't feel isolated in the future,"" says Shahjahan.

Alam's family now owns a disaster-resilient house in an area where they feel strong social cohesion. Their children attend a nearby school and the cyclone shelter centre is located nearby. And yet, the family still faces disaster-related threats.

In October, Cyclone Hamoon failed to breach the defences of Alam's house, but the storm destroyed his thatched kitchen room and poultry shed in the courtyard.

""The rehabilitation project covers my family's housing. We feel safe now,"" Alam says. ""But we cannot protect our homesteads and animals from disasters. If my poultry farm expands, I will need to move the animals to the cyclone shelter centre. I will not stay at home.""

Egg freezing is among the proactive fertility treatments women seek (Credit: Getty Images)

Many women are seeking new services to plan their future parenthood. They can be empowering, but some argue there's a dark side to the growing business.

A few years ago, Elizabeth King, a fertility coach and counsellor based in Los Angeles, noticed a change in the clientele contacting her for help. Previously, King had mostly supported women going through infertility and pregnancy loss, but she increasingly found people were reaching out for information about their fertility, long before they began trying to conceive.

""Many of these clients come in with concerns about their age, medical history and often the anecdotal experiences, or information they've gathered from various media,"" says King. ""The common thread among them is the desire for reassurance and control over their reproductive choices.""

In response, an entire industry is growing to cater to these changing attitudes, offering fertility services to help women assess, understand, improve or prolong their fertility before trying to conceive. There's demand: data shows products and treatments such as egg freezing, fertility testing (often referred to as ""fertility MOTs"") and pre-conception consultations are growing in popularity, and even being offered as a workplace perk by some companies.

For firms that offer women these proactive fertility services, business is booming – and many people feel empowered by having new options to plan their futures. Yet alongside the benefits, experts caveat that some companies can sometimes provide questionable – even murky – guidance.

A growing industry with a growing demand

In almost all countries worldwide, the age women are having children has dramatically increased. Researchers suggest that in the Western world – where proactive fertility services are most common – economic uncertainty, limited housing availability and increased labour-market participation among women contribute to people delaying childbearing.

Experts say factors like these are propelling the rapid growth of the proactive fertility business, with the worldwide fertility-testing industry (which includes at-home and in-clinic testing) projected to be worth $680m (£540m) by 2025, up from $472m (£375m) in 2020. Egg freezing is currently the fastest growing fertility treatment.

""Between 2011 and 2021 there has been an 11-fold increase in egg-freezing cycles in the UK, and the number continues to rise,"" says UK-based Cristina Hickman, chief clinical officer at Fairtility, which designs AI tools to assist IVF clinicians.

Hickman, who is also the co-founder and chief operating officer at UK-based fertility clinic Ovom, says the increase in proactive fertility services is, in part, due to evolving technologies. She says it's only within the past 10 years that medical professionals have viewed egg freezing as an effective procedure (until 2012, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine classified the now widely used egg-freezing technique as ""experimental"").

As these processes have become increasingly mainstream, many women are finding more access to these technologies and, in some cases, feel more comfortable with embracing them as options.

'Falling short of delivering on promise'

For many, the rise of proactive fertility treatments means increased freedom around reproductive choices.

Individuals who don't feel ready or able to have a child, these services offer a way to make informed choices that may improve chances of future conception. For some, the benefits may be as simple as alleviating anxieties around fertility in a world where women's ""biological clocks"" are an oft-cited worry.

""Women who move forward with fertility MOTs or egg freezing have more of a sense of freedom in their future,"" says King. ""They provide valuable information about reproductive health, which can guide personal and medical decisions.""

King says these services have many benefits, but she also has concerns about their use. For some people, she believes, they can instil a false sense of security.

It takes two to make a baby, and half of patients needing fertility assistance suffer from male-factor infertility – Cristina Hickman

Although egg freezing is on the rise, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority found in 2017 that of all the frozen eggs thawed in the UK since 2013, only around 15% of these were fertilised and transferred. Of those, only 13% resulted in pregnancy – a total of 22 pregnancies out of 1,204 thawed eggs. In the US, individual fertility clinics have reported more optimistic results, with one suggesting a 39% success rate per patient who undergoes thawing and implantation. Still, this figure suggests that fertility preservation remains a far from failsafe option. As the procedures become more widespread, emerging data will provide an even clearer picture of current outcomes.

Some experts also express concerns around fertility testing procedures. ""Patients may have tested hormones, but not had an ultrasound, or vice versa, or haven't looked at the man's fertility, or haven't done carrier genetic screening,"" says Hickman.

For instance, although most proactive fertility care is targeted at and marketed towards women, it is estimated that around 40% to 50% of infertility cases are due to ""male-factor infertility"" – often caused by low sperm concentration or poor sperm mobility. This has led to fears that some proactive fertility companies are preying on heightened fears about infertility among women in their marketing.

""It takes two to make a baby, and half of patients needing fertility assistance suffer from male-factor infertility,"" says Hickman.

'Falling short'?

With numerous factors that could impact fertility, some experts believe that fertility testing – which usually only evaluates hormones and ovarian reserves – is being oversold. Recent research showed that many at-home ovarian-reserve testing companies ""fall short of delivering on their promise"", due to the limited factors that are measured, and a lack of reliability.

This means that people could make life-changing decisions about their reproductive health based on insufficient data.

Some experts also have concerns about the profit-driven nature of the proactive fertility industry. Kavelle Christie, the director of the Gender Equity and Health Justice Program at health-advocacy group Community Catalyst, argues that although some proactive fertility services such as at-home fertility testing can be relatively affordable, the cost of acting on any information is often hugely expensive.

Fertility preservation: When should you freeze your eggs?

""The fertility industry is a multibillion dollar one, and pre-emptive fertility treatments, unfortunately, like many other areas in healthcare, are often driven by profit instead of patient-centred care,"" she says. ""The prohibitively high out-of-pocket costs associated with these services often prevent people from acting on any information or questions about their health, contributing to an accessibility gap.""

The average cost of an egg-freezing cycle and thawing currently sits at around £7,000 to £8,000 in the UK, and $8,000 to $15,000 in the US. Doctors recommend numerous cycles of egg collection to improve chances of success, which may cost an additional £4,000 to £5,000 per time. Increasingly, this cost has driven workplaces to offer egg freezing as a workplace perk, with companies such as Apple and Facebook funding up to $20,000 worth of egg freezing.

This means that many proactive fertility services are the preserve of the wealthy or those employed by large and well-resourced corporations, and Christie says that low-income individuals and those living in rural communities where healthcare is hard to access are often excluded from the advances in fertility care that the industry.

'Not everyone who is marketed these services will need them'

For many women in their late 20s or early 30s, social media advertisements for fertility testing or egg freezing will be commonplace.

Research shows reproductive-age women are ""overwhelming"" targets of marketing for at-home fertility testing, and a recent survey of women who used period-tracking apps found that more than half had noticed an increase in baby- or fertility-related advertisements. For some women, experts worry the aggressive marketing of these services can lead to unnecessary worries about fertility, and an exaggerated sense of how likely women are to struggle to conceive.

There is the potential for such services to feed into anxieties about fertility, especially when marketing plays on fears of declining fertility with age. Not everyone who is marketed these services will need them – Elizabeth King

""There is the potential for such services to feed into anxieties about fertility, especially when marketing plays on fears of declining fertility with age,"" says King. ""Not everyone who is marketed these services will need them.""

Flawed, but important

The proactive fertility industry is a relatively new but rapidly growing area of healthcare. As the sector continues to grow it's important, says Christie, that access to them is fair and affordable.

""These services are always worthwhile for people who want to understand better what's happening inside their bodies or start a family when and if they want,"" she says. ""All people should have access to this kind of care and information to make personal decisions.""

King adds although there are issues with the way that proactive fertility care is marketed, and concerns about encouraging women to delay motherhood without a full understanding of the risks involved, she would still encourage people who have concerns to explore their options.","The proactive fertility care industry is soaring.

By Richard Collett Features correspondent

Kukës: The first city ever nominated for a Nobel Prize (Credit: Richard Collett)

At the height of the Kosovo war, this 16,000-person area welcomed more than 400,000 refugees. Now, Kukës is tapping into its unique history of conflict and compassion to lure visitors.

Lush Alida Ismailaj was helping a French reporter cross the border from Albania into Kosovo when a bomb exploded nearby, spraying shrapnel and debris across a road packed with fleeing refugees.

""The border was dangerous,"" Ismailaj said, recalling how she helped international journalists document the escape of more than 400,000 refugees through her hometown of Kukës, Albania, at the height of the Kosovo war between March and June 1999. ""It was mined and bombed. Kukës was the first safe place you could stop.""

Despite having a population of just 16,000, the tiny city, which is 20km from the border, welcomed a staggering number of refugees into homes and makeshift camps. Kukës made headlines worldwide, and in 2000 it became the first city to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. The fame was short-lived. Already dealing with myriad crises after the fall of Albanian communism in 1992, once the Kosovo war ended and the refugees returned home, Kukës experienced an exodus of its own, as 53% of residents left Albania's poorest city in search of economic opportunities abroad.

Now, as visitor numbers to Albania increase, locals like Ismailaj are hoping that tourism can offer an incentive for the next generation to stay. With Kukës' brand-new international airport, mountainous hiking trails, communist relics and a heroic tale to tell, residents are turning to their unique history of conflict, resilience and generosity to lure travellers to one of the lesser-known corners of one of Europe's least-visited nations.

Located at the confluence of the White and Black Drin rivers in north-eastern Albania, Kukës' uniform apartment blocks are overshadowed by the snow-capped mountain peak of Gjallica. A 20-minute drive east through mountain passes brings you to Kosovo, where Albanian-Kosovars fought for independence during the last stages of the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1999.

Bujar Kovaci, a part-time tour guide, knows all too well the hardships endured in a borderland fraught with danger. ""I am a [landmine] survivor,"" he said when we met outside Hotel Gjallica in the centre of Kukës. ""I'm very lucky that I'm alive today.""

Kovaci was just 10 years old when he picked up a landmine while playing in the countryside near the border. Not knowing what it was, he hit the casing with a rock and it exploded. His family rushed him to the hospital in Kukës, and he awoke two weeks later, his left eye sightless and his right arm missing from the elbow down.

""In 1999 there were so many accidents here,"" he said. In all, 120km along the Albania-Kosovo border was heavily mined with explosives. ""For years after, they were still clearing the mines…. many were injured like me.""

With the help of local outfitter Albanian Trip, Kovaci is now developing tours to showcase the history and culture of Kukës, as well as the surrounding mountain passes, hiking trails, waterfalls and villages. His tours don't shy away from Kukës' turbulent past, and profits are invested back into a local association that supports landmine victims. Kovaci hopes that if he can entice tourists to this seldom-visited part of Europe, he can not only help others injured by unexploded bombs, but also help incentivise people to stay and preserve Kukës' local culture in the face of economic migration.

As the Nobel nomination showed, Kukës residents are accustomed to welcoming visitors – something I began to understand when we stopped outside a tower in Kukës' main square, which serves as a memorial to those who sought shelter here in 1999 and houses a small ethnographic museum. Kovaci explained how Kukës managed to host hundreds of thousands of refugees by families opening up their homes to an astonishing 90,000 people, while also setting up tents and tarpaulins all around its square, along the river banks and in the surrounding fields.

Until the city's unexpected bout of fame in 2000, history, like the waters of Drin rivers, had seemingly passed Kukës by for centuries. Founded by the ancient Illyrians, Kukës was a far-flung territory of the Roman, Byzantine and then Ottoman empires until Albania became an independent nation in 1912. After World War Two, people watched as ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were absorbed into the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while Kukës found itself on the frontier of Albanian prime minister Enver Hoxha's increasingly paranoid communist dictatorship.

Hoxha ruled Albania with an iron fist, building a vast network of underground tunnels and bunkers across the nation. Yet, those below Kukës, which were started in the 1970s and extend for some 7km beneath the city, are the largest in Albania, with enough space to shelter Kukës' entire population of in the event of war. The tunnels are still there, and Afrim Cenaj, whose father served below ground as an officer in the Albanian army in the 1980s, now leads tours into what locals call the ""underground city"".

Accessing one of the many hidden entrances dotted across Kukës, Cenaj guided me through a labyrinthine of dark passageways, occasionally lit by ventilation shafts and home to endless concrete shelters that now lie abandoned. Cenaj believes that communist relics like this will draw tourists to Kukës, and he's trying to secure a loan to turn an old barracks block above one of the secret entrances into a guesthouse. ""My father once guarded this place,"" he said when we finally emerged into the sunlight. ""And now I want to preserve it.""

Communist history abounds in Kukës, and the next day I met Ismailaj outside the headquarters of Radio Kukesi, where a giant communist relief depicting a heroic worker waving the Albanian flag adorned the entrance. Ismailaj is now a rock DJ, and she gave me a tour of the radio station and its small museum that was packed with dusty broadcasting equipment from a bygone era.

Radio Kukesi was founded by Hoxha's regime as a propaganda outlet and its reporters found themselves on the front lines of the Kosovo war in 1999. Photographs of refugees and UN relief convoys were pinned to the walls of the museum. Faded letters sent to Radio Kukesi by those fleeing the conflict showed how the names of people who'd made it to safety were broadcast back into Kosovo, letting their loved ones know they were alive.

""The first night of the exodus we hosted 13,000 refugees in Kukës,"" said Ismailaj, explaining that people were even sleeping on the floor of the radio station. ""This moment of history made Kukës so important that the world's media came here, reporting on the small town welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees.""

Richard Collett

While Kukës' Nobel nomination was historic, Ismailaj wonders if more residents would have felt compelled to stay had they won. ""Maybe today, if we were a Nobel Peace Prize winner, we would have had more investment, more attention from NGOs.""

Everyone I met in Kukës has friends and family working abroad, which is the primary reason why a new airport, which opened in 2022, now connects it to several major European cities. But it is also facilitating tourism, which in turn, is creating incentives for the next generation to stay. ""Most of my family have left,"" Cenaj told me. ""But my son is learning English. He's going to become a tour guide here in Kukës.""

With its colossal mountain peaks and turquoise river waters, it's easy to imagine Kukës and the surrounding region emerging as an adventure travel destination. In the village of Shistavec, a 45-minute drive into the mountains, wooden chalets have been built for skiers and hikers, and on day trips from Kukës, tourists can learn more about the mountain culture of the Gorani people who speak a Slavic language distinct from Albanian. Kukës is also a gateway to the recently opened High Scardus Trail that connects North Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo and traverses the border by Shistavec.

The worry in the Balkans, though, is that new conflicts are just a spark away, especially given that Kosovo's independence has never been recognised by Serbia. ""They have terrible memories,"" said Remzije Sherifi, a Kosovar journalist who fled her home during the 1999 conflict. ""People have lost entire families, others have loved ones still in prison or live in hope of returns that may never happen.""

By opening its doors to some 400,000 people, Kukës showed the world that even in the darkest moments, humanity prevails. Now, residents are hoping to share their stories of communism and conflict while also spreading their ideals of hospitality and peace.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/67657155,Jon Rahm joins LIV: Rory McIlroy says Spaniard must be on next European Ryder Cup team,['Author not found'],"Rahm and McIlroy were both part of Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States earlier this year

Rory McIlroy has performed a U-turn over his stance on LIV golfers playing in the Ryder Cup following Jon Rahm's decision to join the Saudi-funded tour.

The Northern Irishman said earlier this year that LIV players should not play for Europe against the United States.

However, after Rahm's announcement, McIlroy was adamant that the Spaniard plays at Bethpage, New York in 2025.

And in reply to a BBC Sport journalist questioning his change of heart on X, McIlroy replied: ""We need Jon.""

McIlroy was responding to a message posted by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English, which read: ""Rory's singing a different tune now that it's Rahm. Didn't hear this kind of chat from him about the others who joined LIV.""

The world number two replied to that message, writing: ""We didn't NEED any of the others in Rome and we didn't miss them. We'd certainly miss and need Jon at Bethpage.""

The innovation of LIV Golf persuaded Jon Rahm to join from the PGA Tour

McIlroy's about turn comes amid a turbulent time in the men's professional game.

In June 2023 the PGA and DP World Tours announced they had a 'framework agreement' to merge with the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), which bankrolls LIV and has pledged $2bn (£1.6bn) of support.

That agreement has a deadline of 31 December 2023 to be ratified, although the American government is examining the PGA Tour's plans to take massive investment from Saudi Arabia.

On Rahm's move, McIlroy told Sky Sports: ""Is it disappointing to me? Yes, but the landscape of golf changed on 6 June, when the framework agreement was announced, it legitimised basically what LIV was trying to do, and I think because of that it made the jump from the PGA Tour to LIV a little bit easier for guys.""

'Rewrite Ryder rules for Rahm'

World number three Rahm was unbeaten as Europe defeated the United States 16½-11½ to regain the Ryder Cup in Rome and McIlroy, who contributed four points to the victory, had earlier suggested Europe will have to ""rewrite the rules"" for eligibility.

Under current DP World Tour rules, Rahm would be eligible to play in the next contest but his switch to join the Saudi-funded LIV tour has put his participation at Bethpage in jeopardy.

European players must be members of the DP World Tour - previously known as the European Tour - to be able to play in the Ryder Cup.

Stalwarts of the team Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia were declared ineligible to play in this year's event after they resigned from the DP World Tour in May in the wake of being fined and banned for their involvement with LIV.

Rahm has signed his DP World Tour membership forms for the 2024 season and says he wants ""to maintain"" his status on the European-based circuit, while playing LIV events.

The eligibility criteria for the 2025 European Ryder Cup team will not be announced until next year, with the qualification period not beginning for at least another nine months.

Speaking in the immediate aftermath of Rahm's move, McIlroy said: ""Jon is going to be in Bethpage in 2025.

""Because of this decision, the European tour is going to have to rewrite the rules for Ryder Cup eligibility.

""There's absolutely no question about that - I certainly want Jon Rahm on the next Ryder Cup team.""

Rahm keen to retain PGA and DP World Tour membership

Rahm was given honorary life membership of the DP World Tour in 2022 after winning the previous year's US Open. He won his second major at the Masters earlier this year.

The Spaniard is also a member of the PGA Tour in the US. Players were suspended - or resigned - from the American-based circuit if they chose to compete in a LIV Golf tournament.

On retaining his membership on both the PGA and DP World Tour he said: ""I will not give that up and hopefully with the freedom that LIV Golf gives me I can play in both of those tours as well.

""I've expressed how important the Spanish Open is to me in the past, and if we ever reached that point [to play in] certain PGA Tour events, I still want to go and play as long as my schedule allows. So if possible, we'll see what we can make happen.""

Next year's Spanish Open takes place from 26-29 September. Of the 12 LIV events confirmed for 2024, the final one is in the US from 16-18 August. Rahm is also scheduled to be playing a LIV event in the US the week before the defence of his Masters title in April.

LIV's American players are eligible for their Ryder Cup team. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka was the only LIV player to appear at this year's event.

Europe switched captain midway through the two-year Ryder Cup cycle after Henrik Stenson opted to join LIV, with Luke Donald taking over.

Rahm, who had previously ruled out joining LIV, which had its inaugural season in 2022, made his third Ryder Cup appearance for Europe earlier this year.

""He has got so much talent, he's so tenacious and he's a great team-mate in the Ryder Cup,"" McIlroy said.

""The thing that I've realised is that you can't judge someone for making a decision that they feel is the best thing for them.""

Golf in danger of 'cannibalising' itself

McIlroy said he is worried the split between the PGA Tour and LIV ""divides eyeballs"" on golf.

""Some people like LIV, the majority of people like the PGA Tour, but if LIV start to take a few players each and every year it's really going to be divided and that's no good for anyone,"" he said.

""You're basically cannibalising yourself as a sport.

""To me, having all the best golfers under the one umbrella is the best way forward because I think that's really what the public wants.""

Rahm said his decision ""wasn't anything personal"" against the players on the PGA Tour and ""hopes the best for the future"" of the sport in a ""moving and changing environment"" which will eventually allow him to play across both formats.

""LIV Golf gives me the freedom to play golf when it doesn't conflict with the PGA Tour or DP World Tour and I certainly want to be part of that in the future,"" Rahm told Fox News.","European players must be members of the DP World Tour - previously known as the European Tour - to be able to play in the Ryder Cup.
The eligibility criteria for the 2025 European Ryder Cup team will not be announced until next year, with the qualification period not beginning for at least another nine months.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/67662285,Lewis Hamilton says FIA inquiry into Wolff 'unacceptable',['Author not found'],"Susie Wolff (left) is director of F1 Academy, the series for aspiring female racing drivers, while husband Toto Wolff (right) is the team principal of the Mercedes F1 team

Lewis Hamilton says the actions of Formula 1's governing body have been ""unacceptable"" in launching an inquiry into Toto and Susie Wolff.

The FIA on Thursday ended a conflict-of-interest investigation into the married couple - just two days after it began.

Hamilton said it was ""disappointing"" the FIA had ""sought to question the integrity of one of the most incredible female leaders we've ever had in our sport"".

He said it had done so ""without questioning [her], without any evidence"".

Hamilton did not directly reference Toto Wolff in his remarks, but he was also referring to the allegations against his team principal, who he had praised in an answer to an earlier question.

The seven-time world champion's comments, made in a news conference before the FIA's end-of-season prize giving gala in Baku, came after Mercedes made it clear they were considering all legal options.

Mercedes issued a statement from Toto Wolff on Friday saying the team were ""in active legal exchange with the FIA"" .

It said Mercedes ""reserved all legal rights"" and wanted ""full transparency about what took place and why"".

The statement can be interpreted to mean that Mercedes is seeking full redress from the FIA - including a retraction of all allegations, a statement saying it did not mean to damage the reputation of the company or Wolff, and a full apology.

In a separate statement, Susie Wolff described the FIA's behaviour this week as ""simply not good enough"", adding: ""As a sport, we must demand, and we deserve, better.""

Wolff - the managing director of the F1 Academy, a category for aspiring female drivers - said: ""I intend to follow up until I have found out who has instigated this campaign and misled the media.""

The FIA has so far failed to respond to BBC Sport's requests for comment.

Hamilton also questions FIA on sustainability

Hamilton said the FIA's actions this week illustrated a disconnect within its leadership on the subject of diversity, although he did not mention anyone by name.

The 38-year-old said: ""They have a lot of great people in the sport doing amazing work and there is a constant fight to really improve diversity and inclusion within the industry.

""But it seems there are certain individuals in the leadership within the FIA that every time we try and make a step forward they try to pull us back, and that has to change.

""This is a global sport and we have such an incredible opportunity and a responsibility to be leaders of change.

""I want to acknowledge that there are a lot of people who are doing great work. But we need some change to make sure we are all pushing in the right direction.""

He also questioned the FIA's decision to hold its gala in Azerbaijan, saying it undermined the organisation's claims to be promoting sustainability.

""There is a question in my mind whether the FIA is I really thinking actually about sustainability when so many people flew out here but the FIA is in Paris and it would have been easier to have it there,"" Hamilton said.

What is the row about?

The statements by Hamilton and the Wolffs are the latest developments in an extraordinary saga that has engulfed the FIA and its president Mohammed Ben Sulayem this week.

It started on Tuesday when the FIA said an ""allegation of information of a confidential nature being passed to an F1 team principal from a member of FOM (Formula 1 Management) personnel"" had been passed to its compliance unit.

It did not name the Wolffs, although it was referring to them.

The statement followed a magazine article alleging rival teams had complained to the FIA about confidential information potentially passing between F1 and Mercedes through the Wolffs.

But on Thursday the FIA said it was ""satisfied"" F1 had measures in place to protect against such issues, adding that there was ""no ongoing investigation"" on the subject.

In the two days between the inquiry starting and ending, Mercedes and F1 had issued statements rejecting the accusations and making clear their frustration with the FIA's handling of the matter.

And the nine other F1 teams all issued co-ordinated and identically worded statements saying they had had made no complaints to the FIA of this kind and that they were ""pleased and proud to support F1 Academy and its managing director"".

On Friday, Susie Wolff said in a statement on social media: ""When I saw the statement issued by the FIA yesterday evening, my first reaction was: 'Is that it?'

""For two days, insinuations have been made about my integrity in public and through background briefings, but nobody from the FIA has spoken to me directly.

""I might have been collateral damage in an unsuccessful attack on somebody else, or the target of a failed attempt to discredit me personally. But I have worked too hard to have my reputation called into question by an unfounded press release.

""We have come a long way as a sport. I was extremely thankful for the unified support of the F1 teams. I have worked with so many passionate women and men at F1 and the FIA, who have the very best interests of our sport at heart.

""However, this episode has so far taken place without transparency and accountability. I have received online abuse about my work and my family.

""I will not allow myself to be intimidated and intend to follow up until I have found out who has instigated this campaign and misled the media.""

Mercedes' statement concluded: ""We ask for your understanding that we will not be commenting officially for now, but we will certainly address the matter in due course.""

A damaging episode for the FIA president

The saga has left senior figures in F1 questioning the judgement of Ben Sulayem.

One described it as ""yet another own goal"" from the Emirati. Another said: ""It could be the beginning of the end for him.""

Mercedes, the Wolffs and F1 were not contacted before the FIA announced that it had referred an ""allegation of information of a confidential nature being passed to an F1 team principal from a member of FOM personnel"" to its compliance unit.

The controversy comes against a backdrop of worsening relations between F1 and the FIA on a number of fronts.

There is unease both inside the FIA and elsewhere in F1 about the way the direction of the governing body under Ben Sulayem.

Ben Sulayem said in February that he was stepping back from direct involvement in f1, a move that came after a series of controversies since he was elected president in December 2021. One of those was the emergence of past misogynistic remarks he had made on an archived website.

But Ben Sulayem has remained active behind the scenes and teams have viewed a series of incidents in recent months as being directly linked to him.

These include the decision to launch a second investigation into Lewis Hamilton crossing the track during the Qatar Grand Prix when he had already been fined and disciplined for it at the race weekend, and the decision to call Wolff and Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur to the stewards at the final race of the season for swearing in a news conference.","Susie Wolff (left) is director of F1 Academy, the series for aspiring female racing drivers, while husband Toto Wolff (right) is the team principal of the Mercedes F1 teamLewis Hamilton says the actions of Formula 1's governing body have been ""unacceptable"" in launching an inquiry into Toto and Susie Wolff.
Hamilton did not directly reference Toto Wolff in his remarks, but he was also referring to the allegations against his team principal, who he had praised in an answer to an earlier question.
Mercedes issued a statement from Toto Wolff on Friday saying the team were ""in active legal exchange with the FIA"" .

Saudi Arabia's sports minister says claims of 'sportswashing' against the country are ""very shallow"", as he defended its right to host the men's football World Cup.

Speaking to the BBC in Jeddah, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal said: ""A lot of the people that accuse us of that haven't been to Saudi, or seen what we are doing.""

Critics say unprecedented spending on sport has been used to improve the oil-producing kingdom's reputation over its human rights record and its environmental impact.

But the Saudi government insists the investment is boosting the economy, opening it up to tourism and inspiring people to be more active.

In his first interview since it emerged the country was bidding unopposed for the 2034 men's World Cup, the minister:

Said Saudi Arabia was ""studying the possibility"" of hosting the tournament in the summer, despite the kingdom's extreme heat

Backed the Fifa process that led to Saudi's World Cup bid emerging unchallenged, denying ""any lack of transparency""

Defended the Saudi Pro League's £750m summer transfer spending spree, arguing that ""nobody questioned [the Premier League] when they did it"", and that he was ""sure next year we'll have more attendance"" after small crowds at some games

Vowed the controversy over neighbouring Qatar's treatment of migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup was ""not going to be repeated""

Insisted ""everyone is welcome"" at the event, despite the concerns of some fans about a country where homosexuality is illegal and women's rights are restricted.

A suitable host?

Saudi Arabia has invested around £5bn in sports since 2021, when the country's Crown Prince made it a key part of his strategy to diversify the economy, with a host of major sporting events brought to the kingdom, including high-profile boxing and Formula 1.

The country's Public Investment Fund has also launched the breakaway LIV golf series, taken control of four Saudi Pro League clubs and purchased Newcastle United.

But campaigners claim this vast state investment into sport is being used to distract from long-standing reputation issues such as Saudi Arabia's human rights record, the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the war in Yemen - a process known as 'sportswashing'.

Speaking in Jeddah, where his country has recently hosted both an America's Cup regatta and ATP Tennis event for the first time, and is now preparing to host this month's Fifa Club World Cup, Prince Abdulaziz said accusations of 'sportswashing' were ""very shallow"".

""Twenty million of our population are below the age of 30, so we need to get them engaged - we are playing our role to develop sports within the world and to be part of the international community"" he said.

When asked if his country would be a suitable host of the 2034 World Cup, he added: ""We've showcased that - we've hosted more than 85 global events and we've delivered on the highest level. We want to attract the world through sports. Hopefully, by 2034, people will have an extraordinary World Cup.""

While campaigners acknowledge reforms over women's freedoms in Saudi Arabia in recent years, they also point to a reported rise in the number of executions, the continuing male guardianship system and the imprisonment of activists for online dissent.

Fifa has been urged to secure commitments to improving human rights before formally confirming a Saudi World Cup next year. According to Fifa guidelines, countries bidding to host the event must commit to respect human rights.

""Any country has room for improvement, no-one's perfect. We acknowledge that and these events help us reform to a better future for everyone"" claimed Prince Abdulaziz.

Women in Saudi Arabia were only allowed to enter sports stadia to watch matches in 2018, but since then a professional women's football league and national women's team has been created, with more than 70,000 girls now playing regularly.

However, last month Jake Daniels, the UK's only openly gay active male professional footballer, told the BBC he ""wouldn't feel safe"" at the 2034 World Cup.

""Everyone's welcome in the kingdom"" said Prince Adbulaziz. ""Like any other nation we have rules and regulations that everyone should abide by and respect. When we come to the UK we respect the rules and regulations, whether we believe in them or not. Through the 85 events that we have had so far, we haven't had any issues.""

A summer World Cup?

The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was held in November and December

It is widely expected that the 2034 tournament will be in winter to avoid the country's extreme summer temperatures, as with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

But Prince Abdulaziz said organisers were ""definitely studying"" whether it could be staged in summer.

""Why not see what the possibilities are to do it in the summer? Whether it is summer or winter it doesn't matter for us, as long as we make sure that we [deliver] the right atmosphere to host such an event"" he said.

Saudi Arabia is already building three new stadia for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, but must have 14 venues with capacities of 40,000 or more for the World Cup.

In October, human rights group Amnesty raised concerns external-link over the treatment of migrant workers in the kingdom.

When asked if there could be similar issues to the controversy that dogged the Qatar World Cup over workers' rights, Prince Abdulaziz said: ""I assure you it's not going to be repeated.

""We have 10 years to work on that, we already started in a lot of the venues, so we have a long time to do it in the right time, in the right process… We're already developing infrastructure… so we are not required to build a lot more to host such an event.""

Sustainability concerns

But environmental groups have expressed concerns over the environmental impact of staging a 48-team event, pointing to the energy required for cooling systems, the desalination of water and carbon-intensive infrastructure projects.

Referencing various initiatives that the Saudi government says is helping it to diversify away from fossil fuels and reduce omissions, Prince Abdulaziz said: ""It's a mandate on us in the kingdom to make sure that we abide by the international regulations… to make sure that we play our role, to make sure that it's eco-friendly.""

He also rejected criticism that the world's biggest oil exporter is using sport to distract from its record on sustainability, saying: ""I reject that completely because we are taking that seriously and thinking that we are part of this globe… and we have to play our role in that and we are doing that.""

In March, Fifa dropped plans for Saudi Arabia's tourism body to sponsor the Women's World Cup following a backlash from co-hosts Australia and New Zealand and some players about the proposed deal.

When asked about reports that state-owned oil giant Aramco is in talks over a sponsorship deal with Fifa, Prince Abdulaziz said: ""Aramco has been open to a lot of sponsors around the world in sports and they believe in sports because it's a good platform for them to develop and so on… they've sponsored Formula One, they've sponsored a lot of events around the world. I don't see what the issue is with Fifa - or is it just because it's Fifa?""

The bidding process

Concerns have been raised over the fast-tracked Fifa process that blocked most countries from bidding for the 2034 World Cup, and resulted in Saudi Arabia standing unopposed.

At the time of the announcement, fan group 'Football Supporters Europe' said it ""rolls the red carpet out"" for the country.

But Prince Abdulaziz rejected any suggestion that the governing body had paved the way for his country.

""It's just a theory,"" he said. ""What we should look at is what benefits the sport of football.

""Everyone was clear on the regulations, nobody objected to them during [the process] so I don't think there was any lack of transparency from Fifa. It was only that we were ready to do it and maybe others weren't. That's not our fault.

""As you can see from the announcement of more than 125 federations in support of the Saudi bid… the world also wants us to host 2034.""

Fifa has said that a full evaluation of bids for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups is still to be completed before votes by all national associations at its Congress next year, and said its rotation policy helps to grow the game.

Saudi Pro League

Cristiano Ronaldo is the most high profile player to have joined the Saudi Pro League

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo was the first notable figure to make the switch to the revamped Saudi Pro League last year. Since then a host of stars, such as Karim Benzema, Neymar, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Neves have followed suit, with £750m lavished on new signings this summer, sending shockwaves through football's transfer market.

""I think the Premier League did that and that's how they started. So nobody questioned them when they did it,"" said Prince Abdulaziz, when asked if the spending was a threat to more established European leagues.

BBC Sport attended the recent Riyadh derby between Ronaldo's Al-Nassr and rivals Al-Hilal while covering a number of events, accompanied by Ministry of Sport officials, during several days in Saudi Arabia. The game was played in front of more than 50,000 fans, but crowds at some smaller clubs have been as low as several hundred, with average attendances less than 9,000.

""It's building blocks… I'm sure that next year we'll have more attendance,"" said Prince Abdulaziz.

""Like anywhere in the world there's some matches that attract much more audience than others, but all of our big matches have attracted record numbers so far… we're broadcasting to 147 countries around the world.

""When we planned to develop the league we never thought that we would do it with such pace, but to see that is actually refreshing and it actually showcases the importance of this. Our focus is to develop our league to attract the best in the world.""","Hopefully, by 2034, people will have an extraordinary World Cup.""

Chelsea manager Emma Hayes says women are ""routinely used to dealing with systemic misogyny and bullying"" in football.

It follows comments ex-footballer Joey Barton made on X criticising women working in the men's game.

Barton, 41, said women ""should not be talking with any kind of authority"" about men's football.

""The realities are male privilege has always been at the centre of football in this country,"" Hayes said.

""I feel that sport is the last place in society where that male privilege exists.""

When asked about Barton's comments in a news conference on Friday, Hayes did not name the former Manchester City and QPR player directly.

""I don't expect any individual personality to understand their privilege. Nonetheless you only have to see scores of women across the internet or in the business - whether that's coaches, presenters, players - we're routinely used to dealing with systemic misogyny, bullying and behaviour that has been pretty normal for a large part of the football public.""

Hayes, who is set to leave Chelsea at the end of the season and become the United States women's national team head coach, has been in charge of the Blues since 2012 and guided them to six Women's Super League titles.

She has also worked as a pundit across men's and women's football, including for ITV at the men's Euros in 2021.

""If you haven't experienced systemic misogyny, like lots of us have, you can't for one moment understand how detrimental some of these conversations are knowing that anything anyone says just enables an absolute pile on, particularly on social media,"" she said.

""When it comes to the sport of football in this case, we have to remember that society isn't always as well represented across the media or across the game in coaching or playing.""

Last month, Barton, who was sacked as Bristol Rovers manager in October, was criticised for describing the racist murder of teenager Anthony Walker as a ""scrap"".

His brother Michael Barton was 17 when he was jailed for life alongside his cousin Paul Taylor in the 2005 killing of the 18-year-old with an ice axe.

In October 2022, Barton was cleared of assaulting his wife after a judge ruled he could not have a fair trial.

Barton has been criticised by fans and women in the industry, including TNT Sports presenter Laura Woods, who said external-link his comments ""encourage a pile on for the women getting on with their jobs"".

Speaking on Piers Morgan's TalkTV show on Thursday, he said the use of female pundits and presenters in men's football was part of a ""woke agenda"".

Hayes added that she wanted to ""accentuate the positive contributions"" of women in sport and highlighted that females working in other professions would not face the same scrutiny.

""We wouldn't go into a hospital and have a female physician who's carrying out a surgical procedure on someone's kidney - we wouldn't turn around and say to that surgeon 'I hope she's a good patient because being a good patient means you're going to be a good doctor'.

""It's the same about being a great banker - does that mean you have to be a frugal spender to be a good banker?

""Much in the same way, do you have to be a well-travelled passenger to be a good pilot?""

Hayes said that it is an ""interesting debate"" but one that could be ""done better or in another way"".","Emma Hayes: Chelsea manager says women are used to 'systemic misogyny'Chelsea manager Emma Hayes says women are ""routinely used to dealing with systemic misogyny and bullying"" in football.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67618832,Bukayo Saka & Gabriel Martinelli: The art of the modern winger & why Arsenal pair stand out,['Author not found'],"They may both play for my old club, but I'm not being biased when I say Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are the two modern-day wingers that I admire the most.

I'd love to be playing in this current Gunners team myself too, of course, because they are an exciting side that is expected to challenge for the title - but I would have to get in ahead of Saka down the right, and there would be no chance of that!

My old position itself has changed so much, in any case. I only retired in August but I don't see myself as having been a modern-day winger. Not in the way Saka and Martinelli operate, anyway.

Some of the demands of the role now probably don't quite work for me, in that part of the freedom I had in certain areas of the pitch has gone.

I was sort of old-school, in that I wanted to be direct and aggressive straight away, and put defenders on the back foot.

Now, it feels like the idea is more about draining the defender. So, a lot of the time the winger will dribble a bit but then he will come back out with the ball. The move continues and the same might happen again, and again, grinding them down.

That always keeps defenders guessing now, I suppose, because they don't have players driving at them down the flanks all the time any more, apart from a few exceptions in the Premier League.

Manchester City's Jeremy Doku is one. He's probably more old-school like I was, because he is just so direct. Michael Olise at Crystal Palace is another, and even Fulham's Adama Traore with his raw pace.

It's the same with Saka too. When I watch games now with my kids and talk to them about what a winger should be doing, I just love seeing positive play - and he is one of the most positive players out there. My son loves watching him, and so do I.

I've always admired wingers who, even if they lose the ball, keep trying to beat their man and Saka does that, and Martinelli as well. I am a huge fan of both.

But they are different from me because they can do it both ways - to be direct like I was, but also happy having more touches of the ball, keeping possession and coming inside to do their work for the team in other ways.

Saka (left) has scored 46 goals and made 52 assists in 200 Arsenal games in all competitions, and on average has a goal involvement every 2.04 games. Martinelli (right) has 37 goals and 22 assists in 148 games, averaging a goal involvement every 2.5 games

There are wingers now working 10 times as hard as I did

Saka and Martinelli are both really effective when they get on the ball in the pockets of space between the opposition midfield and defence.

But you don't get many wingers now who like to make runs in behind, like I did, because a lot of teams tend to drop very deep to defend against that.

Arsenal have found this a lot recently - the space for Saka and Martinelli to run into just isn't there any more.

That's one of the reasons they both maybe haven't quite been as explosive this season as they were last year, but I'd also say it's hard to maintain that kind of intensity when you have their defensive workload too.

Saka and Martinelli have played a lot of football in the past few months and you have to consider how hard they work, and how they have to do it over and over again, not just in an attacking sense but also without the ball: pressing, tracking runners and keeping tabs on their full-back.

I did that too, but I also remember playing in games where I'd be told not to come back past the halfway line, and that I didn't need to defend, which was music to my ears as an attacker. I would be thinking that just leaves me free to go forward, which is what I am going to be judged on.

There's so much more defensive work now, especially if you are playing as a winger for one of the lesser teams against someone like Arsenal or City, when you have to work so hard just to get the ball back.

Their fitness levels are so important and, compared to those times where I was told I didn't have to defend, they are probably working 10 times as hard and they are hardly ever in possession.

More touches, but what do you do with them?

Walcott scored 108 goals and made 80 assists in all competitions for Arsenal between 2006 and 2018, averaging a goal involvement every 2.11 games

It is still possible to run in behind defences sometimes - when I was on MOTD2 last week and watched Tottenham against Aston Villa, both teams held such a high line and there were opportunities for runners all the time. As someone who likes to run off the ball, I would have loved to have played in that game.

But the modern-day winger likes having the ball at his feet as well and having plenty of touches, without really having to directly affect the game in the way I always felt was important.

There is a generation now who love watching players having fun with the ball on YouTube - my kids do it, and there is nothing wrong with showing off your skills like that.

For me, though, I was just bothered about how I impacted the game - that's how I'd evaluate my performances. I could have had loads of touches, or hardly any at all, but all I would ask myself is what have I done with them.

It could be a small thing, but even if I was positive, won a corner and we scored from it, then the goal has come from me driving at my defender and trying to make something happen.

So, after every game, for me it was all about how many crosses have I made, how many shots have I had, and how many goals have I scored?

I scored a ton of goals for Arsenal, but I am not sure now that many wingers are judged on their goals and assists, when they really should be.

I look back on my career and think, yeah I have done that, but you get a lot of wingers who are fantastic dribblers and don't really have the stats to back that up.

Watch: Walcott's FA Cup final strike for Arsenal

Frustrating the opposition, or hurting them?

I always felt that the final third was the place for me to express myself, but I obviously understand why there is a need to be patient there sometimes.

When you are playing one of the top teams like City, Arsenal or Liverpool and you have been starved of the ball for a long time, you often just want to get your breath back.

So, the last thing you want after winning it back is for your winger to go at them and lose it straight away.

It's the same if you are winning a really tight game 1-0, then there is obviously no need to try to create something then.

Frustrating the opposition has always been a big part of a winger's role in situations like that, for example by holding on to the ball a bit more and waiting for the defender to come in tight to you.

It's how you see a lot of fouls won, particularly towards the end of games, but sometimes it feels like it is now happening too much, even early on.

16-year-old Walcott nets first FA Cup goal as Saints beat MK Dons

When I was playing, in the first part of the game, every time I got the ball I would be thinking about what I could do with it straightaway, to get at my defender and make his life difficult.

If I went at him the first time, but then didn't go at him again the next time, I could tell he was thinking, ""Phew, thank God for that.""

I wanted him to be frightened of me, and be constantly thinking about what I was going to do to beat him - whether it be running short and spinning, running behind or just making a run for the sake of it.

Sometimes I wouldn't even want the ball, or certainly not expect it, but it would keep the defender on his toes constantly, and guessing what I was doing.

I have had defenders go: ""Theo, you just don't stop moving"" - and I would be thinking ""Well, that's my job.""

Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott combined for plenty of Arsenal goals during their time playing together

But to be effective, you need technicians on the field that know your strengths. For instance, if I was playing with Cesc Fabregas and I saw he had time on the ball, I always made a run because he knew I would do that, and I knew he would look for me.

If I made the run and he didn't give it, then that was fine because someone else would get the ball. By making a positive move, I'd still affected play.

'Dad, were you faster than Mbappe?'

There's different types of wide attackers too, including inverted forwards like Mohamed Salah and Marcus Rashford, who love to come inside and shoot.

My son plays on the left and wants to be one of those kind of players, cutting in on his right foot, but when I'm training with him I encourage him to go on his left side too quite a lot.

Mbappe's highest speed during a game has been clocked at 38 km/h

I could rely on my raw pace to get me out of trouble, and I knew that if I knocked the ball down the outside then, most of the time, I could get around my defender that way.

Again, that is pretty old-school, and now I think you need to be able to mix it up.

One thing that hasn't changed, though, is how wing play is about getting the upper hand on your full-back, however you manage it.

Speed was one of my weapons, and my son asked me the other day if I was quicker than Kylian Mbappe.

I was like: ""Well I don't know… but when I was young I was really quick."" I mean, Mbappe is seriously fast but he is a bit different to me, because I was quick over the first 10 to 30 metres.

So I said it would have been a close race, but deep down I think I was a little bit quicker than him… just maybe not any more!

Theo Walcott was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","They may both play for my old club, but I'm not being biased when I say Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are the two modern-day wingers that I admire the most.
I only retired in August but I don't see myself as having been a modern-day winger.

So, a lot of the time the winger will dribble a bit but then he will come back out with the ball.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67627204,Pep Guardiola: Man City boss says poor Premier League run is a reality check,['Author not found'],"Pep Guardiola apologises to Kalvin Phillips for lack of game time

Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's winless streak serves as a reality check for his squad.

City go to Luton on Sunday and will be out to avoid going five games without a Premier League win following a 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa on Wednesday.

Guardiola has never gone five league games without a win in his career.

""When you are winning you are the best in the world - not winning it's a crisis,"" he said.

""It's always exaggerated.""

City have lifted the Premier League trophy for the past three seasons and last season won the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. The club have not gone five matches without a win since Mark Hughes was in charge in 2009.

Speaking on Friday, he alluded to some of his players having enjoyed life like a pampered pet.

""For a long time, we've lived like a cat and known how good we are,"" he said.

Guardiola, whose team have slipped to fourth in the Premier League, feels the current relative struggles on the pitch may prove to be a positive in resetting standards.

""See how difficult what we have done is, and what will be?"" he said. ""The bad results help you to understand it.

""It's not about complacency. Complacency is about arriving late to training, not training good, not doing a good job.

""But the fans and the media say 'Oh my God, they lose'. Four games without winning. It can be five, six. It can happen.

""But look at the next three [in the table]. How the teams do more and more, year by year. I see the hunger in the opponents. I see it.

""The players have to realise that it's not my words that can help, or our accomplishments. It's them on the pitch to say, 'Oh my god, the opponents are much better'.

""After that we can make a step forward. It's the only way.""

Guardiola says it is ""too simplistic"" to put City's latest setback, a 1-0 defeat at Villa Park, down to the absence of midfielder Rodri due to suspension.

He also feels City have proven in the past they can still win without midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who, his manager says, might find this month's Club World Cup comes ""too soon"" in his comeback from a hamstring injury, even though he has been named in the squad for the seven-team event in Saudi Arabia.

Guardiola 'so sorry' for Phillips

City are in fourth place in the Premier League having drawn three and lost one of their last four matches

Despite the downturn in results, England midfielder Kalvin Phillips has not been on the pitch for a single minute, which underlines Guardiola's lack of faith in the £45m signing from Leeds.

""I feel so sorry for my decisions for him,"" Guardiola said. ""He doesn't deserve not to get minutes.

""I am asking for good personality, good character, thinking about the end. This is a perfect example. After that I have to give him something and I didn't do that.

""It's just because I visualise the team and struggle a little bit to see him, that's all.""

With Rodri back at Kenilworth Road, City are heavy favourites to end their wait for a win, even though both Liverpool and Arsenal have struggled on the same pitch already this season.

Guardiola says he is not blocking the outside noise. He just wants his players to prove their doubters wrong.

""The intention is not to block anything,"" he said.

""The important thing for us is to face reality. We're not used to four games without winning.""","Pep Guardiola apologises to Kalvin Phillips for lack of game timePep Guardiola says Manchester City's winless streak serves as a reality check for his squad.

Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag and defender Harry Maguire have won November's Premier League manager and player of the month awards.

United lost four of their first seven league matches this season but have since climbed to sixth in the table.

They won November's three league matches - against Fulham, Luton and Everton - without conceding.

Maguire, who struggled for game time at the start of the season, played every minute in the three victories.

The 30-year-old becomes the first United defender to win the award since Nemanja Vidic in January 2009.

""Couldn't have done it without my team-mates, the staff and you fans. Your love and support doesn't go unnoticed, I appreciate it,"" Maguire said on X external-link after winning the award.

Maguire was stripped of the United captaincy by Ten Hag in July and looked set for a move away from Old Trafford before the start of the season.

However, he turned down an offer from West Ham to stay at United, even though the club accepted a £30m bid for the England centre-back.

He topped a six-player shortlist that also included Manchester City's Jeremy Doku, Newcastle's Anthony Gordon, Luton goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski, Raheem Sterling of Chelsea and Bournemouth winger Marcus Tavernier.

United ended October eighth in the Premier League after a 3-0 derby defeat by Manchester City, but Ten Hag, who claims a third Premier League manager of the month award, has guided his side to sixth - nine points behind leaders Arsenal.

'It's up to Rashford'

Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag says it's 'up to' Marcus Rashford to rediscover form

Ten Hag has said it is up to Marcus Rashford to force his way back into United's starting line-up after he was dropped to the bench for Wednesday's 2-1 win over Chelsea.

Rashford, 26, was criticised for his performance in the 1-0 defeat by Newcastle on Saturday, with former Magpies striker Alan Shearer saying he ""didn't look interested"".

The England forward scored 17 league goals for the Red Devils last season, but has netted just two in the 2023-24 campaign so far.

""Rashford is an incredible, good player,"" Ten Hag said on Friday.

""You can't do it with 11 players, he can't play every game, he's not in this moment in the form he was last year but I am sure he will get there.

""It is up to them [to get back into the side]. The team will always line themselves up and the best players who form the best team will play.""

United's top scorer this season is midfielder Scott McTominay, who scored both goals in the victory against Chelsea.

Ten Hag said McTominay and Maguire's recent contributions to the team is what he expects from every player.

""I think we have a squad and in the squad there is internal competition. If you want a successful season you need more than 11 players,"" the Dutchman said.

""They are here, they are great players and have played into the team. That's what you expect from every player, there has to be dedication to aim for this.""
